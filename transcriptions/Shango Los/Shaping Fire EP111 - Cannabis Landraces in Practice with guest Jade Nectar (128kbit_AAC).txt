[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes old things hold a lot of value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is true that I like fancy hotel rooms,
but honestly, I get the best sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: sleeping at my friend's old beach cabin
that still has quilts and afghans that his
[SPEAKER_00]: grandmother and probably his
great-grandmother made.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cabin smells of old wood, seawater,
and late loud nights of laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing board games and euchre,
and quiet early mornings staring at the
[SPEAKER_00]: crashing surf while the others are still
asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is also true I am grateful for the
prescriptions that help my autoimmune
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, but honestly, I have gotten far
more lifelong health from Paul Pitchford's
[SPEAKER_00]: book, Healing with Whole Foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbalists and traditional nutritionists
know a lot that is lost to modern
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's episode is about slowing down and
realizing the good to be found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural past so that maybe we can embrace
it in our hectic present.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn about cannabis'
health, cultivation, and technique

[SPEAKER_00]: This month's giveaway from Dino Myco
Mycorrhizal Inoculant is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different than how we normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 200 people to follow the link on
the Shaping Fire Instagram profile or on
[SPEAKER_00]: the Shaping Fire website page for this
episode and fill out the form on the Dino
[SPEAKER_00]: Myco website will receive a free 20 gram
package of Dino Myco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to pay for shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used Dino Myco for five seasons now
and it clearly drastically improves root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Young plants grow faster and more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: New soil matures more swiftly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizal networks expand and thicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 111.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Jeff Nordahl,
better known on Instagram as Jade Nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff has been studying cannabis,
natural medicine, and psychedelics since
[SPEAKER_00]: his teens.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a background as an early internet
entrepreneur but became seriously ill in
[SPEAKER_00]: his 30s only to find out he had contracted
Lyme disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conventional medicine held no solutions
for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff turned to cannabis medicine in his
home of Santa Cruz and started getting
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: He became an expert on the acid form of
cannabinoids and cannabis leaf juicing and
[SPEAKER_00]: started a local medical collective to get
it in the hands of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Nordahl now holds 11 patents for
using cannabis as food, though he doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: like patents and got them defensively so
no one could ever tell him to stop juicing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis leaves for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is presently building out the Jade
Grove Farm and Wellness Center deep in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Cruz mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also has grown more land race varieties
of cannabis than anyone I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set today, we will
discuss the difference between land race,
[SPEAKER_00]: wild, feral, heritage, and hybrid
varieties of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second set, we will learn about the
cultivation demands of land races,
[SPEAKER_00]: hot and cold adapted land races,
and hear about some of the more exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology and terpene profiles Jeff has
come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the third set, we will explore
breeding with land races and finish the
[SPEAKER_00]: episode with a discussion of land race
preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, ever since I came across your
Jade Nectar profile on Instagram and
[SPEAKER_00]: started watching your tours of all the
land races in your garden, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately kind of became a fanboy,
I must say, just watching your videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, look at that plant and oh,
look at that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was like the same reason I
love going through botanical gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just once you fall in love with
plants, you know, I started with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant, but then that love kind of
became all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be able to see lots of varieties of
a plant together, it's it's really like
[SPEAKER_00]: nerdy nature fun for people like us who
cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then to see your Instagram where it's
just one after another and they look
[SPEAKER_00]: different in the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you've got a bit of
teaching vibes about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you kind of tell us about the
plant and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just started as a fanboy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fan and a follower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after I went through enough of
your videos over time, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, dude, I think I think I think this
would make a really great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really grateful that that you you
accepted my invitation to come on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, if you're enjoying it through
the video, just through the interwebs,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, you should come out in person
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it doesn't it doesn't experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take much of encouragement to
get me to come to Santa Cruz, one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite places in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when people talk about land
races, people use that word kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people don't understand
the idea of land race or where that
[SPEAKER_00]: definition begins or ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it then it starts to get mixed in
with other words like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like heritage and heirloom and and,
you know, varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so the definition is is a bit
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so let's let's kind of talk around this
idea and tease out some of the interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: meanings, especially somebody like you,
who who spends their whole time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the land race world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine you would have a different
take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so why don't we just go ahead and
start with like the word land race?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why don't you get us started there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to do my own research as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting that even different
industries and such have different
[SPEAKER_01]: definitions for what land race is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turns out that land race,
I believe, but I think it's a German word
[SPEAKER_01]: for land Ross, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means and that translates into
English like country breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right off the bat, land race is
domestic.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are domesticated varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also have land race dogs and
pigs, chickens, cucumbers, melons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nothing specific to cannabis
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with just agriculture or
animal breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and what but what it is and why land
races are unique is they're actually tied
[SPEAKER_01]: to a specific region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this interplay between.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say a cannabis plant shows up in
some area, let's say in, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you've got a wet tropical
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people who want to grow the
cannabis there are going to be now
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding with with their cannabis,
taking cues from the environment over
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say they grow 100 plants,
but 50 percent if they were, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: like an Afghan or arid environment genetic
that that came to this village in
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand, you know, hundreds, if not
thousands of years ago, probably half of
[SPEAKER_01]: them would mold because they're not
adapted for all that moisture and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the humans would start picking,
you know, and taking the seeds from the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that actually fared pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now there's human selection going on to
find those seeds or those genetics that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually thrive in their local
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once that gets established,
as far as something that can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: survive and make it to the finish line and
produce flowers without melting down,
[SPEAKER_01]: now the humans might start selecting more
for effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say I like a really or like those that
culture may actually appreciate a very
[SPEAKER_01]: energizing, electric, psychedelic effect
in their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they start selecting for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're starting to infuse cultural
values and cultural utility into this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, while also selecting for things
that actually thrive in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the interplay for
landrace is it happens over time with
[SPEAKER_01]: pressures from the environment and also
the aesthetic and desire and utility of
[SPEAKER_01]: the humans who are growing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if these were isolated from all other
cannabis plants, you can imagine over,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, generations and generations,
50 generations, a hundred generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're going to have a very unique
cannabis variety that's unique just to
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular, let's say, village.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, Jeff, I think I'm
going to set you up for your next
[SPEAKER_00]: definition because, you know, you've
already surprised me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The definition of landrace already is not
what I thought it was going to be because
[SPEAKER_00]: I was under the impression that landraces
were untouched by humans, that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: like, as soon as you said, domesticated,
I'm like, my, my eyebrow goes up because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like domesticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is one of the biggest,
biggest, uh, I, I don't know where the
[SPEAKER_01]: genesis of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I talking about wild versus landrace?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about wild or feral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so landrace is a hundred percent
influenced by humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are domestic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so if we want to start talking
analogies, here start thinking,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, as far as dog breeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, if anyone's familiar with,
let's say Anatolian shepherds or Kangal
[SPEAKER_01]: dogs, these are, uh, these big,
uh, sheep, uh, protector guard dogs that
[SPEAKER_01]: are used in the Anatolian mountains in
Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they require a very large,
uh, dog to fight off wolves and bears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they need to be very independent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they actually go out with the sheep
without any humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll just watch after the sheep,
but also go and hunt and provide food for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the Anatolian shepherds,
it's not a specific, uh, standard breed
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, has to be 16 inches from
tail to snout or any of these standard
[SPEAKER_01]: breed dimensions, uh, within the Anatolian
shepherd or Kangal, uh, type of dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you actually get all different color
types, all different, uh, variations,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and such, but they're, but at the same
time they're similar and they perform a
[SPEAKER_01]: utility, which is guarding sheep and being
independent and also, uh, being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: handle the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a really nice double coat
that keeps them insulated in the winter,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, cool in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, so that's an Anatolian shepherd.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have things like huskies,
uh, Eskimo dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see there's tons of variants in
those dogs, uh, between each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a lot of genetic diversity,
but it's also bred by humans to pull dog
[SPEAKER_01]: sleds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but there's no, uh, you know,
like kennel clubs sitting there going and
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring the dogs for specific traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are actually considered land
race dogs and you can apply the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to carrots, cucumbers, pigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I find it very interesting that
now, now in my head, um, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural use and, uh, human intention is
now part of the land race definition for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a, and that's a surprise for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's, let's move forward and,
and, and have you talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the feral and wild type, which is
what is in my head as land race.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, um, and by the way, I have read
websites, cannabis websites that just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of become these echo chambers that just
poach other information and just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: repeating the same fallacy over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason, there are cannabis
websites that do define land race as wild,
[SPEAKER_01]: untouched by humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we all know that most of the
cannabis websites are garbage anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just people trying to throw up
content so they can sell advertising,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so right off the bat, just land race
is fully domestic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do a Google search of the definition
of land race and you'll find out the first
[SPEAKER_01]: thing it says is it's a domestic breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, honestly, even more important than
that, like you're friends with Rob Clark,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So your definitions are bounced off a Rob
Clark, the God of cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I'm going to go with what you're
going to say more than what I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: read just about anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's, here's another thing and I
don't want to get in like pissing matches
[SPEAKER_01]: with people who say, Oh no, it's,
it's wild cannabis and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just went, luckily I'm very fortunate
and honored to have, um, uh, developed a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a relation with, uh, Rob Clark and
he came out and visited.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been out to our farm now,
uh, three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just no particular agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just like hanging out, you know,
we got 300 land race varieties all growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the same garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of just sort of wonderland,
uh, for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cannabis amusement park is what it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really it's stoner fantasy land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's just, so anyway, he was kind
enough to also, uh, send an email with
[SPEAKER_01]: his, uh, takes on these, these definitions
just to clear things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and yeah, I'll, if, if okay,
not to be super boring, I'll just read a
[SPEAKER_01]: few sentences from, from his actual email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope this he said it's okay to share
this, but yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long as they're not too long,
we'll go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right off the bat, land races are
essentially locally adapted plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: animal varieties that in that evolve in
response to natural environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: selective pressures in tandem with simple
human selection for favorable
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics without formal breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and it says all domestic plants
and animals originated from wild popular
[SPEAKER_01]: populations evolving naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once humans entered the scene,
the first steps towards land race
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution began.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not, it's not a, uh, just keeping
one line of, of breeding a particular
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic for just, you know, like that
ultimate seed or clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's not a narrow breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a big, large, wide sort of
open pollination, usually type breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project, but then selecting most likely
what would happen is then you go and
[SPEAKER_01]: select the seeds from the plants that
finished the best out of, let's say a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole patch, like a large field of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, the ones that made it to the
finish line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you sample them,
they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go, ah, I want to grow the seeds
from this plant next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that way the human is now very
much influencing and selecting for their
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that is the land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other part that's really
important is, um, is that they're unique
[SPEAKER_01]: to that region because now they've been
isolated in that physical geographic
[SPEAKER_01]: region.
[SPEAKER_01]: For so long that they're now like totally
unique compared to, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: land races in other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we've established land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our, our wild and feral synonymous or
those individual ideas too.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, as far as running the analogy,
the dog analogy, uh, what, what feral is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's domestic cannabis that has escaped
the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's off growing wild,
but it's not actually the true wild
[SPEAKER_01]: original cannabis variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like post farm wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be like, uh, in Australia,
if we're doing our dog analogy here,
[SPEAKER_01]: this would be the dingo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the dingos were in a domestic dog that
was introduced into Australia,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like 4,000 years ago or,
or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it went totally feral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's actually part of the ecosystem in
Australia, but it was never actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: wild naturally occurring wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was, it was actually, it was never
indigenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was brought in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a domestic dog that then went,
uh, feral and now as part of that
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is very adaptable and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it escapes the farm, and by the way,
in the Midwest, in the U S we still have a
[SPEAKER_01]: ditch weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's escaped hemp from the hemp farms,
you know, the early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's still growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when, when a plant goes feral,
it's now doesn't have that human,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, infusion or intention going on with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's, now it's just the plant doing
its thing with its only motivation is to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep making more seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most likely when you have feral
populations, um, the taste, the potency of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC or whatever cannabinoid you're going
for is the, you know, the plant doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even care about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wants to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're going to get, you know,
a hardier, more adaptive for survival and
[SPEAKER_01]: reproducing plant for the cannabis plant,
but, uh, probably the desirable human
[SPEAKER_01]: traits are going to start fading on those
feral populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I identify with feral.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm falling further and further
out of normative society as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, if you went full off the grid and,
uh, went and lived in a hut or a cave out
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of the night and started
raising a family and such like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the full embrace of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be then more adapted for hunting and
gathering and not, uh, sitting at a social
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's contract the contrast then that
to wild, which would be the, which would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably be a plant that is indigenous to
that bios fear, but has never been
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticated and farmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is most likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and again, this is from Robert Clark,
who also has, uh, sort of combined all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's got a great book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's called ethnobotany
cannabis, ethnobotany, uh, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, it goes and actually it's very
information dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a heavy duty read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a casual sit by the fire
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it is a really, really,
really a great resource for going and he,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what they've done is just tracked and
basically agree with all these other,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, botanists and scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scientists and ethnobotanists who've
tracked the original origin of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to come from what's now
geographically in China.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that is where the original wild
cannabis seemed to originate from,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because cannabis, domestic cannabis
was cultivated and used for 10,000 plus
[SPEAKER_01]: years in that same area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's highly unlikely that the original
wild cannabis didn't get crossed with
[SPEAKER_01]: domestic cannabis at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to differentiate the true wild origin
cannabis from a feral domestic cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it's kind of almost impossible to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most likely, uh, it went extinct
through hybridization with other,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, domestic varieties over the past
10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so most likely the original wild
cannabis no longer exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the cap off this line of
definitions, why don't we finish off with
[SPEAKER_00]: poly hybrid and then we'll start talking
about morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one other one that's part of this
is also heirloom or heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's more, uh, those would be
specific breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times sort of like, uh,
we've got it going on in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially up in humble and Mendocino and
such, um, actually was just reading about
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these, uh, the huckleberry hill
farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I got to sample some of their,
uh, white thorn rose, uh, which I guess is
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a lot of attention right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, that is the only like,
cannabis from a dispensary, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've sampled in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like, wow, that's really,
that took me back to like Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_01]: parking lot, kind bud, old school,
really, really, really beautiful cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but I looked into their story and
such, and I think a lot somewhat in that
[SPEAKER_01]: lineage, he calls it, uh, like mom's weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be like heirlooms where
families actually have worked and
[SPEAKER_01]: developed their own, you know,
strain and pass that down through the
[SPEAKER_01]: generations to like family and friends and
such like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like an heirloom right there
where it's, where it's being passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just warms my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just even thinking about looking at the,
at the genetic line and, and seeing mom's
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, like that is the heart of cannabis
and like the human relationship with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's like, it's like pre the names,
pre the, the, you know, categories for
[SPEAKER_00]: sale and, and pre competition between
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, yeah, this was, this was our
family's particular strain that we loved
[SPEAKER_00]: and we had at our holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think that's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mom's heirloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's kind of more like
heirloom where it's being passed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just like heirloom furniture and
such that you're passing it through
[SPEAKER_01]: generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, but then heritage strains would
follow that same pattern or sort of be in
[SPEAKER_01]: that same category, only that might be
more widely distributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and a lot of times heritage or,
or heirlooms exist only in a clone
[SPEAKER_01]: cuttings form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they may back them up with seeds,
but a lot of times things, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like train rack, AK 47, and then old
school, even, even, I guess like old
[SPEAKER_01]: school, super silver haze, Northern lights
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are more like the heritage,
like original foundation strains that did
[SPEAKER_01]: get passed, passed around through the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, let's go back to the poly hybrid
then and then cap off with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now poly hybrids and there's nothing
wrong or unethical or things to be snooty
[SPEAKER_01]: about with poly hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just now what seems to be going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't just, I mean, this is my
personal opinion, but a lot of other folks
[SPEAKER_01]: are coming to the same conclusion is if
we're going to do our dog breeding analogy
[SPEAKER_01]: again, most of the modern cannabis that's
now on the scene is like the labra doodle
[SPEAKER_01]: times 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you've got labra doodles crossed to
pug doodle or Puggles back to a pit bull,
[SPEAKER_01]: back to a labra doodle, back to a Cocker
Spana doodle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all this, and it almost doesn't
even have any necessarily any intention
[SPEAKER_01]: for like, Oh, I want to create like a
really racy high creative variety that
[SPEAKER_01]: tastes like passion fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gelato was hot last month and wedding cake
is hot right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to cross those two and call
this gelato cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, just on its face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds less reputable because you're,
you're breeding for marketing hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of breeding, to go back to your
dog example, breeding for the dog that
[SPEAKER_00]: taken cake, take care of the sheep and
feed itself in the wild, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one has authentic human cultural
meaning and the other one is for
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, yeah, it's like top 40 hits
like these just very, just riding hype for
[SPEAKER_01]: the next 30, 60 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like if people were hanging
outside, like a dog show, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a breeders, I don't know,
these kennel club dog shows and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh, your dog won the best interior
class and yours won the best in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how about we just cross them together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we have a Doberman schnauzer or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like the hot new dog that's going
to win the next year's kennel club,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and then you just do that
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have like all these, whoever won all
the cups or whatever is getting attention,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you just cross all that stuff
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just become this muddled,
muddled, muddled genetics and the effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not just me saying this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard this confirmed and there's a lot
of consensus seems to be going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: community at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you can't really tell the difference
between smoking rants or wedding cake or
[SPEAKER_01]: Oreos or peanut butter cookie breath or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it all basically kind of tastes
looks and all kind of feels the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately it's not, I mean,
everyone has different objectives and such
[SPEAKER_01]: with their stoner prism and what they're
going for and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people like that up,
like a creative, uplifting, inspiring,
[SPEAKER_01]: clear head and such, and feeling active
and kind of amplifying life where now a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the cannabis varieties right now
seem to be more of like an albeit
[SPEAKER_01]: sedative, kind of lethargic tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's that, it's that, it's that
mirror scene dominance that's all through
[SPEAKER_00]: the modern commercial strains,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just, yeah, so, and to each
their own, it's not to be snot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a time and place for couch
lock and such, but yeah, if, if every
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis variety now that you find a
dispensary gives you that same couch lock,
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot my name, I'm just going to sit in
my underwear and play video games and eat
[SPEAKER_01]: pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's the same effect you've,
you've now, it's kind of like all,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the vast world of all these different
dog breeds with all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: personalities and fun characteristics have
now all been sort of hybridized and
[SPEAKER_01]: homogenized into this just blah,
same exact uniform kind of boring effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you know, it's,
it's not to the fault of the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumer or enthusiast either,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, the vast majority,
like 99% of what's available is the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: polyhybrid stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've been, I've been a
cannabis enthusiast for, geez,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30, 35, 40 years now, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and, and it wasn't until I
came across, my buddy shared with me some
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings of an authentic Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, this is what all those
people who were 10 years older than me
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking about, about, because the
high was so entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then I decided, I'm like,
well, I can't grow that here where I live
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was, I was able to get some,
oh, actually he's from your area,
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Miner of HBK Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he used to live in the, in the Santa
Cruz region.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he's got this 20 week black Colombian
land race that I grew indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like those two plants are unlike
everything else that I have smoked and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have grown just because, and,
and so, you know, when, when, when you,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you say that, okay, the, you know,
your, your, your pound cake tastes like
[SPEAKER_00]: your cookies, tastes like your this or
that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because the modern commercial
cannabis, it's pulling from this very
[SPEAKER_00]: small pool of, of, of commercially viable
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know, if those same people
were able to get access to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, equatorial plants and Thai and
Columbia and all these, and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then smoke them against each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, suddenly their taste palette has
expanded and now they see that they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they see that they've been looking
down right at this particular genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: pool, but not the, not the global genetic
pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of times when, when I break
out, yeah, like an Acapulco or a Thai
[SPEAKER_01]: variety, or just right now loving some
stuff from Sri Lanka.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, a lot of these land races
that we're growing are seeds that were
[SPEAKER_01]: sourced back in the seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not even, so you're geographically
traveling and culturally traveling,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're also time traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this myth that now the weed
today is stronger and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you sample like a 1970s Pakistan
or 1970 Sri Lankan, or some of these old,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people who went on the hippie
trail or worked at the Peace Corps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at some of these areas and brought back
seeds, you know, from almost 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you grow them out and smoke them
and you're like, Oh my God, that yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: the weed was incredibly psychedelic back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a whole different category.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost verging on psilocybin,
like, you know, like a low dose of
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the, a lot of the modern,
you know, enthusiasts, they haven't had
[SPEAKER_00]: that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're just all like, Oh,
but the, the percentage THC on those older
[SPEAKER_00]: strains were so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've got this thing that somehow
is over 30 and you know, and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but a lot of these smokers don't
understand the important role that
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent terpenes placed in those older
strains, in these untouched strains that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they might be 12 or 18%,
but their terpene percentage is so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what sculpts the high,
the experience that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and that's where the real
difference comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not, it's not about the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the whole bouquet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the symphony orchestra.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you have the bassoons and the
timpanis and you have the cellos and
[SPEAKER_01]: you've French horns going on and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't play a major role, but they add
so much texture and counterpoint and
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity within the sound that there's
this whole communication going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now what seems to be going on with if
there's always so much real estate on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're up at 30, 35% THC,
that's kind of like the symphony
[SPEAKER_01]: orchestra.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only so much stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means you have to kick out all the
other instruments to make way for now you
[SPEAKER_01]: have 200 violin players.
[SPEAKER_01]: All playing the exact same note.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just playing the exact same
melody and it's still, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still, yeah, you've just lost all
that complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's more of a one dimensional
buzz experience without, instead of this
[SPEAKER_01]: big symphony tapestry of textures and
counterpoints and polyrhythms and such
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, yeah, that's kind of one analogy
and you could even go like Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry Garcia style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have so much show and you and I
are both dead heads and that will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually want to move forward off of
the definitions and because we're coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up on a commercial not too far from now,
but I want to get some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas in here that, you know, sometimes
let's take that black Colombian I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned earlier as an example.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we, meaning cannabis
cultivators that are growing now,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will get something like a Colombian or
a Syrian or, you know, wherever this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular land race has come from and
people treat it like that is not just an
[SPEAKER_00]: example, but that is the type of plant
that everybody in, you know, Columbia or
[SPEAKER_00]: Sri Lanka, you mentioned earlier,
as if one, that one plant is the only
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that is grown there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and, and I just liked you
to talk to that idea because I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a real common misnomer in the
model modern cannabis world that just
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've had one plant from,
you know, a growing region that you've had
[SPEAKER_00]: what they have to offer, you know,
and, and, and I just really feel like that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's so that's not reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all you have to do is go to Mendocino
or go to Big Sur, even go back and in
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you know, 50 years ago when things
were, you know, more on the down low,
[SPEAKER_01]: but was every single family and every
single grower growing the exact same
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's, and it's not in Sri Lanka or
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not like a cannabis club where
they all vote on what genetics every
[SPEAKER_01]: single cannabis farm is going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is going to be the official
genetic of their growing region?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're all, they're all doing their
own thing, but they're also kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, one, they probably, you know,
are sourcing their genetics from similar
[SPEAKER_01]: gene pools, just because the world hasn't
been globalized for all that long,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So limited, you know, genetic resources,
they're, they're going to pull from things
[SPEAKER_01]: they have in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they're also, you know,
going to also select for things that do
[SPEAKER_01]: well in that same region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have similarities,
but are they all going to be exact carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: copies of each other?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminds me of your Huckleberry
Hill example from earlier, where back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetic line is mom's favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, in Sri Lanka, it's not,
they're just producing one kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these different families have got
their mom's favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, they've got just as much
diversity as, as we're experiencing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that seeds are so hard to get
from these areas that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one variety makes its way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then unfortunately becomes
the example for the whole region,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the only thing we're able
to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they, they will be similar though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's happening now though in
Thailand is all the Amsterdam and Cali
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics are coming in and polluting their
land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's the really scary thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole nother topic of discussion,
but we may be experiencing a global land
[SPEAKER_01]: race extinction due to hybridization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically like, if, you know,
if you let, labradoodles out to Rome free
[SPEAKER_01]: and they went and basically copulated with
every dog breed on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now everything's been doodled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, I don't have anything
against doodle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a schnoodle, a schnauzer
poodle, a mixed dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes your point though.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm saying is, do we want to live in
a world where every dog breed has been
[SPEAKER_01]: doodled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and every cannabis has been cookie
cake gelato, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hey, I don't think, I don't think
I'm going to top, don't doodle your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis anywhere anymore in this,
in this first set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, let's, let's end there and go
for commercial break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we come back, we're going to
start talking about turpene profiles in
[SPEAKER_00]: land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead, let's go ahead and take
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I say one other tiny, tiny little
thing about the land race and that whole
[SPEAKER_01]: wild sort of feral definition and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a really important thing for
sort of ethics morals of, of land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the definition that some folks have
worked up, the wrong definition that land
[SPEAKER_01]: races are just kind of wild and feral and
growing on the side of the road also sets
[SPEAKER_01]: up a situation of appropriation and
complete erasing of the farmer who
[SPEAKER_01]: developed the land race variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, maybe in the U S if you all of a
sudden have some really cool Thai variety,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, if you're totally discounting that
this is probably hundreds of years of
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic work by actual humans in Thailand,
in whatever region or village who created
[SPEAKER_01]: this like total totally sublime variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if you think that it was just growing
on the side of the road, wild,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden there's no credit,
there's no honor, there's no respect for
[SPEAKER_01]: those farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're more apt to just name it
something or even call it your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've just erased the human work that
actually got that strain to that sublime
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just really important for land
race to also fully credit these amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, intuitive breeders who develop
these like absolutely sublime varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of human work went in to get them
to this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just cause you took a vacation to
Thailand and brought back some seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean you created that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that I'm glad that you held
me up to put that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's go to commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take that short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is land race
specialist, Jeff Nordahl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, without these advertisers
shaping fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know
that you heard them on shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side by sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_00]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping fire listeners can get 10% off any
size of Dynomyco on Dynomyco.com by using
[SPEAKER_00]: the discount code shaping fire,
one word, no caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots, or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_00]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an
all-natural fish poop concentrate with
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real fish poop is extraordinarily complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you adding the nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium your plants need
[SPEAKER_00]: to build mass, transport nutrients,
and enhance flavor, but fish waste is also
[SPEAKER_00]: packed with biological activity and
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add fish poop to your irrigation
water, you are adding life force,
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotics, and active microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microorganisms include a wealth of
various bacteria and protozoa which
[SPEAKER_00]: further enhance nutrient availability for
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because plants are limited by the absence
of any essential micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_00]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop is a naturally complete solution
that fills in the cracks in your
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer program to ensure you offer
your garden a broad base of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all fish poop is created equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most products with added fish waste don't
reveal their sources or lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop brand fish poop, however,
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_00]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: koi and tilapia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are even invited to tour their farm in
person or on their YouTube channel to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sort of transparency is wildly rare
in the fertilizer market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks behind fish poop are also
lifelong medical cannabis producers who
[SPEAKER_00]: have deep connections in the community,
donate more product than they sell,
[SPEAKER_00]: and support cannabis prisoner,
veteran, and patient collectives and
[SPEAKER_00]: charities.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get your bottle of pure fish poop,
go to fishpoop.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see their entire line of cannabis
products, go to ounceofhope.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fish poop brand fish poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard me talk about the
award-winning cannabis seeds that come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the analytical breeding program of
Seth and Eric Crawford, who founded Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Seth was a guest on Shaping Fire
in 2020 to talk about triploid genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC
seeds for home growers and farms as Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the Revolution Seeds at gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their high THC seeds are extraordinary in
that they will start to flower at 16 and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half hours of daylight instead of the
typical 14 and a half hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means in most regions, your plants
will start to flower outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of July instead of the middle of
August, which means these photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: plants finish in September and not
October, totally upending the photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: seed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric took their prized early
flowering CBG line and bred it to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most desired verified genetics out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including Sour Diesel, Triangle Kush,
Wedding Cake, Chem Dogs, Skittles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: These crosses all express powerful photo
period terpene profiles and THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you a great high.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTR Seeds has a new THCV line with plants
like Double Durbin and Gigantor that boast
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one THC to THCV, and people want
that THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTR seeds are very consistent,
true-growing, inbred F1s from stabilized
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred parent lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds are nearly homogenous,
and the plants should all grow the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only one phenotype in every pack,
available as diploids and triploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric's company is still
family-owned, patient and
[SPEAKER_00]: employee-centric, and partially powered by
their two acres of solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can purchase these seeds and the
entire catalog of Oregon CBD seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to gtrseeds.com today and choose
something revolutionary for your next
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor or outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is land-race specialist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Nortle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first set, we talked a lot about
what exactly land races are and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand them from different varieties
of plants that may have come into this
[SPEAKER_00]: modern world in different ways so that we
can really be precise in what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about since we are talking about a
scientific term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really great teasing those
terms apart generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now here in the second set,
I want to talk about a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: the characteristics of these plants and
why we generally all tend to respect them
[SPEAKER_00]: and why Jeff has focused so much of his
life on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeff, in your videos on your YouTube
channel, you are constantly talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: just being bowled over by the complexities
of the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the first set, we also talked a
little trash about modern polyhybrids and
[SPEAKER_00]: about how so many of them are massively
mirror scene dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to tease out a little bit more
about the experiences that you've had in
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden with unique blends of terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly, you're not going to talk
about all 300 that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to provide the listeners with a
sense snapshot of some of the experiences
[SPEAKER_00]: you've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe just pick three that were
especially unique to you and describe them
[SPEAKER_00]: to us so that we can smell it through you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as top three standout terpene
profiles from this year's garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: and again, every year we're doing
different varieties from around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ones that are super fresh in my
mind are the Cambodian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two varieties of Cambodian had the most
insane passion fruit, like just that
[SPEAKER_01]: tangy, zippy, sour, super tropical,
loud, loud, loud passion fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually went and got an actual
passion fruit, sniffed that and then
[SPEAKER_01]: sniffed one of these Mandukiri and then
also Takeo, another region in Cambodia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They smelled exactly the same,
the actual passion fruit and the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least those varieties of Cambodian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another terpene profile that you rarely
come across in sort of the modern
[SPEAKER_01]: polyhybrid genetics, but which I'm a huge
fan of are the really stinky scum and the
[SPEAKER_01]: funky rotten meat, burnt rubber,
rotten onions, just super funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times you'll find those in
the Afghan, Pakistani, we actually grew
[SPEAKER_01]: some Uzbek varieties this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those smelled like rotten,
decomposing onions and garlic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost disgusting, but at the same
time intoxicating, kind of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: truffle, black truffle effect where it's
gross, but intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those cheeses that smell like baby
diaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that smell was coming out of a human,
I'd be like, eh, but suddenly now on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plate with crackers, I'm like,
yeah, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and by the way, reminds me,
there's a really weird terpene profile
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually smells like bounce dryer
sheets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that really gnarly fab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, this is what's strange is
I'm highly allergic to a lot of synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: fragrances, especially those laundry
detergent smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just absolutely am repulsed whenever
I smell that smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, and I always said there is no
smell in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That smells like a bounce dryer sheet,
but I've actually grown some cannabis now
[SPEAKER_01]: that smells like bounce dryer sheets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: It may actually help me get through my
dryer sheet aversion by smelling it in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really strange when you smell
something in cannabis that you also exist
[SPEAKER_00]: in the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This example isn't as great as yours,
but the blueberry muffin variety from
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt seed company, it's really
startling how much it smells like the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry Jeffy cake mix, which is,
which doesn't, you know, it kind of barely
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like blueberries that are natural,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like itself, but it was so
strange to smell that variety and be all
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh my God, like, okay, this smells
blueberry, but it smells like the muffin
[SPEAKER_00]: box and those muffins themselves,
which, you know, have got a little more of
[SPEAKER_00]: a breakfast cereal vibe to them than like
a natural organic berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a fantastic variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it a long time and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet it smells like a cheap boxed
muffin mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a bizarre thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so wild, the diversity of aromas and
terpenes that this cannabis plant can
[SPEAKER_01]: carry and provide and that can just sort
of emerge from these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you start crossing plants to
whole new combinations of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's pretty mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I'm not aware of other plants that have
such a diversity of smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to ask you one more terpene
related question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to spend too much time here
because like, you know, not everybody can
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's talking about terpenes is,
is kind of challenging sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the last question I want to ask you
about this is, um, tell us, tell us about
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant that you smelled where you,
the, the, the, the terpene profile of it
[SPEAKER_00]: was, was a smell that you had never
smelled before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it blew you away because your brain
wasn't sure what to do to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably be very hard for you to
describe it to me because of that reason
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like, uh, seeing a color
you've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just, uh, yeah, you're,
your brain just can't even process that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's a number of,
uh, varieties of cannabis that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, come across in these land race,
botanical gardens we do every year that
[SPEAKER_01]: have just, it like scrambles your brain
because you've never smelled anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can't even find words to
describe it because it's such a bizarre
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, that happens quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you end up just sitting there
sniffing it because it's, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: intoxicating just to have that experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so engaging to have that first new
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We humans go for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, did want to say the other really
interesting terpene profile that you find
[SPEAKER_01]: in land races, uh, especially the African
and Southeast Asian equatorials is there's
[SPEAKER_01]: this really interesting, um, carrot,
uh, parsnip, uh, terp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, and the reason how I actually
connected those dots was my girlfriend was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually peeling parsnips and the smell
that came from those parsnips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Oh, that's that smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's that, uh, sort of antiseptic
astringent, really earthy, sweet,
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh, fresh, fresh carrot parsnip smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you'll actually see those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of African, uh, varieties as
well as, uh, uh, Thai Chiang Rai that we
[SPEAKER_01]: grew this year actually had that terp
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's, that's always a favorite
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're kind of going through your
picture album, if you will, of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of, of the plants that you love,
um, we've just did terpenes and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a very similar thing, but with
morphology now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how the plant looks, its structure,
because, um, you know, I love,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, when you go through these different
plants and I'm like, wow, these are all
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants, but they all have got so
much different visual personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you recently post a video
about one from, um, the island of St.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vincent and, and I saw it and like,
now this is a plant that would work really
[SPEAKER_00]: well where I live because it doesn't grow
big and bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of grows like it grows kind of
like straight up and down, like it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pencil skirt or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very respectful of its neighbors,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk past it without it grabbing
you like most plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I guess kind of like you did with
terpenes, maybe tell us like three of your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite morphologies, like tell us the
story of like three plants that look
[SPEAKER_00]: atypical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this year, and again, I'm just going
off this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year there's mind blowing,
uh, structures and, uh, but this year,
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge surprise was, uh, Brazil,
Amazonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, you know, thinking that was
going to be just a long lanky,
[SPEAKER_01]: wispy, tropical equatorial sativa type.
[SPEAKER_01]: This actually turned out to be super
short, super squat, bushy with big chunky
[SPEAKER_01]: thick buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grew and looked almost like an,
uh, a typical indica actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: an even bushy or stocky or squatty or,
uh, indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it has this wild, um, pina colada
terp profile going, this tropical fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, when you finally get around
to, uh, sampling it and smoking it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is super high electric, almost like
Brazil, a carnival kind of vibe,
[SPEAKER_01]: bright colors and feathers and electric
and drum beats all in a very squat bushy
[SPEAKER_01]: actually early finishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were all done, uh, by the end of
September as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but super electric sativa stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, that was, that was a big surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and also like super bulletproof as far
as pest resistance and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all that land race vigor still
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's one of the beautiful
things too about these land races is
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just so, they're so much hardier
and designed to not be high maintenance
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, so anyway, they have, yeah,
we don't even deal for the most part with
[SPEAKER_01]: botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven't seen powder mildew in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, bug pressure is pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: The aphids are still a kind of a menace.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to be around for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of indestructible,
but, um, yeah, so that's, so anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that was one, uh, structure that was
very surprising this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another, yeah, the St. Vincent as,
uh, you noticed, uh, even though we had
[SPEAKER_01]: unlimited root space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually a cannabis plant, when it has
unlimited root space, tends to the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant will then become wide and bushy
as well to mirror the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but for whatever reason, um,
the St. Vincent just shot straight
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical and only was maybe a four foot
diameter plant where a lot of ours are
[SPEAKER_01]: like eight to 10 foot diameter plants when
grown in those conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, for whatever reason, it just
really wanted to stay going vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it got probably 12 feet tall with
just really nice uniform sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: candelabra of, uh, uniform flowers going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, have not sampled that one yet,
but, uh, had all the signs that it should
[SPEAKER_01]: be a, it should be a nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's special too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like plants that look different,
you know, like even these mutant mutants
[SPEAKER_00]: that you see people put online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like mutant plants too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people are like, Oh,
that should be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it out of the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all like, okay, maybe all of
that's true, but also, isn't it cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may turn out to be a, an
advantageous adaption, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that's kind of mutants drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evolutionary change too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, let's talk a little bit about
how the morphology, um, responds to where
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants are from, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of these plants that come
your way, these land races, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves over, you know, hundreds or
thousands of years have become hot or cold
[SPEAKER_00]: adapted for the areas that they are from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, uh, I'm very willing
to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have not come into contact with as
many land races as you have, but generally
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking, my impression is, is that,
you know, equatorial plants where it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, wet and hot, they tend to be
more open airy flowers so that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, they can, uh, more easily,
uh, transpire and, you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: respirate and breathe in the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, so they dry out really quickly
after, you know, a monsoon or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas so many of the, the, you know,
the, the, the Pakistani and Afghani and
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are grown, um, you know,
near the, you know, these, these,
[SPEAKER_00]: these cold seasonal mountain reason
regions, they tend to have these like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like tighter flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my head, it's always like,
Oh, so they can conserve warmth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if that's true or not,
but, but I just like to hear your thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: after, having interacted with so many of
these plants, how do you see these
[SPEAKER_00]: morphologies, um, you know, uh,
being associated with the different parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world that they come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there definitely is, um, yeah,
the equatorial tropical sativas for the
[SPEAKER_01]: most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Share that, um, larvier area, uh,
flower structure for that exact reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're in a extremely humid moist
environment and they might even be getting
[SPEAKER_01]: rain quite often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, if it was a super compact dense
flower, they'd all implode, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: within the first week of flowering,
um, due to botrytis, uh, they'd probably
[SPEAKER_01]: mold out very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah, kind of across the board,
um, the equatorial sativas all have that
[SPEAKER_01]: looser airy, uh, structure, a lot of
times, uh, very Fox tail, like Fox tails
[SPEAKER_01]: upon Fox tails, but almost like a
Romanesque, uh, kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: fractals of like Fox tails within Fox
tails.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but you'll find those are also
crystal coated, so they may not be heavy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but every nook and cranny is coated in
crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, if you're just talking about
straight resin yield, they might actually
[SPEAKER_00]: end up being a bigger one, a better
choice, even though they're open and airy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and that's another really
interesting thing about, um, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's equatorial tropical equatorials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that pretty much across the
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the amazing thing is these plants just
don't mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just botrytis just does not happen
unless, uh, the only thing that gets the,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Achilles heel of those tropical
sativas is, uh, frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and as things start to get cold,
if you do get frost on those buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tend to, um, die very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that's, uh, so that's the only
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when they die, a lot of times you
won't get a botrytis mold, you'll just get
[SPEAKER_01]: dead spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so they're just incredibly mold
resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now with, uh, like Afghan,
Pakistan, Iranian, those varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not just hot and cold, but those are
also extremely arid environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very low humidity where, uh,
botrytis just isn't as much of a threat in
[SPEAKER_01]: those regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, the human, um, uh, intervention
with those has, has been to maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get more yield with a chunkier,
heavier bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can push it without botrytis,
you know, there, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the problem is when you bring a super
dense chunk Afghan, all of a sudden into
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Cruz, coastal wet, foggy
environment, that's just a recipe for,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, botrytis explosions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, and see that quite a lot of
people have that experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're fortunate where we're growing,
we're behind a mountain range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that catches the Marine layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're actually pretty arid in our
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can actually pull off these,
um, uh, Afghan, Pakistani.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty obvious from your Instagram
that you live in a special bio region
[SPEAKER_00]: because seeing all these different plants
from all these different regions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, all growing and finishing,
like I've, I've sworn at my phone before
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, how the hell is he growing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause like I live at the other
end, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I live Pacific Northwest on an Island,
you know, 50 feet from crashing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Marine and salty, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I live a terrible place to grow
myself, but where you are, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, you know, best possible
combination of attributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's San Lorenzo Valley in Santa
Cruz mountains has a long, long,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, cannabis history and it turns out it's
a real nice, uh, little micro climate
[SPEAKER_01]: that, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say it's, it's blocked off from the Marine
layer, even though we're down in a valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so you don't necessarily have to be
super high elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but, uh, but we're behind a mountain,
uh, empire grade that actually catches
[SPEAKER_01]: that whole Marine layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just don't get that coastal fog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing I want to talk about is
the, the unique cultivation demands of
[SPEAKER_00]: land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of fits in perfectly with
the weather conversation that we're having
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, I'm sure lots of people
who are listening like me are being
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired by what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all like, I want to grow land
races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, um, uh, have you, you know,
from, from growing so many year over a
[SPEAKER_00]: year, um, have you noticed any cultivation
demands or best practices, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: for land races?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, I imagine to a certain
degree, they are finicky, uh, to us who
[SPEAKER_00]: are used to kind of growing all of the
same plant because, because these,
[SPEAKER_00]: these, these modern plants that we've
talked about earlier are, are very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but then you're growing all these
weirdo plants, which of course are land
[SPEAKER_00]: races and they're not weirdo, but like
they are, if you're a cultivator who has
[SPEAKER_00]: never grown them before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's, let's hear a little bit
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm sure that you have run into some
unexpected growing needs that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of these varieties have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, here's, here's the very good
news about land race is, um, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually developed to be low maintenance
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so a real finicky high maintenance
like OG cush, you know, that, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's going to have powder mildew
and all this, uh, not to get back into the
[SPEAKER_01]: dog thing, but, um, but it's kind of like,
you don't have to worry about with the
[SPEAKER_01]: land race, like the hip dysplasia and all
this like kind of inbred problems with,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, susceptibilities to disease and,
uh, molds and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it turns out actually with the hop
latent viroid, uh, most land races,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they can still get it,
but don't seem to be affected,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, as negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Negatively as some of these poly hybrids
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, so it's actually, yes,
all the land races and we're growing them
[SPEAKER_01]: from all around the world from totally
different regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but because they're such hardy,
uh, plants that are designed to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, thrive without a ton of human,
uh, catering and pandering to the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and pampering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they all do pretty, they have a,
they all seem to have a high tolerance to
[SPEAKER_01]: disease molds and pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I actually think they're easier to
grow than, uh, most of the modern poly
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids that tend to have sort of genetic
disease built in these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've, they've actually, yeah,
they've gone for potency and who cares
[SPEAKER_01]: about, and, and when people say,
oh, it's a challenging strain or really
[SPEAKER_01]: finicky strain, there's another way you
could say is that's kind of crap genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a massively disease prone
plant, that might actually be kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: crappy genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one wants to, yeah, be growing,
unless you're doing some adoptive foster
[SPEAKER_01]: thing for sickly plants or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why, why would you want to grow plants
that you have to spray chemicals all over
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: To fend off diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about just getting genetics that
naturally fend off diseases?
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you, do you find that, um,
it takes some time with these varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: for you to figure out their like basic
needs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can imagine that these different
plants from different places have got like
[SPEAKER_00]: different water requirements and
different, um, you know, uh, food
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I can totally see where you
might think that, but, uh, here's,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's how, we grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we, we don't actually really feed
throughout the entire year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we focus on and we grow in a hugel
culture environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, so where, and what we do is we
build a really super nutrient dense,
[SPEAKER_01]: super rich living soil in the off season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the time we plop that plant in
that soil come, uh, uh, June, May or June,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't actually feed those plants
throughout the whole year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's, what we're doing is we
provide an all you can eat buffet of
[SPEAKER_01]: compost and organic nutrients that,
uh, along with all the, uh, breaking down,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, forest debris, uh, sticks,
leaves, uh, chunks of logs and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now you have all the mycelium
that's just thriving in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like the plant,
um, can pick and choose what it wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got an all you can eat buffet and
everything's there at its root tips,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to absorb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that's, that's how we actually
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We supercharge and get really living,
great, powerful living soil, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the beginning of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plants just kind of adapt to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're, not at all running around going,
oh, this, these Brazilians need some
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus or this needs magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we don't do that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the only time is maybe some of these
longer flowering plants that get super,
[SPEAKER_01]: super huge, uh, may just need a little bit
of, uh, nitrogen later in the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they start, if they've gobbled up all
the, uh, nitrogen, a lot of times we'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: that with just a simple, like fish
emulsion, compost tea, uh, to just balance
[SPEAKER_01]: them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but no, there's these are not,
um, yeah, they, they all basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're, they're all growing in the exact
same soil with the same nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: same watering and they kind of,
and they just kind of adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when, when you're new to a land race
and you don't know whether or not it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be, you know, a four foot wide or
a 10 foot wide plant, do you just give all
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants the same amount of space and
let them express themselves?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're in a fixed, we installed these
hexagon, uh, shaped planter boxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not moving your grid every year
or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and we gave them a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we designed the garden, uh,
for humans to be wandering around.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a row crop yielding industrial
garden by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's actually a living art exhibit
of, uh, cannabis genetics from around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cool just growing, but then they
make it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sounds like a pleasure garden,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we, we started this and we started
having a, visitors out and it was just so
[SPEAKER_01]: much fun, but this was pre COVID and then
COVID hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we've kind of taken a break
from having visitors out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then the hop late and by Roy had
me really freaked out until now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a much better understanding of the
risk, um, and such, and we're not in a
[SPEAKER_01]: high risk, uh, of humans visiting and like
transmitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but anyway, yeah, the garden's
designed to actually, for humans to wander
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, where each box actually has plenty of
space in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually, if you're wandering
around, socializing, smoking, and you
[SPEAKER_01]: resonate with a particular plant,
you can then walk all the way around the
[SPEAKER_01]: perimeter of that plant, see it from all
angles, uh, and, and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, yeah, we give the plants lots
of space because we kind of see each one
[SPEAKER_01]: as like a, a work of art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and we want to give it its,
its space.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, how do you find that these,
and like, I recognize that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, so you may not have had to done
a lot of this, but I bet you still have an
[SPEAKER_00]: educated opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how, how do these land races that
have never, um, you know, been cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: by present growers, how do they respond to
things like training and scragging and
[SPEAKER_00]: like kind of like human dominance?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, well, that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, philosophically, I, I don't see
my relationship with the plant as where
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to dominate and squeeze out and
maximize and exploit every molecule of
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant to pump out more buds for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we, we don't top, we don't leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't train.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we're just, each one of these seeds is
a mystery and we want to see what this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant story is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually step back and just let the
plant do its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so we, again, we don't even leaf these
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and what, what you'll find though,
when you let a plant just go natural,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you kind of get a Christmas tree type
shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it may be like, Hey, how to,
but how does light get into the inner
[SPEAKER_01]: buds?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the answer is as, as the buds get
heavier on the tips of the branches,
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually opens the plant up as the
gravity pulls down those branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now all of a sudden the whole length of
that branch is now sort of the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is almost blooming like a flower and
opening up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now all of a sudden the sun can get in
to those inner buds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but then we also do, um, cause some of
these plants are, you know, 12 feet tall,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 feet diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so we don't harvest the entire plant
all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do like a layered harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just take the top right buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that also allows the sun to now
penetrate further into the plant and let
[SPEAKER_01]: those under buds develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll, we'll do three or four harvests
off the same plant, uh, while at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time, just watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we don't, we don't do, we've given
up on all the human manipulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the one thing we do though,
I should know is as far as you do have to
[SPEAKER_01]: support the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we just put four redwood posts,
uh, creating an out outer box of posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we take a organic hemp bakers
twine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually food grade hemp twine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just run that twine sort of like a
big spider web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around, uh, the plant to support its
branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, but that's, that's all we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when we come back, we're going to be
talking a little bit about breeding land
[SPEAKER_00]: races and a little bit more about,
uh, preserving land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is land race
specialist, Jeff Nordahl.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis seed market is filled with
big name and hype breeders fighting to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And occasionally you discover a breeder
who is breeding because it is the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing they care to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would be doing it even if they
never made a dime.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my friend, Craig Hartzah,
who makes seeds as magnetic genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craig comes from five generations of
farmers and is earning his master's degree
[SPEAKER_00]: in horticulture right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been growing cannabis for 15 years
and been breeding for nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't sold many seeds because he
really isn't a sales guy, but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: personally been growing his seeds for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I can always rely on his seeds
to germinate, thrive, and smell and taste
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggested to Craig that he should
probably sell some seeds and asked if he
[SPEAKER_00]: had enough stockpiled to bother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much to my shock, he was sitting on five
full menus and cold storage that he
[SPEAKER_00]: produced in the last two years and hadn't
even tried to sell any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was simply too busy breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we, his friends convinced him to
make his damn seeds available to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they are for the first time
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can now buy magnetic genetic seeds at
Neptune seed bank and on strainly.io.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neptune seed bank has just picked up
magnetic genetics for a trial to gauge
[SPEAKER_00]: your interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are carrying three strains from his
mean mug, prominence, and turpinado menus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are exclusive to Neptune.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy way to score his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pick up those menus plus his
hillbilly skunk and candy breath crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: and more on his profile page on strainly
.io.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want very affordable seeds that are
exceptional quality with rare turpinado
[SPEAKER_00]: and turpinado profiles from a good guy,
go to Neptuneseedbank.com or strainly.io.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is fun to buy the hype thing
from the brand you admire, but when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to buy the strain you'll love from
an obscure mad scientist, you're ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: magnetic genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magneticgenetics.org and on Instagram,
magneticgenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert has the beneficial insects,
mites and nematodes, microbials,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky cards, and air distribution units
you need to partner with nature to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_00]: from chemical sprays towards clean and
natural solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1967, Copert has assisted growers in
identifying pests and devising reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions while providing healthy insects
and mites that will protect your yield.

good for health and good for business and
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is ready to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit Copert.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options in who to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_00]: ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend Gaslamp Seeds to my friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners who are looking for a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably already know Gaslamp Seeds as
HEMBRA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: HEMBRA recently changed their name to
Gaslamp Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp Seeds is not just another seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp is a female-operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: With over 60 breeders and over 1,000
strains to choose from, you will certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: find something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp Seeds has something for everyone
with over 650 feminized strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 regular varieties, and over 200
autoflowers to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Names you know you can trust, like
Compound Genetics, Humboldt Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Owl, In-House, FastBuds,
Gnome Automatics, and Ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money but have no
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited Gaslamp to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_00]: about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have A-plus customer service with
lightning-fast response times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will
give you
[SPEAKER_00]: an additional set of Gaslamp-provided
freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an extra $30 in free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy seeds from good folks who will send
you great seeds reliably every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit gaslampseeds.com today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Gaslamp Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is land race
specialist, Jeff Nordahl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are at the big finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the first set, we figured out
what the hell land races are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the second set, we talked about
why we have all fallen in love with them
[SPEAKER_00]: and why anytime the flower is available,
serious weed heads are on it, like catnip,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know that that is the special
rare, rare thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we just don't have as much access to
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're beloved for good reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this last set, we're going to talk a
little bit about breeding with land races
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a little bit about preserving
land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeff, we've already touched on breeding
a little bit earlier in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's a two-sided coin,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like on one side, breeding with land races
is exhilarating because we like the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of taking whatever our favorite modern
strain is and then breeding it to a land
[SPEAKER_00]: race strain to perhaps increase its vigor
or increase its resistance to pests or to
[SPEAKER_00]: grab some of those old school land race
terpene profiles, whatever it is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or actually the other way, try to breed a
land race to a modern plant to cut down on
[SPEAKER_00]: how many weeks it takes to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of reasons that we may
want to breed with a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the flip side of that also is that
every time we breed a land race,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is less of that land race that exists
in its pure form for us to preserve for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal applications or for just
enjoying that land race in and of its own
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just like to hear you speak to
that about are you crossing land races to
[SPEAKER_00]: modern hybrids?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are your thoughts about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there's two things going on when
you're sort of deciding to work with land
[SPEAKER_01]: race plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's two goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's preservation, so backing it up,
so realizing that these are possibly at
[SPEAKER_01]: risk of going extinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do a seed re-up or just an in-line
breed where you're just preserving that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular line of land race for
preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you can go off and start playing
around and experimenting and doing all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of crosses and genetic hybrid work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are both totally valid things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just go full-blown hybrid,
and then lose your... Again, with the dog
[SPEAKER_01]: breed thing, you can't really take the
doodle out of the Doberman Pinscher once
[SPEAKER_01]: it goes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've bred that land race,
all those attributes are all mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it would take lots of generations to
try and back it out to get back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: original variety or at least close to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preservation going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now at my stage in my cannabis
adventures is we're popping new seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: every year, total mystery seeds from these
different regions of the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: even sometimes going back in time to the
80s, 70s, 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're observing those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now we're focused on preserving
those genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do that really well, you can't just
go skipping down into your garden with...
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to pollinate,
let's say a Vietnamese plant, you may have
[SPEAKER_01]: your male Vietnamese from that same seed
batch or hopefully like three,
[SPEAKER_01]: four or five males.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting more genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, by the way, that's another thing
you're trying to do with your land race
[SPEAKER_01]: seed backups, your genetic backups is your
not doing a lot of selection right then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're actually trying to get the broadest
gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to use as many females and as
many males from that variety as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when you make, let's say a
thousand seeds, you're trying to capture
[SPEAKER_01]: as much genetic diversity in that seed
backup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are just not primary colors,
but these are your foundation building
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks of cannabis breeding that you want
to keep pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once you have those locked in and
you have those seeds where you're saving
[SPEAKER_01]: them in a good environment that they're
going to last 10 years plus, still be
[SPEAKER_01]: viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have the freedom to go start
making crosses and hybrids where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to improve things or adapt things
for like here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may absolutely love
[SPEAKER_01]: the effect, the high that you got from a
plant from Laos, but it's a 16 week
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult to grow that outdoors
here in California before the storms come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and just beat the crap out of the plant
and it may even kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may say, hey, I want that Laos
effect, but in a plant that finishes in
[SPEAKER_01]: mid-October, so then you have to start
pondering what would be the least
[SPEAKER_01]: intrusive early finishing plant that might
carry all the Laos effects with it on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's totally cool, totally fair game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's disrespecting any
cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's culturally
appropriating as long as you're crediting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wider global cannabis community and
then are transparent with how you created
[SPEAKER_01]: that variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like say, yeah, if a Thai and a Laos plant
in an Afghan went together, document that
[SPEAKER_01]: and let people know that's where that
plant came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are its lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I think that's respectful as well to
the origins and the farmers who created
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's totally cool and fair game,
but the ethical short-sighted blunder
[SPEAKER_01]: would be to immediately, at least this is
my opinion, just immediately start making
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid crosses without backing up and
preserving that original land race that
[SPEAKER_01]: may have taken hundreds if not thousands
of years to create that unique genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say back it up, would that just
be a simple open pollination like in a
[SPEAKER_00]: tent or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're not losing the pollen into
other plants, but you're just letting them
[SPEAKER_00]: all make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of rambled on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing is if you're dealing with a
lot of varieties of pure lines of land
[SPEAKER_01]: race, you can't be sloppy with your
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bring pollen down into your garden
and potentially have that pollen drift
[SPEAKER_01]: onto other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the technique that I use that works
well, but I'm open to other ideas if other
[SPEAKER_01]: people have come up with other techniques
that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, what I do is we grow the land race
plants out in our land race botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you get the big 10,
12, 15, foot tall plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before those plants go into flower,
I label each one of those plants with its
[SPEAKER_01]: variety plus its phenome number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be Mexico, Jalisco,
three out of four Jalisco plants we're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one's number three phenome,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll take cuttings off that number
three Jalisco plant, take those cuttings
[SPEAKER_01]: to my other property, root those cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I have very small versions of that
plant that are now that are now I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping them in like a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when I need to go isolate them for
pollinating, I can easily just move them
[SPEAKER_01]: around my property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the males I keep in a separate
area and then we even isolate our males.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a time to make sure some other plants
pollen is not drifting onto that male
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know we're getting just that pure
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that pollen gets taken to that
very isolated cluster of let's say Jalisco
[SPEAKER_01]: number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're doing let's say Jalisco,
if we had four plants, I would then put
[SPEAKER_01]: Jalisco one, two, three and four cuttings
all in one area, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got the cuttings all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're now in flower mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hopefully we'll have three,
four Jalisco males and I'll take all that
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen from all four of those males and
then go evenly distribute that over all
[SPEAKER_01]: the cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I totally follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really liked the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked the idea that you take the
cuttings early on when the plant is in
[SPEAKER_00]: your main garden or in veg and then you
just move them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because honestly, before you explained
that you had the second property,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to picture you safely
pollinating these plants in your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: with all 300 land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, that sounds like hell,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds impossible to succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you get pollen drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you kind of have to treat pollen
like Ebola.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gets everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will find a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool thing that most people know,
though, is with pollen, water will
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately render it non-viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another way to get a dirty
hippie to shower a lot, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put him in charge of the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take 10 showers a day, if not more,
you know, when I'm in the middle of doing
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do kind of an open pollination,
but we do it on just a very small,
[SPEAKER_01]: with small little cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my understanding, at least,
is that those cuttings from those original
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are the exact same genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those seeds will be true to that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes it, you have a lot more
agility and easily being able to isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: and move transport plants around for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to continue down this preserving
path that we've started on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot more people are thinking
about land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm going to talk about two levels
of magnitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, people are very interested in
land races because, especially if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseurs, because so much of modern
cannabis tastes the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interest in land race is
increasing, and they are seen as elite and
[SPEAKER_00]: very desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, you know, as as kind of like
global travel for cannabis people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, continues to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with the technological ways to
tell friends about them, we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences like, like recently,
a lot of people watched on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, Kevin Jodry and Danny
Montero and, and IG land race genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they put together a group of people
and all went to Pakistan, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, like, I was I was riveted by those
videos of, of like people who I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and my friends who are like suddenly in
Pakistan, places where I normally only see
[SPEAKER_00]: represented in like war and terrorism
movies, you know, and suddenly they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: there, like wearing beards, you know,
in Pakistan, and interacting with the
[SPEAKER_00]: locals and checking out their hash and
checking out their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was all like, wow, this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like I wasn't, you know,
on this trip, but I feel like I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of these experiences from the trip,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just increases the meaning and
value of land race seeds and genetics in
[SPEAKER_00]: my overall head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that there's more and more
people who are just interested in land
[SPEAKER_00]: races, which is good, of course,
because, you know, the the the the land
[SPEAKER_00]: race origin areas, like Thailand,
specifically, are starting to get like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of our people are bringing seeds
there and developing them in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so their natural land race is
getting diluted, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this is to set up this question
that, you know, I can see that land races
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to become increasingly popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet we already are trying to preserve
them for medicinal reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to hear you speak to the idea of
preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And A, how do you think that land races
are effectively preserved?
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, do you think there's any chance in
hell that we're not actually going to
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually lose all the land races,
because they are a set number today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that number is likely just probably
going to continue to decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe maybe I've got an, you know,
an especially jaded view of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that's a big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just gonna like hand you the mic and
hear what your thoughts are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the extinction through
hybridization is incredibly real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, a lot of people are sounding the
alarm, like, hey, we really need to start
[SPEAKER_01]: backing these up before they all go
extinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as these land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and yeah, so till yes, that is really
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the extinction is a real concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full stops.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it's not just like pollen drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually, you know, folks,
we're gonna get to a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we we've romanticized here in the
US, we may romanticize this little
[SPEAKER_01]: secluded fantasy village.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in the Himalayas, you hike up to
anything, you're going to find this like
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing weed that's grown by monks or
something, or the whole village like grows
[SPEAKER_01]: his magical weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you take this trek up there and you
get up there and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, we got cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Coca Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, yeah, we're we're
growing gelato and diesel and OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, that's the kind of cookies that
you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's I thought you know,
Western foods, you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it may be that they're like
blasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, no, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they may be actually blasting
Snoop Dogg and growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: California strains up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we of course, romanticize that they're
supposed to stay isolated and unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: When in reality, they want to,
they want to grow the height too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to integrate and they they're
watching stuff in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Amsterdam thinking that's that's really
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would they want to grow grow their
grandfather's old larvae weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, these are just like cultural
phenomena and things that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's no judgment or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to realize that that's this.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there seems to be some value in
preserving these genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these genetics could go back
hundreds, if not thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're kind of, in a way,
almost like cultural biographies or even
[SPEAKER_01]: autobiographies from the actual breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like antique art is too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and they're infusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a plant, but it's also infused
with culture's values and their stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a way, it's almost like they're part
of their cultural story too, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like their food and their seasonings
and dishes and dance and religion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis is a reflection of those
values and aesthetics that they've chosen
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd just be a super bummer to have
those disappear and just get hybridized or
[SPEAKER_01]: such.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, once some of these
cultures also may go through like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the hype phase, there may be in
like 20 years, all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_01]: a re-interest in their heritage genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if someone wasn't backing this stuff
up, you know, it may be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be that they actually have to
look outside to other people who happen to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep those genetics, you know,
from their trip that they took to that
[SPEAKER_01]: region.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been keeping them in their sock
drawer for the last 20 years, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there just seems, it doesn't seem to be
negative in any way by backing up and
[SPEAKER_01]: preserving these genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just seems like a good long view
strategy that there is value in keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: these genetics around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And preserving them, if nothing more,
for just historical purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd argue there's probably tons of
medicinal compounds and terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: combinations and such that may actually
have some real medicinal value going into
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just the effects and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of incentive and reason
that these genetics really should be
[SPEAKER_01]: backed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lots of different people around the
world are playing different parts,
[SPEAKER_01]: either by gathering and hunting these
seeds and actually just collecting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other people are sort of
distributing them as hubs, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for people who are interested in accessing
these genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that we've sort of toyed around
with here in Santa Cruz and something that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd really like to be a part of and even
potentially work with a larger
[SPEAKER_01]: organization who has like grant money and
such.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to actually put together an actual
cannabis seed bank, like a public domain
[SPEAKER_01]: seed bank to try and back up especially as
far as land race genetics, try and back up
[SPEAKER_01]: and preserve as much of those genetics as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, very important philosophically,
that would be public domain where everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: would have access to these.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no proprietary ownership of any of
these genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd be preserving them for their own
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't mean like a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people use seed bank now very often
as just like a seed bank store or a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank distributor where there's the profit
motive primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about a more classical seed
bank, like those of us who save seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're making a library.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like the seed preservation that's
going on in Norway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That big building that unsurprisingly
flooded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those kind of seed banks and like here
you see UCSC, University of California,
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Cruz, did something else which was
the human genome project where they map
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire human genome and then put that
in the public domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were in a race with some of the
pharmaceutical companies and researchers
[SPEAKER_01]: who wanted that information to be
proprietary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But UCSC and our sort of hippie for the
community sort of vibes, at least UCSC
[SPEAKER_01]: decided to put that all in the public
domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the human genome project where
anyone can actually access that
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd like to see in that spirit
something with a cannabis seed bank or
[SPEAKER_01]: library or archive where everyone would
have equal access to all those genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be a procedure obviously to get
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, where they're available to
everyone because we kind of come from the
[SPEAKER_01]: philosophy that humans did not create
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from the universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so who are we to claim ownership?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is here for the people and the
magic of it is connecting more people in a
[SPEAKER_01]: positive way with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that has the potential to actually
shift things in a positive trajectory for
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're going to start playing these
ownership proprietary exclusive commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar chasing games with a plant that
generally when you consume it a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times has the opposite effect or opposite
message.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely in the spirit of just
the cannabis experience is making things
[SPEAKER_01]: available to everyone equal access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Share the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that that's a great place to
stop on that message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Jeff, I want to first thank you for
I know your time is valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time of year is really busy as
you work through your plants coming down
[SPEAKER_00]: and curing and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thank you for making time for us,
number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then number two, I'm really grateful
for you as your personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're such a chipper, easy to like guy on
your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is exactly how you showed up
authentically here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine there's anybody who's been
listening to the show who wouldn't A,
[SPEAKER_00]: like to hear you talk more and then B,
wouldn't enjoy sitting down for lunch and
[SPEAKER_00]: a chat on your deck with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just you're such an amiable dude
with like such a vast experience on this
[SPEAKER_00]: very particular topic that we all get
giddy about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for coming onto shaping fire
and sharing with us your experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's been a been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, in some point in the future,
our plan is to actually have people come
[SPEAKER_01]: out and visit our our property so we can
just sit there and geek out and nerd out
[SPEAKER_01]: and stand there and all staring at plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that that is the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with COVID and everything,
it made it tough to have visitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those videos that you've watched really
is coming from that intent is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to share, share these plants with
others and inspire others to take a closer
[SPEAKER_01]: look and maybe delve in to the unlimited,
infinitely fan amazing land race world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So So in wrapping up, dear listener,
if you would like to keep tabs on Jeff and
[SPEAKER_00]: his land race amusement park that he runs,
I recommend at the top of the list,
[SPEAKER_00]: you follow him the way I do on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Jade nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: All one word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that that is an absolute have to if
you want to know more about Jeff and his
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a an expert in the acid forms of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: He even holds U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: patents, which is not something that we
was on the topic today, but he's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can find out more about that aspect
of his goodwill.
[SPEAKER_00]: At his at his website, which is Jade
nectar dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, if you want to see
sometimes longer forms of the videos that
[SPEAKER_00]: are on Instagram, you can also search Jade
nectar on YouTube first for some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: longer forms of the videos.
