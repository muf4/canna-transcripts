[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, Jeff, thank you so much for
taking a couple minutes away from IndoExpo
[SPEAKER_02]: to come over and talk to me about the Hash
Star System.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I've just recently gotten
into Hash a lot more than I used to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm starting to learn how the Star
System works in real life now,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you see stuff, it's really a
lot different than hearing the Star System
[SPEAKER_02]: just, like, in theory, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, so I'm talking with Jeff about
it, and he starts giving me all these
[SPEAKER_02]: details about, like, where it came from
and stuff, and I'm like, oh, hold on,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, we need to go and get in front of a
camera and do this straight up,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm sure that I'm not the only
person who has not heard this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, Jeff, so I'm just going to give
you the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did the Hash Star System come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the Star System came from the
Bizarre Brothers down in Oakland,
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, I want to say,
like, 2010 was when it started up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they had was a Measure Z club,
and a Measure Z club was a place that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could go to, and in private, you could
have a club where you're consuming
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and you're selling cannabis in
Oakland, and it was the lowest enforceable
[SPEAKER_01]: priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Measure Z made cannabis consumption the
lowest enforceable priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys opened up the Bizarre,
and at the Bizarre, you know, they were
[SPEAKER_01]: selling Hash, and it really kind of just
had one price at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all Hash was the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: All Hash, you know, whether it's just,
you know, the lowest quality Keef Tumble
[SPEAKER_01]: forever, you know, or it's that really,
really nice Bubble Hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all the same price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they said, no, this is not how it
should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to have a quality-based rating
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they came up with the Star Rating
System.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a one through six Star Ratings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, so do we want to plug who those
humans are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, you know, my buddy Space and
my buddy Corpy were really the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of solidified that Star Rating
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to get that history, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I mean, just amazing
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got real love for Hash,
have been making Hash for many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many years, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space and I started making Hash probably
right around the same time and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, traveled down the West Coast
with Bubble Bags, like 2000 and 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like really early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they've got this club and all this
stuff is being sold the same, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so basically, so here, I'll just
break into what the Star Rating System is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a one through six,
one being the lowest, six being the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one Star, and so let me just preface
this with everything is based on a pressed
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of Hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take the Hash and you press it with
heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, just mild, mild heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't mean like a rosin presser.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just like your hand, you know,
or maybe a little bit warmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could hold it up to like in front of
your heater or something like that for
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit to warm it up and press
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's smoked on a stainless steel
screen in a pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how all of this is rated and
it's based on the melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one Star is no melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not press together with heat and
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning it's just falling apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just falls apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing binding it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly just green plant material,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe a lot of stock,
very little resin to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of the lowest end of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably press that with like a
jack press or something like that and get
[SPEAKER_01]: it into a puck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a two Star easily presses with
heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have it pressed
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you smoke that on a screen,
it's going to basically retain whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: shape it is that it's in when you put it
onto the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you light it up and just really gently
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might see a little sheen or maybe a
tiny little bit of melting bubble to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it doesn't really move.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays in that same shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have like a little ball and then I'd
light it and it kind of burns down and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it's still like a little ball of ash
at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same exact shape in the end, but just ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because all that ash is the
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The oil melts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you have a three Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: And three Star is really getting into,
you know, where you have a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: higher quality hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than just the average hash at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And three Star will go from whatever shape
it's in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will boil into basically a lump.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have it in a flat kind of sheet
that you've pressed out, it'll kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It leaves kind of this haystack formation
of ash in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then four Star will melt down into a
puddle and leave kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll come from wherever it's at rapidly
boiling all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's bubbles, you know, clear domes
everywhere, hopefully if it's nice dry
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will come down to an even flat bit
of ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like the two Star where there's like a
ton of ash there, but just like a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: little even amount of ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no haystack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't kind of melt and then kind of
clump together before it was able to go
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had spent all of its oil on a three
Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the four Star has more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's able to kind of get out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And four Star is actually the first Star
that I would ever attempt to dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now granted, you've got a lot of plant
material still left in a four Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not really the best thing to
be dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to want to be cleaning
afterwards for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be, you're going to
be using several Q-tips to clean out your
[SPEAKER_01]: banger for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, then we can go to a five Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five Star it melts down and it does this
unique thing that where it creates one big
[SPEAKER_01]: clear dome and it pushes any contaminant
that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the things that aren't melting in your
bubble hash, it pushes them out to the
[SPEAKER_01]: edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outer ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of that clear dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the screen in the center of the clear
dome is visible because there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminant on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just this outer ring of
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you smoke that down, that's what
you're left with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're left with a visible screen with an
outer ring of contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that dabs fairly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still has that contaminant, but you know,
it's a lot better to dab five Star than
[SPEAKER_01]: four Star for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can go a little bit warmer
and not, not have to worry about burning
[SPEAKER_01]: as much kind of cellulose in your dab,
which is, you know, four Star could be
[SPEAKER_01]: tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be really low, low temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that leads us to six Star and six
Star will just rapidly melt down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's boiling like crazy and it just melts
through the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's little to no residue kind of
in like different spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is residue, it's not like all
collected up anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kind of like, you know,
just a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was even there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's really the Holy grail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, back in the day when the
Star system was created, six Star was not
[SPEAKER_01]: a thing that was had every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today you can get six Star all the time,
uh, because you know, hash makers have
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced and, and, uh, they've,
they've really, um, stepped up their game
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to make everything into a six
Star, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take, uh, you know,
and do, um, fresh frozen material and up
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but back in the day, it was like the
unicorn, the six Star was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd get one and that was, and then you
wouldn't have another one for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had to be that right variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, first question is, is,
so, um, it can, can, can hash degrade?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can it, can it, like when it was made,
it was this particular Star, but because
[SPEAKER_02]: of age or it wasn't taken care of right or
what, can it slide down the scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, hash degrades over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it becomes less potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a four Star, may become a three or a
three and a half Star potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I actually have some hash that,
uh, that I just found, um, that was
[SPEAKER_01]: stashed from like, man, it must've been
2000, I don't know, maybe 2012,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a four Star unintentionally
cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a four Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says it on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you smoke it, I would actually
judge it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still today is a four Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and, uh, it, it just doesn't
have the flavor anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the Terps are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bet when, when it was rated a four
Star, it was probably a high four Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's like a, you know,
just a four Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a solid four Star, but you know,
that's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the, the star system, as we described
it, it's all about physicality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing about flavor or taste or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's, that was to give
everybody an even playing field that they
[SPEAKER_01]: could, uh, could, you know, work with,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So theoretically you could have a five or
six Star that actually doesn't taste very
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does incredible things in the pipe,
but it actually is kind of not so tasty if
[SPEAKER_02]: it was handled wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so, you know, hash is,
is like, you know, kind of two family
[SPEAKER_02]: trees at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the people who are pressing them
together and making temple balls and
[SPEAKER_02]: bricks and funds like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I also, you know, more often I am
getting to take this like blonde,
[SPEAKER_02]: not oxidized sandy stuff that folks are
making freeze dried and then they're
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting it in the, yeah, they're,
they're, they're doing live frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh frozen and freeze dried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you get this like sandy magic
stuff and you're like, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's impressive to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to make it in a cold room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resin doesn't stick together while
you're collecting it, get it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, so where does that fall in
those scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I mean, so, so,
so I, I feel like a lot of that stuff's
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting the six star, you know,
and, um, and you know, a lot of that
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really good stuff isn't even being
smoked as hash anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being pressed into rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, man, I would dab either the rosin
or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I love hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely my favorite thing to dab
at the moment, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but yeah, it's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's, there's a lot of really good
hash out there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so I was talking about,
uh, the star system with my buddy the
[SPEAKER_02]: other day and I told him I was going to
interview you when, when we came here to
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado and, um, and he's like,
oh, you know, I've, I've even heard about
[SPEAKER_02]: seven and eight star now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the story?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a next level that's coming along?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so like, um, so we've got the six star
that's solidified as the ceiling for
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that is the best that you can do is
seven, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so six, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best thing you can do is six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it started, um, right around the time
when rosin, uh, came, came around and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was at the same time when, uh,
people were introducing Terps into
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless extracts and things like that,
you know, cannabis derived terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, uh, uh, blue river terpenes and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I remember, uh, Horatio on hash church
said, you know, the seventh star or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, you know,
he was, he was like, oh, this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: seventh star.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's, it's kind of like,
um, it's a playoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The star system being like, no,
this is better than that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people, they call their
rosin seven star, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's, it's, you know, because
you've removed the waxy trichome outer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've removed the non-cannabinoid and,
uh, non-terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is resin only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've removed any cellulose, cellulose
you've removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like you, you kind of, just
described two different forks in the road,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the, the, you know, pressing it into
hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty good case for a seven
star.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that you took six star and you
removed the outside of the trichome and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're left with just the inside of the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather somebody say this is raw
hash rosin made from this star like six
[SPEAKER_01]: star or we make a lot of hash rosin from
four star.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we, we do all dry trim
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do the fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's harder to hit those higher
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we do, you know, get a four star,
we'll press it up, you know, some good
[SPEAKER_01]: hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other, the other side though,
where you're, where you're adding
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That are not indigenous to that particular
run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like, like adding blue river or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like that's almost like a different
product to me, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as you're moving up, you're actually
removing things from your hash experience,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, first you're getting rid of the,
the, the, the plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you go up, then you're getting
rid of ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're getting rid of,
if there's even anything in the pipe when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're done, but then adding, you know,
even though not to dis on that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just to say it seems like a different
product now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that was really just,
you know, the evolution of hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were, we're now taking this hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got this, you know, really nice kind
of base.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a great, hash pressing into
rosin and then people adding terps into
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a further, further step of
alchemy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do I really like super high terp
stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's why I actually like hash rosin
is because hash rosin versus flour rosin,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Has way less terpene content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a great terpene content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong, but it's got way less.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less harsh on my asthmatic lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just easier for me to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also in flour rosin, you have
lipids that are contained within the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material that aren't contained within the
resin heads, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all these lipids and there's
all these terpene glands that you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: extract into hashish because you're just,
you're looking for the bulbous trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're freezing it and removing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's what you get in bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you press the flour rosin,
it's really an expression of that entire
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you really saying that if you press
the flour, you're actually getting a
[SPEAKER_02]: larger and maybe more intense terpene
profile than if you just press the hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got test results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can show you to prove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my follow up to that would be,
are there terpenes that we want in the
[SPEAKER_02]: flour that are that are not in the hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought that it, once you removed
the hash and you made the, the hash rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: that you'd get, any, any taste that you'd
be leaving behind is any kind of grassy
[SPEAKER_02]: plant material taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by using, doing the hash rosin,
you're getting the pure, pure of all the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes you wanted, but you're,
it sounds like you're saying that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving some in the flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're leaving a bunch in the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so a really interesting thing take,
I don't know if you have access to a still
[SPEAKER_01]: for essential oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your spent hash material,
your sugar leaf that you've, you've
[SPEAKER_01]: processed, you've done all your,
how many runs you're going to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that spent material and steam distill
it and check out the amount of terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: that you get from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and it's, it's very similar to
what you would get if you were to just
[SPEAKER_01]: steam distill the material before you ran
it for bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so what, what happens is you've
got terpenes and cannabinoids and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really you've got a large
concentration of cannabinoids and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: these terpenes and there's phenols,
there's all kinds of things in the resin
[SPEAKER_01]: head, but they're kind of in this
solidified thing, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: when the plant gets rubbed up on it's,
it's going to release it, but down below
[SPEAKER_01]: that on the surface of the plant material,
there's different glands that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like 10 micron in size and they
don't produce cannabinoids, but they do
[SPEAKER_01]: produce lipids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, the terpenes are volatized out
of them constantly where the resin head,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of sealed for the most part,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so that's where the terpenes that
the plant's using for what, whatever it's
[SPEAKER_01]: producing these terpenes for, you know,
that that's where they're coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, but that same, pretty much
the same profile is contained within the
[SPEAKER_01]: resin head of the, of the tricone,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if it's like losing out on
it, um, or just not getting it and
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoying the hashish for what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost just like a different way to
serve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What came to my mind was like sushi versus
sashimi, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like maybe you want the whole flower,
Rasen, but sometimes maybe you just want
[SPEAKER_02]: the topping.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, so like you look at
BHO or CO2 or any solvent extract,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have all of the,
uh, the terpenes extracted with that
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not just getting the terpenes in
the resin head, like you do with hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting all of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's, it's kind of what sets
bubble hash apart and makes its high so
[SPEAKER_01]: unique, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it just, it just seems like such a
refined high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even better is a solvent extract from
bubble hash, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think I've had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, that's, that's always a fun
one to do for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I think, you know, I mean,
I love Rasen so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think that, that hashish,
Rasen, it's, it's just the best for my
[SPEAKER_01]: palate right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you for the explanation of the
star system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also all this extra stuff at the
