[SPEAKER_01]: To the extent that the cannabis industry
has rock stars, Dr. Ethan Russo is one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: His groundbreaking research on cannabis
terpenes, the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid deficiency, and
phytocannabinoids in general are all
[SPEAKER_01]: essential reading for anyone looking to
really understand the interaction between
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis plant and humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the first time I invited Dr.
Russo to speak here on Vashon Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 75 chairs set up like we normally
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally we would for a Vashon Island
Marijuana Entrepreneur's Alliance meeting,
[SPEAKER_01]: and those chairs filled up really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we used the rest of the chairs that
were in the closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we were out of chairs,
folks sat on pillows and jackets on the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor in front of the chairs, and finally
it was standing room only in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That night it was like an old school
teach-in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was excited to have an
opportunity to hear Dr. Russo speak in
[SPEAKER_01]: person and have their questions answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, for years it has been nearly
impossible for regular people to hear Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russo speak because he worked at GW
Pharmaceuticals and pretty much only spoke
[SPEAKER_01]: at high-priced exclusive pharmaceutical
conventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember very clearly the day I received
an email from Ethan saying that he was no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer at GW, and he was now free to
accept my speaking invitation for a simple
[SPEAKER_01]: log cabin Grange Hall on Vashon Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sounded very excited, because,
you know, Ethan really isn't an ivory
[SPEAKER_01]: tower kind of researcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's more interested in speaking directly
to patients and working in the field like
[SPEAKER_01]: he had done previously in Morocco,
China, and Peru.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Russo's research paper titled,
Taming THC, Potential Cannabis Synergy and
[SPEAKER_01]: Phytocannabinoid Turpenoid Entourage
Effects, has become a cornerstone of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: For many folks, myself included,
it was the first time we had read a
[SPEAKER_01]: detailed paper explaining the interplay of
different phytocannabinoids in a
[SPEAKER_01]: conversational tone that anyone could
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find a link to the paper on our
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to The Shaping Fire
Podcast, and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: On today's episode, we will go point by
point through the entire text of Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russo's Taming THC paper and enjoy some
rare commentary from Dr. Russo himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to hear more candid
interviews with the cannabis industry's

[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ethan Russo is a board certified
neurologist and former senior medical
[SPEAKER_01]: advisor to GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: He served as study physician to GW
Pharmaceuticals for three phase three
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials of Sativex.
[SPEAKER_01]: He graduated from the University of
Pennsylvania and the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts Medical School before
residencies in pediatrics in Phoenix,
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona and in child and adult neurology
at the University of Washington in
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a clinical neurologist in Missoula,
Montana for 20 years in a practice with a
[SPEAKER_01]: strong chronic pain component.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1995, he pursued a three-month
sabbatical doing ethnobotanical research
[SPEAKER_01]: with indigenous people in Peru.
[SPEAKER_01]: He joined GW as a full-time consultant in
2003.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has held faculty appointments in
pharmaceutical sciences at the University
[SPEAKER_01]: of Montana, in medicine at the University
of Washington, and as visiting professor
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been president of the International
Cannabinoid Research Society and is former
[SPEAKER_01]: chairman of the International Association
for Cannabinoid Medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is author of several books on cannabis
medicine and has published over 30
[SPEAKER_01]: articles in neurology, pain management,
cannabis, and ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm really glad that you were
willing to make the time to join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with something pretty
basic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that phytocannabinoids exist
and there must be a reason that they exist
[SPEAKER_01]: in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what natural benefit do
phytocannabinoids offer to the plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes them exist in the first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, straight out of the chute,
it's important to relate that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: there for human enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant itself is much older than humans
are as a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They perform an ecological role in the
plant and actually it's more than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things is that the cannabinoids
protect the plant from genetic damage from
[SPEAKER_00]: ultraviolet light exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we know is that
production of the cannabinoids will be
[SPEAKER_00]: increased with higher light pressure and
at a higher elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two things go together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting role of the
cannabinoids is that some of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticidal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a bug lands on the flower,
there are two ways in which the bug can
[SPEAKER_00]: meet its demise.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is from a chemical attack by the
cannabinoids and the other is just the
[SPEAKER_00]: stickiness of the trichomes will trap
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, the cannabinoids also are helpful
in pruning the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it's trying to mature and become
fertilized, these will rain down on the
[SPEAKER_00]: fan leaves and they will tend to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the plant is doing near the end of
its year of growth is putting all the
[SPEAKER_00]: effort, chemically speaking, into getting
fertilized and nurturing that flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hopes that it will become fertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's usually thwarted by humans that
want it to remain unfertilized to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: greater cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearing you describe it almost as a
defense mechanism and as a plant regulator
[SPEAKER_01]: because in our own endocannabinoid system,
that's the same thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: phytocannabinoids do for us, the defense
and regulation of our systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There must be some similarity at a nature
level where these chemicals are helping
[SPEAKER_01]: living things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's increasing appreciation now that
these plant defense compounds also extend
[SPEAKER_00]: towards effects on humans too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very interesting book by Kennedy
called Plants and the Human Brain that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes into these relationships in greater
depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these antioxidants that the plant
produces to prevent diseases have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of protective functions in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the reason that a highly varied
plant diet seems to help prevent aging,
[SPEAKER_00]: help prevent cancer and things of this
sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, instead of talking necessarily
about defending the plant, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be talking about these different
phytocannabinoids effects on our humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of terms that could be
unfamiliar to folks that we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: run into today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of them that I ran into from
rereading the paper now because I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: read it in a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get into the meat of the
topic, I'd really appreciate it if you
[SPEAKER_01]: would explain the difference for folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between an agonist and an
antagonist because I feel we'll probably
[SPEAKER_01]: be using that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have receptors on our cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the place that's most familiar to
people would be in neurotransmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, how nerve cells
communicate one to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a combination of chemical and
electrical transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: But receptors on cells are things that
help affect a certain kind of reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can think of it as a lock and key
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's a lot more complicated than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an agonist will be like a key that
fits in the lock and produces a
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulation of a certain function.
[SPEAKER_00]: An antagonist goes in the opposite
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lowers the function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got modifiers beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things called inverse agonists,
which despite the way it sounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually lower the overall activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like a super antagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll explain these in context as they
come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to really simplify it, an agonist is
more likely to increase the effect and an
[SPEAKER_01]: antagonist is more likely to decrease the
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another aspect that you mentioned in the
paper, a few times that I'd love to hear
[SPEAKER_01]: broken out before we get into it,
is Raphael Mishulam's law of stinginess,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I love the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had not heard that referred to
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could explain that example
before we get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he means is enzymes, which are
catalysts that help bring a reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: onward, may act on more than one
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A substrate is a chemical that is turning
into another chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, there are two basic kinds
of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The propyl with a three carbon side chain
and the pentol with a five carbon side
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certain enzymes can work on both.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other enzymes that aren't
following the law of stinginess that may
[SPEAKER_00]: only work on one compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to jump into the first wave
of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I was telling folks in the
introduction, we're kind of going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through them as a list, the way that you
do in the paper, in a couple of groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one being THC, CBD, and the ones
that we're more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll move on to the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll talk about their applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that we could do an entire show
just on THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is the first cannabinoid that you
go ahead and explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start there with the big elephant
in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you would, kind of review THC and
how it relates to phyto cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, THC is probably the single chemical
most associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is the primary psychoactive
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the compound that makes
people high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a lot of very important medical
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an analgesic, meaning a painkiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an antispasmodic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It prevents spasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lowers muscle tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a muscle relaxant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the basis for its use in treating
spasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muscle tone tightness that occurs in
multiple sclerosis and a variety of other
[SPEAKER_00]: brain diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that benefit has made Sativex,
which does contain THC, an approved drug
[SPEAKER_00]: in 27 countries, just not here in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm talking to patients, one of the
examples that I give for how THC actually
[SPEAKER_01]: decreases pain is I said, you know,
there's two paths to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first path is its anti-inflammatory
muscle relaxation and gentrification.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a general analgesic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also what I've gotten started
calling cascading forgetfulness,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we talk with cannabis folks and,
you know, you get a little high and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you forget where you put your keys and you
go on doing other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that kind of idea of
short-term forgetting often has patients
[SPEAKER_01]: forget that they're in pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also, I think, why it works so
well with PTSD folks, because you just get
[SPEAKER_01]: distracted by life and you get involved
and you forget that you're in pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to think about it having these
two different paths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's a fair way to describe
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sure is, because you've hit on
two of the key mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a direct effect against pain that
works through complex pathways in the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain, spinal cord and nerves out in the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other is the way it modulates the
emotional part of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, part of it is distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But additionally, there have been studies
that show that the emotional factor in
[SPEAKER_00]: pain is considerably reduced by
cannabinoids and specifically by THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that combination together is quite
powerful and doing something that other
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs just don't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can't be the only one
listening to you talk right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling a little giddy to be able to get
information directly from the source.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so many of us who are trying to
learn about cannabis, we're getting our
[SPEAKER_01]: information from secondary sources,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondary sources are not really as
good as hearing it right from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, it's a real joy to actually
hear it in your own words.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one more thing on THC before we move
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love for you to review a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC in isolate is not the magical thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talked a little bit about that in
the introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But would you talk about the importance of
not using THC on its own and that it needs
[SPEAKER_01]: the other phytocannabinoids to be there
with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the easiest thing would be an
illustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC as a single compound, a synthetic
form, was approved in the United States in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1985.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was to treat nausea associated
with chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many people talk about tolerated it
poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost no one liked it the way that they
might like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would use both said this really
isn't like cannabis, cannabis works a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't something that everyone was
prepared to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, the government had an
investment in the idea that, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've given you access to THC,
you don't need cannabis for medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that in my neurology
practice after Marinol synthetic THC was
[SPEAKER_00]: down scheduled in 1999, I used it pretty
extensively for the next four years in a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of contexts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very tricky drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite different to cannabis in that
it's likely to produce dysphoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's unhappiness as opposed to
euphoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very distracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a very fine line between a
dose that might help symptoms like
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing pain and that which produces
unwanted side effects like distraction or
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, THC as alone has what
we call a very narrow therapeutic index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in contrast, when there are other
ingredients aboard, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol or certain of the turbo
terpenoids, you get a great expansion of
[SPEAKER_00]: that therapeutic index so that much more
THC can be used to better effect and
[SPEAKER_00]: without so many adverse events or side
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we move on to CBD, let's talk
briefly about THCA, which is the naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring acid form of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think most of us know that to
convert the naturally forming THC into
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, we need to add some heat to
decarboxylate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people are looking at THCA
for different therapeutic effects than
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the different therapeutic effects
between the two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're quite distinct in their
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA is considered non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, it doesn't produce the
high that we associate with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, THCA is also an
anti-inflammatory, but through a different
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects a molecule called tumor
necrosis factor alpha that is important in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain autoimmune diseases such as
Crohn's, ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid
[SPEAKER_00]: arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, and this one needs a lot
more work, there seems to be benefit in
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC can be helpful in epilepsy too,
but there seems to be a distinct mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: that really hasn't been adequately
explored yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So despite raw cannabis having been used
medicinally for a long time throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: history, it just hasn't received the
research that THC itself has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a place where we need to learn a
lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention one other thing that it can
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be very powerful against
certain tumors, particularly skin tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, this is an area that really
deserves more research attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that we could probably do an
entire show just devoted to CBD as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: we could with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's go ahead and review Cannabidiol
and talk about how it is so helpful to the
[SPEAKER_01]: human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, there's this dichotomy that's
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people tend to think a
cannabidiol is the good cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: where THC is the bad cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really reject that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both have their place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, for most kinds of problems,
a combination, in other words,
[SPEAKER_00]: using a type of cannabis that contains
both is usually a distinct advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really fascinating, because
cannabidiol, being a different molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: just by a little bit, has quite distinct
features.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of its activities are similar to THC
in that both are anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are analgesic painkillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as compared to THC, cannabidiol
actually reduces anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an anti-psychotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, it's been used in
schizophrenia to treat that disorder
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a whole list of other properties
beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, while we're on that, let's go ahead
and plug the great website at ProjectCBD
[SPEAKER_01]: .org.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a great page on their website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can click on the word conditions on
the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it lists a whole bunch of different
human ailments that you might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can click on any condition,
and they will pull up for you the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific studies that are showing that
the different cannabinoids, the effect it
[SPEAKER_01]: can have, whether you have Parkinson's or
pain or asthma or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's ProjectCBD.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ethan, a lot of us have heard of THC
and CBD, but there's all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is CBD so powerful?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it popular because it is so unique from
the other cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it because it's the first one to get
extensive research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, if you ask me, in my
experience as a physician and researcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: the single most versatile medicine that
I've ever encountered, it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are at least 30 distinct activities
that it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is what's often derisively termed a
dirty drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a dirty drug may also be one that
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the remarkable thing about CBD is,
at the same time, if you asked me the
[SPEAKER_00]: safest drug, the one with the fewest side
effects that I've ever encountered,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would also be cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are very few of the things
that it does, even at very high doses,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are deleterious to the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a remarkable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps its greatest attribute is that
it's able to modulate the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know that you've discussed the
endocannabinoid system with your audience
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but just to mention again,
it's a great homeostatic regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, it brings various
physiological systems in the body back
[SPEAKER_00]: into balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since cannabidiol is a general
stimulant to endocannabinoid tone,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has the capability of improving
function in any of a variety of areas of
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology that might be deranged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's pain, it helps with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's too much activity in the gut,
it will reduce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's too little, it will increase
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a sort of buffering effect to
bring physiology back into balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that in Chinese medicine,
they call that a tonifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings you back to neutral,
to the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's exactly a great analogy
there, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest this week is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become only with steam, that's right,
[SPEAKER_01]: only steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, terpenes from true terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean is, other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when you stack those terpenes to make
your blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes also have strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset
Sherbet, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_01]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_01]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_01]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
true terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_01]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_01]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Choose true terpenes for a top-shelf
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash true
terpenes to find out more, or click on the
[SPEAKER_01]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is world-renowned
cannabis researcher and neurologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we hit the two
biggies, THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to continue down the
list of the other phyto-cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_01]: are mentioned in your famous taming THC
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to start with one of the
very rarely talked about ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you tell us about CBC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is one that needs a lot more
work and a lot more attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the problem is that
cannabichromine is formed by a recessive
[SPEAKER_00]: gene in contrast to THC and CBD,
where the pathways are from dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bit of a rarer bird in most
commercially available forms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, it has a feature of being a
little more prominent in immature plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people wait until maturity,
there's going to be less CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of my colleagues from GW
Pharmaceuticals, David Potter,
[SPEAKER_00]: used young plants to make what he called
an enriched trichome product, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: another way of saying hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made this with young plants that did
show a predilection towards making more
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabichromine, CBC, and was able to get
a good concentration that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's never been used in a
clinical trial yet, despite having great
[SPEAKER_00]: promise on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say it appears most in young
plants, you're meaning young plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: are early in the bloom, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that they're forming trichomes as part
of the blooming cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you mean young as in they're still
in veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it'd be during the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: As with the other cannabinoids,
the greatest production is going to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: the capitate glandular trichomes that
appear in the unfertilized female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just be earlier in the flowering
cycle, as you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make a difference between
that and something like canna flavin,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is actually in a young plant,
but also early in the veg stage,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I understood it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in the sprouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like we definitely need more
research into CBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since it's a less common one,
aggressive breeders could start focusing
[SPEAKER_01]: on hybridizing for more CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be an advantage, because as CBD is
an endocannabinoid modulator, so too is
[SPEAKER_00]: CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBC is also anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very active against a variety of
cancer cell lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shows a lot of promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've heard of CBG a little more often,
and there are many labs that are able to
[SPEAKER_01]: start testing for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we care about CBG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's sort of the parent molecule to
the other phyto-cannabinoid, so that alone
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But normally in the plant, it doesn't stop
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes onward to either THC, CBD,
or CBC, or the propyl cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there have been plants bred in
England that quit at CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the enzymatic equipment
due to a mutation to go beyond it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in those plants, 100% of the
cannabinoids would be used as
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabigerol, again, is one I'm excited
about for the future, because again,
[SPEAKER_00]: this hasn't been used in human clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has very interesting properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be a very strong anti-anxiety
agent without being sedating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the drugs that are used that way
in humans, like benzodiazepines,
[SPEAKER_00]: Valium, et cetera, are not only sedating,
but addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is quite different to what we see
with CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no indication that it would be
addictive at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, it has some muscle relaxant
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, interestingly, is a strong antibiotic
or disinfectant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things it does is it works
against MRSA, that's multiply resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: Staphylococcus aureus, one of those
hospital acquired infections that was
[SPEAKER_00]: rampant throughout the US a few years ago,
and poses a real risk for hospitalized
[SPEAKER_00]: patients that might be quite ill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if CBG is kind of a parent cannabinoid,
does that mean that when it degrades with
[SPEAKER_01]: time or light that it could degrade into a
different cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not unless the plant is alive to
provide the enzymes to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, usually in the plant machinery of
cannabinoid production, it just doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on through to the next item.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so usually, CBG doesn't accumulate in
great amounts in a given plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, earlier in 2016, THCV was all
through the media because people started
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about its appetite suppression
attributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And supposedly, some of the forms of Blue
Dream are heavy in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people love the idea that you could
use cannabis, but also not get the
[SPEAKER_01]: munchies.
[SPEAKER_01]: How effective is THCV to actually suppress
the appetite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it do it a little bit, or does it
really not give you the munchies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in pure form, which would not be,
accessible to people, it's quite prominent
[SPEAKER_00]: in its appetite suppression effects
without a speedy effect that one would
[SPEAKER_00]: get, say, from an amphetamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is quite distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble is, in cannabis that's
available in commerce in North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually the amount of tetrahydrocannabin
or THCV is quite, quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, in England, there is a plant
where over 90% of the cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed as THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one has been used in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has the added benefit of being a
pretty good anticonvulsant drug for
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beyond the appetite suppressant part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be helpful in the metabolic
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be the problems that people
get into if they're diabetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diabetic or pre-diabetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you just said there was pretty
heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that the commercially available
cannabis strains that have THCV don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really have enough in it to truly suppress
the appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking that to the extreme end and
talking about the example that you gave
[SPEAKER_01]: from the UK, where it's 90%, if you
ingested that strain, would it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: suppress the appetite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or does it just make a really good target
for extraction to extract THCV out of it
[SPEAKER_01]: to then apply that to the patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: That particular plant, when it's
extracted, even with a little bit of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: in it, does have the benefits that I
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is, though, that at least in the
US, we're not there yet in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: optimizing THCV chemo of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The available ones may produce less of the
munchies, but they're not going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the attributes that we mentioned
that have been seen with the extracts that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been used in clinical trials so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your paper taming THC after THCV,
you move to CBDV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this one also has just started in
human use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the corresponding agent to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as THC is to THCV, CBDV is as to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this looks like CBD, but it's got a
three carbon side chain instead of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's being investigated for seizures
of partial onset, what used to be called
[SPEAKER_00]: focal seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be a good signal there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really couldn't say a lot more about how
it affects people yet, except that it
[SPEAKER_00]: appears to be non-intoxicating and appears
to be quite safe in the experiments that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been done so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last year, we've seen a lot of new
products coming out that are supplemented
[SPEAKER_01]: with CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them, people are saying,
well, CBN totally helps you sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they'll take their product,
an edible or something, and they'll add
[SPEAKER_01]: CBN to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that CBN will have that kind
of effect when supplemented into edibles?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a proponent of spiking things in
that manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal bias is that with time and
attention and proper selective breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get the effects you want from a
given cannabis kinavar without needing to
[SPEAKER_00]: add anything to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, there's some misconceptions
about cannabinol or CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a pure compound, it really is not very
sedating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is THC-like, but about a quarter of the
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The confusion may arise because CBN is a
non-intoxicated enzymatic breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: product of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, in old cannabis,
it will oxidize from THC into CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, you get a loss of the
monoterpenoids, and you get remaining some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the higher molecular weight
sesquiterpenoids that tend to be sedating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so old cannabis tends to be soporific.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a medical lease for saying that it
makes you sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the CBN itself is not strongly
sedating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to save this for the next
section when we talk about terpenoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let's talk about it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you explain the difference between
monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenoids are built up of five carbon
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The so-called monoterpenoids have 10
carbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sesquiterpenoids have 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diterpenoids have 20, and the
triterpenoids have 30 carbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpene means there's confusion about
these terms, but a terpenoid is a broader
[SPEAKER_00]: term and would include agents that have
oxygen in them or occasionally other
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: A terpene, strictly speaking, has just
carbon and hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one more thing on CBN before we move on
to the group of terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's common said amongst cannabis folk
that, say for example, oh, I've got this
[SPEAKER_01]: flower left over from last summer's grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all CBN now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you smoke it, you'll just get couch
lock and fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while that's kind of a rule of thumb,
you mentioning that CBN is not really all
[SPEAKER_01]: that sedative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there truth to the rule of thumb that I
just explained, or is that more myth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the phenomenology, in other words,
the description you gave is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of older cannabis is going to be
sedating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be stimulating necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people find it less attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it would be from the sedative
influences of the remaining terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of us know that terpenoids are the
smell of the plant now, the aromatherapy,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you explain what exactly a terpenoid
is and why the plant bothers to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are produced in the glandular
trichomes along with the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these are molecules that the
plant makes often in its defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these are insect repellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others actually attract certain desirable
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're often antioxidants and
antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we can leverage what the plant
has done to help our own ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that when I'm shopping for
cannabis, I usually shop with my nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, I like bag appeal as
much as anybody does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, we're opening jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sticking our nose in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when our body has this reaction of,
yeah, I want more of this, we go ahead and
[SPEAKER_01]: choose that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any support or truth to the fact
that our body, when smelling specific
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenoids, knows what it needs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our body is self-selecting for the
medicine that's best for us then?
[SPEAKER_00]: May well be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a hard thing to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The situation that you describe is quite
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle Sexton, naturopath, who's
investigated this, looked at patient
[SPEAKER_00]: preferences in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number one criterion for selection
of a particular cannabis chemovar was its
[SPEAKER_00]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that doesn't surprise me at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, what's interesting,
too, is how strains that have got wildly
[SPEAKER_01]: different smells, I can be attracted to
both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can smell something that's really foul
and skunky and smells like a baby diaper,
[SPEAKER_01]: like perhaps a funky cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, I really need some of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll smell some lemon diesel with
a really bright citrus smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, I want that,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting how we can be,
our human, can be attracted to a variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of terpenes that are very much unlike each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as they say, variety is the spice of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are terpenoids from cannabis and food
and other sources the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have the same effect regardless of
where they're from when they're in
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in general, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no terpenoids that we know of
that appear only in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain profiles that are
characteristic, but these are part of
[SPEAKER_00]: everyday life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're eating citrus, you're exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a walk in a forest,
you're exposed to pineine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a plant-based diet,
you're exposed to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key thing is how they synergize
with THC and other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the real difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the question were, will exposure to
terpenoids from food exert benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I believe that they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that in terms of the experience
one has with cannabis, they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental to the differences that one
experiences, one kemovar to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one more question before we go to our
next commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things that really
caught me off guard reading in your paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: you say that the terpenoids increase with
intensity of light, but decrease with soil
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really caught me off guard
because most of the growers I know are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make very fertile living soil to
help the terps develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it true that decreased soil
fertility will increase terpenoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, the rich soil at the
beginning is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But depletion of the soil towards the end
seems to help the terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shouldn't be a big surprise if we
consider that our herbs or lavender grow
[SPEAKER_00]: best in a sandy soil where environmental
conditions are a little rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that the terpenoids are plant
defense compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the environment is a little more
difficult, your terpenoid production is
[SPEAKER_00]: going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people growing cannabis, having a
little less water and a lot less nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the end of the flowering cycle are
going to produce the same kind of effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, now that we've got all the
growers' attention, when would you
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease the nutrients and water to get
that effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you that exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are people who know,
but I'm not sure off the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take another short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest this week is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone who is paying attention to
cannabis medicine, it has become
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly apparent that full extract
cannabis oil, known to some as Rick
[SPEAKER_01]: Simpson oil, is the cornerstone of healing
humans with medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you own a medical dispensary or retail
store, you know that your customers are
[SPEAKER_01]: asking for it every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have been working with patients
and seeking out quality full extract oil
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Pacific Northwest, you know the
provider Deep Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kat Jeter and her team at Deep Green have
been making full extract cannabis oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: setting the standards for quality and
exact dosing for years in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Deep Green brand is known by patients
and cannabis media as a premium quality
[SPEAKER_01]: provider for sick children, cancer
patients, and others in need.
[SPEAKER_01]: At a time when there are no national
standards for cannabis oil, ensuring a
[SPEAKER_01]: product is whole plant, quality assured,
and lab tested is often a matter of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing your source is reputable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust in a quality brand is essential when
choosing a cannabis medicine that is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be used concentrated and in volume by
any patient, and especially those with
[SPEAKER_01]: weakened immune systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep Green is looking for national brand
partners to expand the availability of
[SPEAKER_01]: their legacy top shelf cannabis oil to
emerging medical and licensed states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partners benefit from the Deep Green brand
recognition and credibility, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: ongoing customer and marketing support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but Deep Green knows how to
employ the 280E tax rule so you can deduct
[SPEAKER_01]: it all from your taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working with Deep Green can provide the
trust and authenticity too often pushed
[SPEAKER_01]: aside in favor of lifestyle products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your customers can assure themselves that
regardless of the state in which it is
[SPEAKER_01]: made, brand licensees adhere to the same
strict standards that patients everywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: have come to expect from Deep Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep Green licensing includes startup and
capital planning, as well as operational
[SPEAKER_01]: and manufacturing instruction,
as you'd expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: For more information on how your company
co-op or medical dispensary can benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: from partnering with Deep Green to provide
full extract cannabis oil to patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: go to shapingfire.com forward slash Deep
Green to connect with Kat Jeter and her
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's shapingfire.com forward slash Deep
Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is world renowned
cannabis researcher and neurologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we kind of set up the
terpenoids and talked about what they are
[SPEAKER_01]: as a group and kind of what their
attributes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this section, we're gonna go
through the very specific terpenoids that
[SPEAKER_01]: you talk about in your groundbreaking
paper, Taming THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's good to have a favorite,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, limonene is a really fascinating
compound and it's pretty ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the place you're most
likely to run into it is walking down the
[SPEAKER_00]: detergent aisle at the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: To our senses, the scent of lemon or
citrus denotes cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a reason it's there that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It not only makes an efficient cleaning
agent, but it has a strong psychological
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of brightness, cleanliness,
and improved mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what limonene will
produce when it's there in a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: amount along with the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell people who are unfamiliar with
terpenes that if they wanna have the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience of limonene to just simply cut
a piece of citrus fruit like a lemon and
[SPEAKER_01]: you smell it and suddenly you feel
motivated and happy and full of sunshine
[SPEAKER_01]: and joy and that is the terpenes having a
direct effect on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you cut a lemon, is that limonene?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you cut an orange,
that's citrine?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're both primarily limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between the various citrus
fruits, almost all of them have very high
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of limonene in the rind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take your thumbnail across the rind
of a citrus, you're releasing trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: and limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The differences in the smells and taste
come from much lower concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, other terpenoids that are
distinctly distinct from one another in
[SPEAKER_00]: the various kinds of citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That certainly kinda explains why so many
cocktails are served with a twist,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as you're bringing the cocktail up
to your nose, you're getting this hit of
[SPEAKER_01]: limonene that's making you feel joyous as
you're enjoying the cocktail and no wonder
[SPEAKER_01]: we like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next one that you cover in the
paper is beta-murecine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Murecine is the most prevalent terpenoid
in most available chemo-virus of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there are people that prefer it,
but it has a strongly sedating
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotic-like effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there's a kind of cannabis that
makes people unable to move, what's
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly termed couch-lock, it's likely
that it's due to a high Murecine content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not always an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone needs to sleep or needs to
relax, certainly it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the plus side, Murecine does have
analgesic, pain-killing properties on a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of other properties that can be
beneficial, but in general there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of it out there and maybe more than is
needed for optimal effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly for people after work or study,
it's usually not an advantage to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: high concentration of Murecine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be remiss if we didn't touch
on mangoes here for a moment because a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people say that, you know, if you want
to enjoy your cannabis especially well,
[SPEAKER_01]: go ahead and eat a mango before it because
the Murecine improves the experience of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of that is myth and how much of
that is real?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a paper that was done on
the terpenoid content of mangoes and it
[SPEAKER_00]: varies from being a fair amount to some
where there's almost none.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, a lot of people will say
that Murecine helps to get THC across the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, normally THC has no problem getting
across the blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these compounds are what we call
lipophilic, fat-loving and they all go
[SPEAKER_00]: right into the brain without any
difficulty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think mangoes are really healthy and
people should eat them because they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to or enjoy it, but I think the likelihood
that that's going to have a material
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on their experience is pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's talk about one of my
favorites, Alpha Pinene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the first times that I
heard you speak, it really impressed me
[SPEAKER_01]: that I love walking in the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that Nordic term to take a,
maybe it's a Japanese term, anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a forest bath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were explaining how when you go
into the forest and you're around these
[SPEAKER_01]: pine trees and they're giving off pinene
and you take a big breath and you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: your lungs sacks and you're like,
hmm, the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually what you're getting is a big
hit of pinene, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Shinrin Yoku or forest bathing is
just the act of walking in a forest in
[SPEAKER_00]: Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of people,
if they've had a difficult work day,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to clear their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what they'll do,
particularly in the Pacific Northwest is
[SPEAKER_00]: take a walk in a pine forest or in our
instance, it's going to be other conifers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're all rich in pinene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effect on one's mood is going to be
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes further than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, pinene is less common in
modern chemo bars of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of been shoved aside by nursing,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in chemo bars that have it,
the end result is an experience that's
[SPEAKER_00]: much clearer without the confusion and the
short term memory that people often equate
[SPEAKER_00]: with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly THC does produce impairment of
short term memory, but pinene is what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called a cholinesterase inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It inhibits the breakdown of
acetylcholine, which is the main memory
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it reverses this effect that THC has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly for a patient who needs
cannabis, having pinene in the chemo bar
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're using is much more likely,
if they use it, it'd be much more likely
[SPEAKER_00]: that they'll be able to work or study
without the impairment that can come in if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's too much THC or if there's too
much sedation from nursing, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something with a lot of pinene would be
really good for daytime because you can be
[SPEAKER_01]: more productive and a little more focused
and have more likelihood to stay on task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'd emphasize that a lot of
this is subject to people's preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some people that love the Mersenne
couchlock effect and others really dislike
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taste comes into this in a big way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm actually one of those people
that loves Mersenne.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can enjoy the most couchlock-iest
strains and still have a good time with it
[SPEAKER_01]: because I tend to run really hot and fast
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally stay away from sativas just
because they tend to overamp me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the important parts of
individualized medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where one size does not fit all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people are originally getting
into cannabis, they should take some time
[SPEAKER_01]: to sample a wide variety of strains so
that they can taste a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different terpenoids and find out the one
that their human enjoys the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'd extend that to therapeutic
applications, the one that's going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them the best benefits on their symptoms
and produce the fewest side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I correct that linalool, the next
terpenoid we're going to talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty heavy in lavender and is one of
the aspects that makes us feel so calm
[SPEAKER_01]: when we smell it or use a lavender eye
pillow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pretty remarkable compound in addition
to having those anti-anxiety effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can aid sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very strong local anesthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I always like to talk
about is that people should keep a bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: of lavender essential oil in the fridge in
the kitchen because if you get a kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: burn and put the lavender oil on neat and
cover it with an ice cube, the pain will
[SPEAKER_00]: generally go away in a few minutes and
almost never blister.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too intense straight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you need to thin it out with
something?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how some essential oils will burn
the skin?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a good point, but lavender oil
is safe to use neat, undiluted on the
[SPEAKER_00]: skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our next one, beta-karyophylline,
I had a really cool experience with a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was down in Sonoma County for Emerald
Cup and I was staying at a house with a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bunch of cannabis business owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of just split this wine country
villa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Ben Cassaday from True Terpenes and
he was going around the house and giving
[SPEAKER_01]: people some beta-karyophylline in their
hands and then he was encouraging us to
[SPEAKER_01]: cup our hands to our face.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a faint smell of black pepper,
but the thing that was remarkable was how
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly calming it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never really considered dosing
myself with terpenes in such a simple and
[SPEAKER_01]: elegant way as to just put a little bit in
my palm and then cup it to my nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a direct pathway to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we need to explore more
because generally, karyophylline is
[SPEAKER_00]: considered, quote, non-psychoactive,
unquote, but certainly it has powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory effects and in a
situation where someone had inflammation
[SPEAKER_00]: for any reason, particularly in the brain,
it's very likely going to be therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: and that could manifest itself in a change
of mood, certainly, but it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: remarkable because karyophylline,
which is a sesquiterpenoid, in other
[SPEAKER_00]: words, 15-carbon molecule, it's not just a
terpenoid, it's a cannabinoid,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a strong agonist, a stimulator at
the CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the cannabinoid receptor that's
non-psychoactive and is important out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the body and potentially in the brain for
pain and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fascinating agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's common in our diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned black pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most accessible source,
but there are other good examples like
[SPEAKER_00]: copibabalsum, which has been used in South
America to treat inflammation,
[SPEAKER_00]: sprains, and skin conditions for
generations by indigenous people long
[SPEAKER_00]: before we knew anything about the
chemicals in it, which is primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we need an expanded
vocabulary because that idea of being
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactive or not, a lot of people are
talking about THC being psychoactive and
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD being non-psychoactive and then
beta-karyophylline not being psychoactive,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know that when I smelled it in my
palms, it clearly had a calming effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: which tells me that it is active
psychologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it was psychoactive, but it did
not have that getting high or stony effect
[SPEAKER_01]: that THC does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels to me like over time,
we need to develop and widen our
[SPEAKER_01]: vocabulary for these experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd endorse that approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a paper written about that or
anything that you'd recommend that I and
[SPEAKER_01]: others read about that delineation or has
that work not really taken place yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably more the latter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some extensive reviews on
karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really looking at the effects that it has
on the brain or on mood have just begun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, a lot of the real emphasis
isn't on karyophylline, but trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic drugs that would be like it that
might be more marketable from an
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual property standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that such effort is misguided when
we have a readily available natural agent
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not only effective, but quite safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this great term that we got from
Dr. Dominic Korova of CASP when he was on
[SPEAKER_01]: this show a couple months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks about whole plant politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like myself in this show and from
what I understand, you as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: we believe in the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's use the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's emphasize the entourage effect and
let's not focus as much our research on
[SPEAKER_01]: finding synthetic replacements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work on the plant even though it may
be not possible to patent it as
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe in that approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until about the last 70 years,
medicine was synonymous with plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still that way for many people in the
third world and indigenous peoples around
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next terpenoid I actually have never
heard pronounced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to butcher it and then you can
fix it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it nirolidal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nirolidal, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nirolidal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, I have never learned anything
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not that common in most
North American cannabis chemovars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a minor component of citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some interesting antifungal
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It penetrates the skin really well and can
tend to drag other things in along with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not one that a lot of people
are going to encounter in North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the reason for that because it's not
popular in the commercial cannabis world
[SPEAKER_01]: or is it because those cultivars are from
really exotic foreign countries that we
[SPEAKER_01]: just don't have the genetics here?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the reason we don't come across it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we knew more about the ecological role
that it had, I could probably give a
[SPEAKER_00]: better answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've stumped me on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to karyophylline oxide.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can tell from the name,
this just has an extra oxygen on it as
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, very powerful antifungal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be the solution to nail fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, its real distinction is it
seems to be the chemical in cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: sniffer dogs key in on to identify
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what they thought when it
was examined in Austria about 35 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's really done any work on it since.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a research project for somebody
who'd like to look into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a laundry list of
up-and-coming research scientists about
[SPEAKER_01]: all the cool areas of cannabis that are
still just waiting for people to dive
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article is almost six years old now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a bunch of suggestions and a lot
of them haven't had follow-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one in this section is phytol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytol is pretty universal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any dried herb is going to have some in it
because it's basically a breakdown product
[SPEAKER_00]: of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting about it is it's
probably responsible for the calming
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of green tea, even though green tea
has caffeine in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main thing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If cannabis is purely flour and not a lot
of leaf, there won't be much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a diterbinoid, the only 20-carbon
molecule that's common in herbal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we wrap up this section,
I'd like to circle back around to your
[SPEAKER_01]: suggestion that you're not a big fan of
spiking cannabis and cannabis products
[SPEAKER_01]: with terpenoids or probably any
phytocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks are now taking products from edibles
to tinctures, and they're starting with
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant, which is great, but then they
want to turn up some aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say they want to make it a little more
stimulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll drop some limonene in there,
or they want to say it's more for pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so they'll drop some mircine in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long as you start with a whole plant
base, so you do have all the minor
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids in there, what is the reason
why you're not so much of a fan of spiking
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit of one or the other for
its therapeutic effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's multiple reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we don't necessarily know the
source of the terpenoids, whether they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been organically produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the right stereoisomer?
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody goes online to a chemical
supply house and looks up limonene,
[SPEAKER_00]: it isn't going to be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be several.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a simple thing for a person to
pick the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, most of these aren't 100% pure,
and they're not designed for internal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's compare that to organically
grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what its side effects are,
but it's very different using a
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesized chemical and adding that to
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, I'd reemphasize what I
said previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is capable of doing almost
anything you wish, given the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to selective breeding for the
desired components.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, there's no substitute for someone
taking the time and effort to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, a lot of the things you mentioned in
terms of spiking can be illuminating for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to understand the different
effects, but as a practice, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: something I'd really encourage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, there's another important reason,
and that is a lot of these are in
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial development of one kind or
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a lot of companies are
pursuing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot spike a natural plant and
develop a drug out of it through the Food
[SPEAKER_00]: and Drug Administration approval process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's considered a combination product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do the safety, efficacy,
and toxicity on the original material,
[SPEAKER_00]: the added material, and the two together,
so it triples the amount of investigation
[SPEAKER_00]: that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a financial standpoint, it makes it
an impossibility because developing a drug
[SPEAKER_00]: for FDA approval can be upwards of a
billion dollars at this point from start
[SPEAKER_00]: to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority are synthetically
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these are byproducts of petroleum
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemical company will make one thing
out of another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, let's say it's 95% pure and you've
got the right molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the other 5%?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say right on the bottle that it's
not designed to be used as medicine or
[SPEAKER_00]: taken internally or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a real potential danger there,
and I don't want to exaggerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a potential danger there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take our last commercial
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we come back, we're going to be
talking about the psychopharmacological
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts of these different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest this week is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like podcasts like Shaping Fire,
chances are that you will like audiobooks
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much, audiobooks are like podcasts
except with less stuttering, better
[SPEAKER_01]: production quality, and more targeted
topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make audiobooks sound better than a
podcast, and you know, maybe they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like podcasts too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to learn from people talking to me
while I'm doing something else like
[SPEAKER_01]: driving or cleaning my house or making
dinner or even being at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Audible.com has an offer I want to tell
you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, they are offering a trial of
their audiobook service for absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: free.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to shapingfire.com forward
slash audible, and you will get a free
[SPEAKER_01]: audiobook straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can listen to it on your mobile
device, on your computer, or you can
[SPEAKER_01]: download it and listen to it pretty much
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of course, they really want you
to subscribe to their service forever and
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy more and more audiobooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as cannabis users, you also know how
this goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to hate how I've said that,
but it's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I listened recently to Smoke
Signals by Martin Lee from ProjectCBD.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: Martin's book is a classic of cannabis
advocacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He explains the history of cannabis in
America, THC and CBD cannabis science,
[SPEAKER_01]: and why cannabis policy in America has
gotten so jacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you consider yourself a
cannabis person, this book really is a
[SPEAKER_01]: must.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking cannabis, we all sound radical
just because we're talking about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you learn the history and science
of cannabis, suddenly you become smart and
[SPEAKER_01]: trustworthy to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The book was really incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no doubt that Martin Lee is
the real deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the book for free just for
doing the trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you don't want to listen to a
cannabis book, that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's science.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's wifi and history, biography.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell, you can even listen to a book about
card counting in Blackjack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your first book is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to sign up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to quit, but they do do a pretty
good job making me want to stay every
[SPEAKER_01]: month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash
audible to find out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is world renowned
cannabis researcher and neurologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the last section of your paper,
Taming THC, you talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: psychopharmacological impacts that these
phytocannabinoids have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll touch on the same three that
you talk about in your paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with their impact on
depression and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, there is benefit to THC
and certainly to CBD in some of these mood
[SPEAKER_00]: disorders, but they can really strongly be
enhanced by the addition of the right
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenoid and particularly the pionene and
limonene respectively for clarity from the
[SPEAKER_00]: pionene and an antidepressant effect from
the limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a real synergy or boosting of
effect there where you get a much,
[SPEAKER_00]: much more dramatic effect in the
combination than you would be with any
[SPEAKER_00]: single molecule alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they're working together like this
for the entourage effect, you're finding
[SPEAKER_01]: that they kind of groups these together,
you know, depression, anxiety,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are all your endocannabinoid system
getting out of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're working together to
rebalance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're suggesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, that's that's certainly part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another actually people have this
misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid it's been spread around also by
the medical community that depression is a
[SPEAKER_00]: serotonin deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor to treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, that isn't good science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should think of depression as being a
disorder of plasticity of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, you've got a loss of the
ability to roll with the proverbial
[SPEAKER_00]: punches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things aren't working efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've lost lost the ability to react to
the environment in an optimal fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, one of the effects of the
cannabinoid seems to be increased to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase plasticity of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with mood enhancement from
limonene, that's a powerful combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you say plasticity, is that a part
of the removal of plaque that we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about when using phyto cannabinoids to to
help the brain remove plaque, thus
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting things like Alzheimer's and
causing neurogenesis and acting as a
[SPEAKER_01]: neuroprotectant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the neurogenesis the regeneration of
nerve cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are benefits of both THC and CBD
potentially in dementia like Alzheimer's
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there is the possibility that we
could help prevent plaque formation that
[SPEAKER_00]: is one of the hallmarks of that disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, very often when I'm talking with
patients, they're asking me about
[SPEAKER_01]: insomnia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, Oh my gosh, I need help getting
to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it always, you know,
as far as as part of the suggestion,
[SPEAKER_01]: I always try to find out if it's if it's,
you know, anxiety, and they can't slow
[SPEAKER_01]: their brain down, or whether or not
sometimes with patients, it's pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time they roll over,
it's pain, and then you have to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: the pain first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can go back and work with the
insomnia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's say, for example, that it's not
pain related.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, racing brain related.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to help people,
you know, settle down and slip into good
[SPEAKER_01]: slumber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, most of the professionals
that I talked to, we all kind of agree
[SPEAKER_01]: that the that the heavy purple indica
flowers, you know, that are packed with
[SPEAKER_01]: myrcin are a good way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I've never heard anybody
explain is that why that why it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a multifactorial medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it is just the sleepiness,
the hypnotic effect of some cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: components, including THC and mercy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both of those are also painkillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote about this about 10 years ago,
a review of effects of cannabis on sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the clinical trials that have been done
on cannabis based medicine, the symptom
[SPEAKER_00]: that is almost always alleviated is
insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's a combination of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one being that there may be a
hypnotic effect from the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that and more dramatic is the
reduction of symptoms allowing sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, if the person has pain,
reducing the pain allows them to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have restless legs and those are
calm, that allows them to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with spasticity, increased
muscle tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely the same thing with lower
urinary tract symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis, it's been shown that there
are fewer episodes of needing to get up at
[SPEAKER_00]: night to urinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly that can lead to better sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is the reduction in symptomatology
that's the most salient reason that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is a sleep aid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last one that you review in your
paper is addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's become pretty common for people
to use cannabis to move off narcotics,
[SPEAKER_01]: most common recently, but also alcoholism.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's complicated, but a lot of this
works through reward pathways in the brain
[SPEAKER_00]: that are mediated by a neurotransmitter
called dopamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, there are different
mechanisms operative.
[SPEAKER_00]: With THC, it's a little bit more
mysterious, but it would pertain to
[SPEAKER_00]: modulation of the reward pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabidiol, what has been noted is
that a lot of addiction is related to
[SPEAKER_00]: craving that comes about as a withdrawal
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to be mediated by an area
in the brain called the insula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabidiol has the ability to chemically
turn down the activity in the insula and
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate craving potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between the two, there can be a very
generous effect on addiction issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, that's a way more elegant
explanation than I've been giving people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that CBD will decrease the
craving instead of replacing whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: person is addicted to makes a lot of
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last thing that you cover in the
paper is that sometimes you have more THC
[SPEAKER_01]: than your body is prepared for,
and you start to feel uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that pretty much anybody who
has experimented with cannabis or has been
[SPEAKER_01]: a patient and tried to self-titrate their
usage to learn how much to use,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that most of us have had at some
point an over-medicated experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has got the range somewhere between
feeling a little uncomfortable and you
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to go be alone all the way to
your heart rate increases, your blood
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure drops, and you're wondering if
you should call the paramedics,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is never a fun experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm doing is I want to set up
for you, and I wish we had the wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: slide you use in your presentations,
but I would like you to tell the story
[SPEAKER_01]: that you tell about the perfect had too
much THC meal.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this leads us off on a historical
tangent, but when I was writing the paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested in historical antidotes
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go back, well, almost, well,
over 2,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There've been allusions to citrus as being
an antidote to cannabis, and it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: repeated in different cultures around the
world that didn't necessarily have
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge of one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So limonene is certainly one, but we also
have evidence for pining from pine nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I developed what I call THC
overdose meal, which would be pesto with
[SPEAKER_00]: the pine nuts and some basil, along with a
drink called limonada or agua limon,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like lemonade, but in this
instance, spiked with a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: extra lemon rind for that necessary
limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly if someone's had an overdose
of cannabis, they're not in a position to
[SPEAKER_00]: make this meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be best to have on hand or someone
else supplying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have somebody there to make you a meal
to help you come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a couple of questions that are
kind of just generally related to
[SPEAKER_01]: phyto-cannabinoids that I'd like to wrap
up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of them is that since the trichomes
are the home of the oils and the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenoids, it makes me think that
potentially a product that is just the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes, say for example, a hash or
something, would be able to be considered
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant medicine because it's all
there in the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I doubt that
interpretation because there aren't things
[SPEAKER_01]: like chlorophyll in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you see a dry hash, and I don't
mean extracted, I don't mean like butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about a dry sift hash or an
ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you consider those to be whole plant
medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the chlorophyll as an agent on
its own is mainly good as a laxative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, in terms of cannabis flowers,
the real medicinal part is the glandular
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome and its purest manifestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would be hashish, again, what Potter
called an enriched trichome preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is going to have the full
complement of the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might not have some other elements that
one would get from other parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants like canned flavin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, those can be had on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there was some discussion
and even some experiments in the mid 2000s
[SPEAKER_01]: that questioned the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the end, it was generally agreed
that the levels of CBD and other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and the doses that they were
using were too low to actually moderate
[SPEAKER_01]: the THC, kind of debunking those studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see as the required milligram
dosage of CBD to successfully play a role
[SPEAKER_01]: in the patient's experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it should be based on proportions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, some dispensaries have gotten
excited about very low levels of CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: despite its being so versatile and so
health promoting.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is not what you call really potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be a good amount there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, you want for a
preparation where there's going to be CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to at least as much as the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some instances, it's better to have
a lot more CBD than THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least a one to one and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is there a threshold for that where
the amount of CBD that you're intaking is
[SPEAKER_01]: too low to really have any effect at all
on you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would depend also on the absolute
amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, because it's so
overwhelming in its effects, one would
[SPEAKER_00]: base the overall dose on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put it in these terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two milligrams of THC as a threshold dose
are a good place to start for someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's not accustomed to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five milligrams is going to affect most
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten milligrams is a pretty large dose and
certainly may be too much for someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's cannabis naive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would be that amount of THC with
whatever amount of CBD is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be as much as 30 times as
much as THC with some of the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: chemovars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But say to treat a condition like
rheumatoid arthritis or schizophrenia or
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy, you need a much, much higher
dose of cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would that number be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Much, much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about 10 milligrams of CBD
a day or are you talking about 50?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it could be a few hundred milligrams
of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that becomes difficult to obtain and
can be quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these problems are byproducts
of prohibition and hopefully would be
[SPEAKER_00]: circumvented at some point in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say 100 milligrams of CBD in a
day is what's going to be called for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that you'd be able to
take all at once or would that just
[SPEAKER_01]: totally overwhelm your intake and you
actually would need to break that down
[SPEAKER_01]: into three doses over the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much can your body take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can take... In the recent
clinical trials of Epidiolex, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: almost pure CBD for seizure disorders,
they've used as much as 2,500 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD a day, but that's without any THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: To answer your question, generally
speaking, most types of cannabis and CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: should be dosed two or three times a day
if we're talking about orally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not just a matter of the total
overall daily dose but how it is
[SPEAKER_00]: apportioned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 2,500 milligrams is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that high dose, there can be some
drug-drug interactions, but at lower
[SPEAKER_00]: doses, those are quite rare with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a practical measure, though,
people are not using pure CBD and almost
[SPEAKER_00]: invariably there's going to be some amount
of THC that becomes the rate-limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: factor in what people can manage to take
without having issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings us to the hot question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're talking about how the market
is working and being able to afford CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: because CBD from medical cannabis remains
expensive because of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to set up this question where
I'm asking your thoughts on CBD derived
[SPEAKER_01]: from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as whole plant people,
we understand that without the
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents of the medical cannabis
plants, the minor cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: to create the entourage effect,
using CBD in isolate really does not get
[SPEAKER_01]: to claim the benefits of all the CBD
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you read these papers, they're
invariably CBD as the primary component in
[SPEAKER_01]: the presence of THC and minor
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet the CBD from hemp market is
claiming the advantages of these studies
[SPEAKER_01]: for their CBD in isolate plant from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: About CBD derived from hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have to be very critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a good source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not just talking about hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about hemp refuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the hemp has been
processed for another reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've done a chemical extraction to
concentrate the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, they're
concentrating pesticides or any other
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really not using dedicated flour
to produce the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the richest source and the
purest source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, because of prohibition,
there is not the quality control in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that would tell you whether this
is a good product or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to be quite critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I'm going to take that another
step and press a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree how that position suggests,
okay, we should not be buying CBD isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: from China.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because hemp is a wonderful toxin and
heavy metals aggregator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't know what you're going to be
buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some companies in Colorado now
that are growing environment controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp for extraction for medical products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're claiming that the ground is
clean and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we set aside the contamination
factor for a moment, do you think that it
[SPEAKER_01]: is reasonable at all to, and I know this
kind of goes back to the spiking idea,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let's say that you're taking some
amount of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting kind of like this bed of
THC, phyto cannabinoids, including all the
[SPEAKER_01]: minor ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also, because let's say you're a
rheumatoid arthritis patient, you need a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot of CBD as part of that mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there's any efficacy to
having that base from a whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, but then spike it with say 100
milligrams of CBD from hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's really suboptimal to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper medicine would stand on its own
merits, not need spiking from anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the capability is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proper chemovars are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're available everywhere at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I would hope for a better
future on which there are good quality
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled products available that are
backed by solid analyses so that consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: and physician alike can know what people
are getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, from a business point of view,
it sounds like CBD from hemp is a
[SPEAKER_01]: short-term product from a transitionary
market from prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the reason why it makes sense for
so many businesses to try to sell it is
[SPEAKER_01]: because whole plant medicine is still so
expensive because it's being controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ethan, is it true that you're working
on a follow-up to this paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely, as we speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when can we look forward to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be in a high bread
situation, advances in pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes out initially as a book,
but it'll also be available as an article.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be pretty extensive,
cover some of the same ground as taming
[SPEAKER_00]: THC with the cannabinoids, the terpenoids,
the cannabis flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll have a generous number of
terpenoids that were not treated in the
[SPEAKER_00]: prior paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the benefit of an additional five or
six years of research on some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: agents that we did discuss previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing that in collaboration with Jehan
Marku.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it'll be a nice entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping it'll be available later in
2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hopefully you'll accept my
invitation when your paper comes out to
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss it here on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be delighted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ethan, this has certainly been a lot
