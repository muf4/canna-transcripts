[SPEAKER_00]: To folks on the outside who are not
familiar with cannabis, the medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities of the plant can appear
overblown in a pipe dream, quite
[SPEAKER_00]: literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are right that most of us talk
about cannabis as a panacea because it
[SPEAKER_00]: does offer relief from so many bodily
ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those folks say, how can one herb fix
so many things in a human?
[SPEAKER_00]: That simply cannot be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is that cannabis really only
does one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It balances and strengthens and interacts
with the body's endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balancing and activating that one system
is a very big deal, though, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system touches all the
other mission-critical systems in the
[SPEAKER_00]: human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, though, not all humans
react to cannabis in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: By now, most cannabis users understand how
completely the terpene profile controls
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of euphoria that cannabis
gives us when it's smoked or vaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terpenes themselves influence humans
in differing ways, which is why some folks
[SPEAKER_00]: can smoke any and all equatorial
cultivars, while I have to be really picky
[SPEAKER_00]: with mine or I get a racing heart that I
find dysphoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have our very own personal and
individual relationship with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this is to say that cannabis helps
the endocannabinoid system of all humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But which cannabis cultivar used in which
way and at which dose are all variable
[SPEAKER_00]: from human to human.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really makes me cringe to see cannabis
folks arguing on social media about some
[SPEAKER_00]: patient's dosing protocol, because to
really understand how best to administer
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to a patient really takes a
pretty in-depth patient intake or some
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced self-awareness in
self-diagnosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks are usually arguing as if dosing is
the same for everyone, and it very much
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole plant cannabis medicine is a great
tool, and we need to recognize how to use
[SPEAKER_00]: it is dictated to a large degree by the
physical health, nutrition, expectations,
[SPEAKER_00]: mental health, and experience with
cannabis that the patient has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every cannabis patient is different and
deserves to be treated uniquely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn about cannabis
health, business, and technique
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently and with good cheer,

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Dr. Chris Spooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Spooner is a naturopathic doctor with
20 years clinical experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: specialties in gastrointestinal and
integrative medicine, among others.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been a board member and vice chair
of the College of Naturopathic Physicians
[SPEAKER_00]: of British Columbia since 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Spooner is presently on the medical
advisory boards of several integrative
[SPEAKER_00]: care and cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with all of that, Chris still keeps
an active presence of private clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: practice at Paradigm Integrative Medicine,
helping real people every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're gonna discuss the wide range
of variables at play in the human body to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider when making cannabis
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we talk about those
body variables and how unique each human
[SPEAKER_00]: is when it comes to cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second set, we review the
analytical tools and tests we can use when
[SPEAKER_00]: performing a patient intake or serious
self-diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the third set, we talk about easy
to access whole foods that you can eat to
[SPEAKER_00]: support a thriving endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Shango, great to be here,
thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by giving everybody a
really good idea of the variables at play
[SPEAKER_00]: when discussing the use of cannabis
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, humans are not at all the same,
even though textbooks about the human body
[SPEAKER_00]: and the discussion of the endocannabinoid
system may seem to suggest that they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start, would you please give us a
sense of the variety of health variables
[SPEAKER_00]: that could potentially impact the use of
cannabis medicine and should be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: when choosing how best to use cannabis to
relieve ailments?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, super interesting question,
you know, and this definitely falls within
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of, you know, my integrated medicine,
functional medicine, naturopathic medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't, you know, this is an approach
that I use pretty much with all my
[SPEAKER_02]: patients, whether it be cannabis medicine
or not, you know, and essentially,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what we're really trying to do
is, is recognize that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got individual patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one of the challenges that we
have with medicine right now is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that, you know, we're, we're using
evidence-based medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to protocols and
standardization part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and what we've forgotten is,
is that we're kind of creating medicine by
[SPEAKER_02]: average.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was just having this
conversation with a patient yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was showing them some data set,
you know, and some slides saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, well, you know, and here's this nice
graph line down the middle of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but you know, when you take a
look at the number of points, data points
[SPEAKER_02]: that are actually on the best fit line,
there's only four and the other 150 or
[SPEAKER_02]: above or below.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that starts to become something that's
become a real sort of foundation on how I
[SPEAKER_02]: work, you know, with, with patients on
this, which is, you know, we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: recognize and we've got to really dig into
these unique aspects of patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, when I start off,
there's a couple of things that I take a
[SPEAKER_02]: look at first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, it's sort of a base of
a pyramid and which ones, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: each one sort of successively builds on
the next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, to me, you know,
optimizing nutrition is, is gotta be key
[SPEAKER_02]: in this, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so, you know, I think that,
you know, when you start looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids and the endocannabinoids in
particular, you know, all of these things
[SPEAKER_02]: are basically, you know, built off fats,
you know, in our body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, our, our, you know,
the macronutrient part of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the omega threes, omega six, you know,
saturated fat status of our diets becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really important, you know,
because I think we need to remember the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system is a homeostatic
regulatory system, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means that, you know, you can only
push it so far versus the other,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's actually a balancing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're trying to create a super
intense therapeutic effect on that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to cap that out at
both, you know, both ends of that along
[SPEAKER_02]: the continuum of, you know, one extreme
versus the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to look at ways to build
capacity within that and try to unload it
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we allow the endocannabinoid
system to balance as opposed to push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you move on, you've, we're not even
three minutes into the show and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: already blown my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you, did you just say that if our
nutrition is lacking, the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy will only be able to do so much
because our body won't have the capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: to properly use the cannabis we're
introducing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that, you know, and so that's,
you know, you can carry that three theme
[SPEAKER_02]: through a whole, a whole, the whole range
of things that I'm suggesting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, if we start off, like I said,
with optimizing the nutrition,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and, and again, I mean,
you can talk about things like fats and
[SPEAKER_02]: protein status and amino acids and such,
you know, if we talk about micronutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I mean, there's, you know,
the area that I do a lot of work with,
[SPEAKER_02]: with my patients is nutrigenomics,
you know, so we'll use like the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the 23andMe platforms, one we tend to use
the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, you know, some people have
concerns about that for a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: different reasons, mostly about where
their health data and things like that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going in, but it certainly is accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, that's a whole other
conversation we could have, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly within that, you see variability
within patient populations on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, again, how they, you know,
build different parts of things that
[SPEAKER_02]: intersect with the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and those are things that can be
modulated again, macronutrient and
[SPEAKER_02]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's probably,
you know, again, that's a fairly deep dive
[SPEAKER_02]: into, okay, what's the diet that you're
looking at, you know, let's take a look at
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the physical science and symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at various different nutrient
deficiencies, you know, and that starts to
[SPEAKER_02]: become part of the conversation and basic,
you know, history building, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that that's, you know, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next thing, you know, we take a look at is
hormones and hormones build off of your
[SPEAKER_02]: nutritional status as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you know, what we're talking
estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we could move into some of the
neurotransmitter part of that as well too,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, where they're talking dopamine,
you know, serotonin, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: epinephrine, norepinephrine cortisol
levels, all of those have huge interplays,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, with regards to, you know,
effects on metabolism and blood glucose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so again, you know, you need to have,
you know, if your carbohydrate metabolism,
[SPEAKER_02]: blood sugars off, you know, is that,
you know, an impact on cortisol or
[SPEAKER_02]: response to altered cortisol status and
adrenal function.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so again, you know, that's your
dietary habits start to build in on that
[SPEAKER_02]: as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that starts to become the next part
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think we also take a look.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we look at the, the nutrigenomics
part of this, you know, things like you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, catechol, like dopamine,
for example, is a catecholamine,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and it's, you know, it's
impacted by a whole host of network of
[SPEAKER_02]: different, you know, estrogen metabolism,
cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine,
[SPEAKER_02]: and those build on again, various
different micronutrients like B vitamins
[SPEAKER_02]: and methylation status on neurotransmitter
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So suddenly now you're seeing this
intersection here and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how those hormones and neurotransmitters
are cleared out of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Particularly through something called
catechol-O-methyltransferase, which is an
[SPEAKER_02]: enzyme that's the, the warrior versus the
warrior phenotype, if anybody's been
[SPEAKER_02]: following that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has, in my experience has
significant implications for
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid tone and response,
you know, and, and furthermore,
[SPEAKER_02]: it probably explains to a large extent
what's going on, you know, with,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, the gender differences that
we see, you know, how women versus males
[SPEAKER_02]: respond differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And largely that has a significant,
you know, interplay with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: estrogen metabolism and impacts on
dopamine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that starts to become
something that's super, super interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that element of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the next stage that I start
taking a look at is, is the
[SPEAKER_02]: gastrointestinal tract.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do tons of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, it's one of the areas that I
work outside of cannabis medicine with
[SPEAKER_02]: several other companies with, which is on
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so that suddenly ties in
hugely with our, you know, endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's some really interesting
research that takes a look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system as kind of the
intersection between the gut microbiome,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and the gut brain access and the
implications of that on endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system functioning are fascinating as well
too, you know, so this becomes something
[SPEAKER_02]: that, again, when you base it on our
nutrition, I mean, the types of fibers
[SPEAKER_02]: that we start to make, like for example,
if we wanted to dig down into this a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more, and again, we can,
obviously we've got some, some wine times
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll probably find a skitter round
over places, but you know, let's take a
[SPEAKER_02]: look at something like GABA.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the endocannabinoid system,
you know, the CB1 receptors are,
[SPEAKER_02]: are, you know, I mean, they, they have
significant impacts on GABA and glutamate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those are the excitatory
inhibitory neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the interesting things is,
is if we take a look at the gut
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome, you know, butyrate is a short
chain fatty acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody who's ever smelled rancid butter,
you know, that's, you know, that's
[SPEAKER_02]: butyrate, or that's butyrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but it's produced by, you know,
the microbiome and the large intestine,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the, the bacteroidy species of
bacteria that colonize the large
[SPEAKER_02]: intestine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets it by fermenting different
types of fibers, particularly things like
[SPEAKER_02]: psyllium powder and an oat bran are two
big sources of it as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several others as well,
but that's what I use predominantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And butyrate is actually the building
block for GABA, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamma amino butyric acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So butyrate butyric.
[SPEAKER_02]: So suddenly now you're taking a look at
one of the major, you know, sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory neurotransmitters within the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the significant component of it
is being generated in our gastrointestinal
[SPEAKER_02]: tracts by a microbiome and the type of
fiber that we eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So suddenly that, you know, has huge
implications on this as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that becomes a really significant
element.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I do seminars for for
continuing medical education for patients
[SPEAKER_02]: on, on gut ecology and gut microbiome and
how that works and intersects with immune
[SPEAKER_02]: function and T cell polarization and this
type of thing as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some, some really interesting
intersections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you know, when we start talking
about endocannabinoids, you only start
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about anti-inflammatory effects,
the effects, you know, how much of that is
[SPEAKER_02]: this intersection with gut microbiome and
T cell polarization through, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: mucus associated in lymphoid tissue and
this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's that part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My past work was in environmental
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent, I did a postdoctorate down at
Phoenix at the Southwest college of
[SPEAKER_02]: naturopathic medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We created a environmental medicine
center, center of excellence, Dr. Walter
[SPEAKER_02]: Crinian, who you guys actually probably up
in the Washington state area would know
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was quite highly regarded for
environmental medicine, had a very large
[SPEAKER_02]: clinic up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had the opportunity to spend a
lot of time and learn from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we got to spend,
you know, things like working with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Phoenix fire department and setting up a
wellness center and working at sort of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, getting heavy metals out of guys
that went to hurricane Katrina,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, nine 11 and stuff and trying to
get rid of, you know, various different
[SPEAKER_02]: toxins and the implications on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that part became part of these
detoxification pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly in that work, I mean,
that's probably where I ended up getting a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of my, my, my interest in,
in genomics, cause we were taking a look
[SPEAKER_02]: at genetic variation and cytochrome P four
50 enzymes, which are the enzymes that
[SPEAKER_02]: clear out a large, you know, the
significant amount of what we call
[SPEAKER_02]: xenobiotics or, you know, chemicals within
the environment, how those things get out
[SPEAKER_02]: of our system is run through the liver,
which is this big filter, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and so that has implications on drug
metabolism and how that clears out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and again, when we took a look
at environmental pollutants, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like solvent exposures and
pesticides and heavy metals, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what we looked at is that had,
you know, three sort of areas that they
[SPEAKER_02]: affected neurological immune function and
endocrine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, suddenly when we start
taking a look at the impacts of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, environmental compounds and
these xenobiotics, you know, and how that
[SPEAKER_02]: starts to impact, you know, hepatic
function and clearance and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how genetic polymorphisms and
variations start to impact that then
[SPEAKER_02]: suddenly again, you know, I mean,
suddenly there's all sorts of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, connections and intersections
happening with endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and certainly, you know,
I mean, you know, Ethan, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Russell and I were just doing that
work on, you know, the genetics of a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis hyperemesis syndrome,
you know, and, and in what we were seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: in there was, you know, some genetic
variants on some of these drug clearance
[SPEAKER_02]: pathways, you know, which again,
intersects with pharmacogenomics and
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially, you know, this environmental
medicine type thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and certainly, you know, one of the things
that I look at in the work that I've done
[SPEAKER_02]: with some of the licensed producers up
here in Canada, you know, as we've really
[SPEAKER_02]: tried to emphasize, Hey, look,
pesticides are a problem, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but even especially with hemp,
for example, I mean, one of the things I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that gets, you know, missed a little
bit is that hemp is a bioaccumulator of
[SPEAKER_02]: cadmium, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so now you're going to have
to start taking a look and paying
[SPEAKER_02]: attention and those, those heavy metals
need to be looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially when we're doing
concentrates, you know, is that starting
[SPEAKER_02]: to be something and cadmium is a fairly
nasty metal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has some significant implications,
particularly on estrogen metabolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's your detoxification pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so for those who are keeping score at
home, I'm seeing four variables so far
[SPEAKER_00]: that you delineated that you talk to your
patients about as you are moving towards
[SPEAKER_00]: your diagnosis and figuring out cannabis
protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one being, what is the state of
their nutrition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have to have the capacity to
be able to intake the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two was hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three was the status of their GI tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And four would be environmental influences
that might be acting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go into those any more depth,
is there more on that list?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so a couple of things that I want to
focus on, which just glowed in your
[SPEAKER_00]: answers, but I didn't want to interrupt
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so the first thing is, is you
mentioned with, you know, some amount of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of coarseness to it, that there are gender
differences when it comes to using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is just not a lot being talked
about on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you go into that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, where do we start on this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how about, um, um, how do the
health, how do the health benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: using cannabinoid medicine differ between
men and women and others?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, there's a couple of different areas
that I would look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I guess where I was trying to think
is there's, is how do we put this into a
[SPEAKER_02]: logical framework that makes sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think where I'd probably start with
this, we, we see different responses,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like women in general have different
responses to dopamine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's a large factor because
dopamine and estrogen get cleared out
[SPEAKER_02]: through this, this calm T enzyme,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so what tends to happen is,
is that, uh, this system can be
[SPEAKER_02]: overloaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it becomes, you know,
has to clear out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually use the analogy of we've got a
kitchen sink and then what's, what's the
[SPEAKER_02]: size of the drain and the kitchen sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within that sink, we're pouring in
these various different hormones and
[SPEAKER_02]: neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so obviously for women as estrogen
levels, you know, start to rise,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you're going to have a more
significant capacity consumed by the
[SPEAKER_02]: clearance of those, you know, that
particular hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what are the implications on that
for other neurotransmitters and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like dopamine, for example?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, I think that, that by,
you know, it has some significant
[SPEAKER_02]: implications on, you know, how women
respond to it, you know, how they utilize
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dosing strategies and then it's,
it's not, I mean, I couldn't say
[SPEAKER_02]: definitively, I'd have to spend time with
each particular patient to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: identify, you know, what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, you know, some women,
um, either through nutritional
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies or genetic variants don't
clear out estrogen as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they either have a smaller drain
or what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that has implications on mood,
which, you know, I mean, I don't think I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking out of turn here, but anybody
who's in a relationship will have noticed
[SPEAKER_02]: that sometimes, you know, moods,
moods change a little bit throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that has a lot in my experience
to do with, again, you know, how these
[SPEAKER_02]: estrogen metabolites are either
accumulating cause there's, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple different, you know, um,
metabolites of estrogen based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: molecular structure, what we call two
hydroxy, four hydroxy and 16 I hydroxy
[SPEAKER_02]: alpha, um, estrogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each one has a slightly different
effect and pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as those are kind of consuming up
different capacity of com T, then that
[SPEAKER_02]: starts to shift around, you know,
the, the dopamine metabolism and can lead
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, again, mood anxiety,
you know, uh, headaches, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pain, cramping and this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I think that that's, you know,
just, just from a standpoint of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of how you deal, you know, with women's
health and gynecological health,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's, you know, those estrogen
metabolites in that pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we start taking a look at,
at the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, we see intersection there through,
you know, uh, serotonin pathways and
[SPEAKER_02]: dopamine pathways in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then furthermore, you know,
things like, you know, the menstrual cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: is regulated through prostaglandins and
prostaglandins are, um, again,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, uh, built out of the types of
fats that we have are omega three,
[SPEAKER_02]: six and nine saturated fats, arachidonic
acid, and this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those prostaglandins have a
significant impact on the lining of the
[SPEAKER_02]: uterus of the endometrium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, so, you know, they help,
you know, shut off and open a small blood
[SPEAKER_02]: vessels that are involved in menses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the, again, one of the
things that we work a lot with women is
[SPEAKER_02]: taking a look at your essential fatty acid
status.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I think the logical
extension of that is, well, let's take a
[SPEAKER_02]: look at what happens with the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, you know, we see that,
you know, um, you know, various different
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids like PEA and,
and this type of thing have an impact on,
[SPEAKER_02]: on uterine proliferation, endometrial
cirrhosis, ovarian cysts and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I think that's, you know,
probably, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good snapshot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, listening to you describe
this, you know, on, on one hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the detail in your answer is
remarkable because I swear I talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis researchers all the time and I do
not get this level of detailed answer from
[SPEAKER_00]: most anybody, which, you know,
is impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also at the same time,
as somebody who works with patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, daily, um, it also is kind of
frustrating because I'm like, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this is the, the more,
the more sentences you say, Chris,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more complex the, the diagnosis seems
to become about what cannabinoids we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use to offer relief and
strengthening to which part of the human.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can even use the other
cannabinoids with the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: element that we're actually targeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there's so many, there's so
many layers and then it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so many people poo poo,
the idea of how much good cannabis does
[SPEAKER_00]: here, like, Oh, people think it solves
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like, you know, all right,
it doesn't solve everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It solves one thing, the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is that's the body's,
um, thermostat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it touches all of the mission
critical systems in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, cannabis does really well with
this one system, but it's the master
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, yeah, it actually does help
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that makes it such a beneficial
herb at the same time as a caregiver who's
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to this show, I can imagine it
can feel kind of, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: defeating in a way where who's got the
amount of information about their,
[SPEAKER_00]: about their patient and the time to talk
with them about all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we're going to talk more in the
second set about the analytics you use,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, but just speaking to the bigger idea
of the complexity of this really suggests
[SPEAKER_00]: to me that we have just scratched the
surface of endocannabinoid medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I think this is the, I mean,
this speaks to such a larger issue,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, which is, is what is healthcare
and what is disease care?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, and like I said,
I mean, I'm, I'm integrative, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of my my naturopathic doctor
friends shrieking or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I prescribe stuff and things like
that, and a lot of my medical doctor
[SPEAKER_02]: friends shrieking or when I start talking
about, you know, holistic approaches and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look at myself as a bridge,
you know, I try very much to be very
[SPEAKER_02]: grounded in science, you know,
but I also recognize that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a role, you have to use
the right tool, you know, you have to,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you have to also have enough
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our healthcare system at this time,
you know, struggles, and especially up
[SPEAKER_02]: here in Canada, I've talked with many,
many of my medical doctor friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and, and we have, you know,
we have medicine where doctors are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, paid by the government and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, to a large extent,
and again, I practice in the U S you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine is, is determined, you know,
on, on this sort of fee for service model,
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means that, okay, well, if you see
more patients, you make more revenue out
[SPEAKER_02]: of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, and the efforts around
evidence based medicine and to do these
[SPEAKER_02]: things are to try and create a structured
framework to do that, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, it's really helpful when,
you know, you're in an emergency room,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're crashing, and you're having a
heart attack, or you've been in a motor
[SPEAKER_02]: vehicle accident, or you've crashed or
something like that as well, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these are things where,
you know, are super important to have
[SPEAKER_02]: these things that can be acted on quickly
and rapidly and be very, very effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the model starts to break down as we
get more and more into these individual,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, into individual care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, what I struggle
with, and what I try and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my small, small voice in the wilderness
here is to say, like, hey, everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can't just be about cannabis,
it actually needs to be about the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, like I said, cannabis is an
incredible tool, it's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we, you know, we've talked in our
previous conversations is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I kind of come from that as
saying, like, you know, cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: remarkably easy to do something with,
because it actually works, you can see it
[SPEAKER_02]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, try to deal with, you know,
the sort of poking and prodding of some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the other herbal medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that becomes, you know,
it's more difficult, it's more nuanced on
[SPEAKER_02]: this as well, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, but what I struggle with
here a little bit is that I see cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of being moved into sort of like,
well, THC and CBD, what's the dose,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's the prescribing and all this that
we move into what I call sort of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I'm not the only one,
I certainly didn't coin this term,
[SPEAKER_02]: but green allopathy, which is,
well, let's just find a green alternative
[SPEAKER_02]: for the medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll use willow bark or curcumin for
aspirin, there's an anti-inflammatory or
[SPEAKER_02]: will you choose whatever one sort of goes
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you know, I think, you know,
trying to bring this patient centered
[SPEAKER_02]: focus back into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's, you know, that's what
sort of drew me to the endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabis system was we started to see
patients responding quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, being able to work fairly,
you know, on their own, to be able to sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of manage their own healthcare through
accessing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's sort of like, you know,
my job that I kind of look at is,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, let's bring in some of these other
stuff that's been, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what I'm talking about here
isn't new within sort of the integrative
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine naturopathic community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just nobody has ever overlaid it on
the endocannabinoid system in this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so, you know, it's just,
like I said, my role as a bridge is to try
[SPEAKER_02]: and sort of bring that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you know, I mean, for patients
that have itself, I think most people have
[SPEAKER_02]: a good sense of, you know, how do I
optimize nutrition?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we sat down and said,
okay, what's a healthy diet look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most people could tell us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would say like, well,
just recognize how important that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not, and not only just in using that
in cannabis, but again, also trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: make your cannabis work better for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, and, you know, again,
are we, do we, as clinicians and people,
[SPEAKER_02]: do we want to keep someone on a medication
forever, whether it be cannabis or a
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical or herbal medicine,
or do we want to try and build the
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity where patients can take control
of their health?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm out there exercising.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting blood pumping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing my exercise routine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm eating healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my diet cleared up as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And does that start to say I use my
cannabis to kind of help me get to a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain space and now I can use it either
less frequently or at certain situations
[SPEAKER_02]: because I have the resiliency because I
built on these other aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so another thing that you mentioned
that I found very engaging is this phrase
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm going to start using all the time
of medicine by average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, I know that there are
doctors and caregivers who are listening,
[SPEAKER_00]: who run into this every day because,
you know, first off, just because we work
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis, um, at least up until
normalization has begun, the vast majority
[SPEAKER_00]: of patients that we come in contact with,
they are already not the average.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the fringe because by the time
that people get to cannabis medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've usually already tried everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: else, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of like, you know, everybody's
parents and grandparents now using,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, topicals and, and, you know,
edibles for their aches and pains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really something that has just
come into acceptance again, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more recently as there are more
recreational stores around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but, you know, in the, in the
transition years that we're in and
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly in the heritage market,
by the time people got to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, Western medicine had already given up
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so by its very, you know,
nature of the prohibition years,
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone we got was generally not average.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were on the fringe because regular
medicine didn't work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we've got that set of patients,
but then also we've got all these new
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, which, uh, you know,
since, since cannabis medicine can help
[SPEAKER_00]: just about everybody, um, you know,
there's, there's all these people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: served by Western medicine, who are now
also being served by kinematic care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, um, I find it both, you know,
informative and troubling that the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine by average really is to the
advantage of the, the health industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: the, and the patient care industry and not
the, the healthcare industry as you made
[SPEAKER_00]: that delineation earlier about,
about medicine for health versus medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep you alive, to sell you more
medicine.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, this idea of medicine by average
is so frustrating to so many caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not expecting you to have an answer
for it because it's, it's, it's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a difficult paradoxical thing,
but, but what kind of advice would you
[SPEAKER_00]: give to caregivers who are dealing with
this, trying to provide individualized
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine in a system that does medicine by
average?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, and again, you know,
I'm so steeped in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, you know, again, I had this
conversation with a patient the other day
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and they're like, Oh my God,
this is so frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, Oh, this is just the ocean
that we kind of swim in as naturopathic
[SPEAKER_02]: physicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that, you know,
is why people come and seek us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that this is the amazing
about, you know, podcasts like this in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world that we live in now is that people
are starting to, you know, learn more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, just, just like, you know,
I think about my own experience and
[SPEAKER_02]: figuring out cannabis and, you know,
the, the people that I've worked with and
[SPEAKER_02]: just the giants that I've, I've had the
opportunity to, to learn from,
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but my, my, my own learning was
accelerated that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think at the end of the day,
you know, being, you know, your own
[SPEAKER_02]: advocate, um, and starting to sort of say
like, Hey, wait a second, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some questions about this and about
that, you know, that's, that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's key.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the most important part of
it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the hardest part is,
yeah, how do you find a clinician that
[SPEAKER_02]: works, you know, that's saying like,
well, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't, I certainly can't answer you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm always surprised that some of
the doctors that are super open to this
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of that aren't, you know,
I mean, I just had a super interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation with a rheumatologist down
there your way in Seattle, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing really cool stuff with a heart rate
variability and autoimmune illnesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were coming at this from two
different ways, but the intersection was
[SPEAKER_02]: remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, okay, I've met some
rheumatologists and it can be pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: conservative, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so suddenly, you know, to have them
move outside of this is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you know, again, I couldn't tell
you how, but I think certainly,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think most doctors are seeking,
you know, that relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the, the, um, the epidemic of
physician burnout that we have has a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: to do with the loss of sort of the doctor
patient relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, doctors are seeing that as much
as anyone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I mean, you,
you have to, you're going to have to sort
[SPEAKER_02]: through a bunch of different physicians
perhaps until you find one that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that has that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I, but I do sympathize with a lot
of those doctors and certainly,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the ones that I know socially
versus I know professionally, sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a bit of a, uh, incongruity
between the people I know them to be and
[SPEAKER_02]: how they're working in their space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I try and approach that with some
compassion and, and, and, and sympathy of
[SPEAKER_02]: how they're doing and go from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I don't, I don't know if I
necessarily have an answer on them to say
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the advocate, you know, understand
your patient, your doctor is, is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: struggling in a lot of different ways
around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and reach out and try and engage in
conversation and you'll find some that do
[SPEAKER_02]: and some that don't, which is,
you know, maybe horribly naive,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's what I'll put out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, we're going to take a short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be right back and, um, make sure you
do come back because after the break,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, we are going to be talking about some
of the, um, analytics that are available
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a good snapshot of your body or
your patient's body so that you can start
[SPEAKER_00]: to thread the needle of individualized
cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is naturopathic
physician, Chris Spooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert biological systems has the
beneficial insects, mites and nematodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbials, sticky cards, and air
distribution units, you need to partner
[SPEAKER_00]: with nature to defend your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_00]: from chemical sprays towards clean and
natural solutions.

[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an auto flowering cannabis
enthusiast, this event's for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Announcing the 2021 Auto Flower Cup,
August 6th, 7th, and 8th in Lillooup,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, just outside of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Presented by Camp Ruderalis, this
gathering has something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Auto Flower Cup competition,
of course, but it's so much more than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a Stunden glass hookah lounge,
a pop-up magical butter chocolate shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: and waterfront marketplace with an array
of vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be an old school auto flower
seed swap joint rolling competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cooking demos, solventless
squishing demos, and late night
[SPEAKER_00]: documentary screenings of both Doast and
Fantastic Fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: The food will be lit too, including Chef
Sebastian Carossi's award-winning classics
[SPEAKER_00]: like elk chili, Kobe beef kimchi dogs,
oyster po' boys, and razor clam chowder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy the campfire chili and oyster
chowder cook-off, wild oyster harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom foraging, and s'mores around the
campfires each night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each day there, Dan Jimmy of Mandalorian
will teach about auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there will be presentations on closet
cultivation and hunting for psilocybin
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The competition is open to everyone,
commercial and home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a category for photo period
plants too, so check out the
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowercup2021.com for those details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, there will be plenty of cannabis
around, but due to state law, it won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: supplied by the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there will be easy public toking,
which is why this is a strictly over 2021
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can camp, rent a cabin, or stay at a
local Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glamping and RV packages are available
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to say that Shaping Fire is a
sponsor of the event, and I'll be there
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to connecting with other
auto flower fans like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get all the details at
theautoflowercup2021.com and follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram at theautoflowercup2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll see you in August at Auto Flower
Cup when we bring the auto flower family
[SPEAKER_00]: together to celebrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I love growing under the sun,
there's a lot of good reasons to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're like most folks,
you want a lighting source that grows
[SPEAKER_00]: high-yielding, healthy plants without
using excessive amounts of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS lighting creates biological lighting
solutions that brings the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliance of the outdoors into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS lighting has the attributes that I
look for in a horticultural lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bought those cheap lights online,
and they're difficult to work with and
[SPEAKER_00]: fail in no time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, my BIOS LED light is
industrial-grade to last a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is IP66 wet-rated, so little foliar
overspray won't harm it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easy to clean without taking it
down, and of course, the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect, it is built for the exact light
spectrum I want for great-yielding,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't hurt that their lighting
rigs look badass too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many horticultural LED lighting systems
are based on irrelevant performance
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics, and people love to argue online
about these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to judge on PAR photon efficiency
and how happy my plants are, and the BIOS
[SPEAKER_00]: lights exceed my expectations in these
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS lights have an optimized broad
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth, while also providing the
ideal conditions for superior PAR efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: and a comfortable visual experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love their attentive and
over-educated customer service folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS starts with a team of biologists
before getting the electrical engineers
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have studied how light impacts
cannabis plants and devised an overall
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to check out their website
at bioslighting.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: how this strategy can work for you.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shangolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our guest this week is naturopathic
physician, Chris Spooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we focused on the
different variables that can significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: impact the patient's use of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the second set, we're going to
try to figure out how we suss out which of
[SPEAKER_00]: these variables we need to be able to pay
the most attention to when either doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: self-assessment as a patient who is trying
to self-heal or as a doctor or caregiver
[SPEAKER_00]: who is working with a patient and you want
to give them the best individualized
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Chris, I guess take us from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a new patient and you've got
their questionnaire in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from our prior talks, I know that
there is, I'll call it a battery of tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's that many,
but there are some tests that you rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you your basic information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've all had blood tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we start there, something
that people have got a frame of reference
[SPEAKER_00]: with, and then continue on through the
other analytics that you give your
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is going to fluctuate a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to fluctuate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll give that caveat before we get
started here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly I may segue into one or two
of those if we need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think when we're starting off,
there's a number of things to factor here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, what type of testing does
a clinician or a patient have access to?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think probably what I try and do is
start off with the very basics,
[SPEAKER_02]: basic blood work, blood chemistry,
you know, CBC, like compete, complete
[SPEAKER_02]: blood counts, you know, liver function
tests, you know, thyroid, these,
[SPEAKER_02]: these sort of standard things that you can
get from any of your, your medical
[SPEAKER_02]: doctors, you know, or naturopathic
physicians or, or, you know, these are
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's, that's a nice,
easy one to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's relatively inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, so I think this is a good
place to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, what I do is I kind of break
this down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we starting with the model or the
framework that I suggested about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, taking a look at sort of
optimizing nutrition here a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's a couple of markers that
you can take a look at within a basic
[SPEAKER_02]: blood work that can give you a general
sense of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, you know, we could start
off with is someone anemic or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so a lot of patients may come in
with fatigue and, you know, exhaustion
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, and, and fatigue is a
pretty, you know, it's a pretty broad
[SPEAKER_02]: based indicator, but you know,
I mean, we can sort of see is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what's your iron status looking
like, you know, cause I mean, sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: you just need to make sure that you're
checking off some of the basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause sometimes there's a tendency to,
you know, to, to rush off into more
[SPEAKER_02]: exotic, you know, the analysis is,
you know, when we hear hooves think of
[SPEAKER_02]: horses, not zebras, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then the qualifiers unless
you're in Africa, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so there's some contextual component to
that as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, so certainly just taking a
look at, you know, what your, your red
[SPEAKER_02]: blood cell counts, hematocrit hemoglobin
is, and just making sure you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: running anemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But within that, you know, one of the ones
that I like to pay attention to is a
[SPEAKER_02]: fairly, it's a decent indicator of things
like, vitamin B12 and folic acid status
[SPEAKER_02]: is, is what's called the MCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the mean corpuscular volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is basically, you know,
the, the size of your red blood cells,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and, and usually, I mean,
the old term for it was a pernicious
[SPEAKER_02]: anemia, which, you know, then we'd give
people B12 shots to try and bring it
[SPEAKER_02]: around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this MCV was a little bit elevated up
here in Canada, I think we're using the
[SPEAKER_02]: same unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these will vary a little bit,
but usually it's above 97.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget what the number is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just forget the, the units.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that usually being
suggested, these blood cells are a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and the reason that this one's
important from an endocannabinoid status
[SPEAKER_02]: is, is if we go back to this sort of,
you know, calm T pathway that I was sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of speaking to a little bit earlier,
you know, the B vitamins, particularly,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, folic acid, B12, B6,
and that are involved in this thing called
[SPEAKER_02]: a methylation pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and this methylation pathway is one
of these things that creates a compound
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that, you know, supports calm T,
S-adenosyl methionine in particular is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the one it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but those, your B, your folic acid
and your B12 have to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: have this little methyl group.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little carbon with three hydrogens
onto it, added to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get these methylated B vitamins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for, for people that are in
the know about nutrition, nutritional
[SPEAKER_02]: supplementation, we, most people tend to
use methylated forms of folic acid and B12
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're active and we know that
these genetic variants aren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly if we see the MCV starting
to be up there a little bit, it starts to
[SPEAKER_02]: become something like, well, maybe we need
to take a look at the B12 status or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or take a look at, you know, supplementing
someone with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the other part of this is,
is that pernicious anemia often had
[SPEAKER_02]: something to do with gastric inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: B12s absorbed, there's a co-factor for it
in the lining of the gut that helps get it
[SPEAKER_02]: absorbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's irritation to the lining of
the stomach, you know, certainly that can
[SPEAKER_02]: compromise absorption as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things like acid blocker medications
and that can have impacts on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so that's the one of the, you know,
a nice place to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're seeing that MCV being a
little bit elevated, well, maybe we need
[SPEAKER_02]: to take a look at that sort of the
absorption of B12 and its various
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we start working down a little bit
more, a couple of the other markers that I
[SPEAKER_02]: start to take a look in there,
you know, I take, I like to take a look at
[SPEAKER_02]: the white blood cell counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this speaks to a larger element
that's, that's we need to have a quick
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation about, which is about what
are reference ranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause this very much speaks to our last
thing of, you know, medicine by average,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so I think people need to
understand that reference ranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you, when you get a lab test,
it gives you the number, like for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: CV is 91 and with it, you're given a
reference range that is 88 through 97,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you look at that and you're like,
Oh, well, that must mean that I'm healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: within this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you could be, or you couldn't,
but you need to understand that that
[SPEAKER_02]: reference range refers to a population
norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what you're looking at is
sort of a, you know, kind of a 95% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tests fall within value A and value B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of which there's an upper and lower range,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that really speaks to this sort of
medicine by average.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always sort of been like,
well, if you're one of these people that
[SPEAKER_02]: tends to be up at the upper end of a
value, you know, and you drop 10 points,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, do you feel as bad as a person
who's at the lower end of the value and
[SPEAKER_02]: drops 10 points, you know, and,
you know, but one of those falls within
[SPEAKER_02]: the reference range and one of them
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where this individualized
medicine goes, where you need to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: start to ask some patients, some
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: About this and in thyroid testing is
notorious for this, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can see some patients,
you know, they just have a range that they
[SPEAKER_02]: feel much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sometimes is inside the reference
range and sometimes outside of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hold on before you continue on
another thing that you just said about the
[SPEAKER_00]: reference range that just surprised me,
unless I misunderstood, you said that the
[SPEAKER_00]: reference range comes from the averages of
the tests that are taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that means that if I population is
getting increasingly unhealthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the reference range will change as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, for example, in my country,
you know, obesity is a scourge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our reference ranges that are
attached to obesity would be theoretically
[SPEAKER_00]: moving in the wrong directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also, since it's happening to so
many people, our reference range is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually drifting with the population's
lack of health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, potentially, you know, and I think,
you know, and for some of these tests,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's a long history of what
we know, like, you know, blood lipids and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that, you know, that it's
like, okay, well, we know that these
[SPEAKER_02]: issues, you know, I mean, there's a fairly
long history of what this looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they're a little bit more
resistant to that trending in that
[SPEAKER_02]: respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I don't disagree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for like, for example,
again, let's go back to thyroid a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because again, there's a lot of
interpretation on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's other factors that start to
come into this, you know, the thyroid,
[SPEAKER_02]: the it's interesting up here in Canada,
you know, the depending on the lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: the upper limit of that is is 5.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that if you cross the border
down and into Washington State there,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the American College for
endocrinology has kind of set it as like
[SPEAKER_02]: under 2.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a significant difference on
where you're classified as, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hypothyroid or thyroid, and it may not
necessarily be the test so much as what
[SPEAKER_02]: the impact is on your clinician's mindset
as to whether this is an issue or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So someone that's looking at a reference
range of up to five, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say like, Whoa, okay, your
thyroid, your TSH level sitting at 4.5,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas a physician may not, you know,
who's used to seeing it at five,
[SPEAKER_02]: whereas someone who's trained,
you know, or in a different jurisdiction,
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's slightly different may look at
that and be like, Oh yeah, no,
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, you know, that, you know,
you need to be under 2.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you've got two things there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is certainly the issue that you're
speaking to, but the other one is also the
[SPEAKER_02]: clinician's mindset and how they start to
prioritize what to look like, which I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's probably a little bit more,
I don't know if insidious is the word,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's the one that comes to mind
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so far we've been talking about
the blood test because that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're all kind of familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all seen our ranges and we could
probably do an entire show just talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, uh, blood test and how to go
through each aspect of it and how it could
[SPEAKER_00]: impact the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for today, let's, let's move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think that, I think that both
patients and caregivers have gotten a good
[SPEAKER_00]: taste of, of what there could be to
unearth in a blood test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know that I, I'm going to go
back and look at my recent blood work with
[SPEAKER_00]: whole new eyes now, but let's move on to
the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so what other analytics do you,
um, do look at to help get that snapshot
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you know, in what ways to diagnose
and give protocol to a patient?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the next one is that's the
biggest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, and we touched on this is,
is healthy hormones, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, what, what, and I tend to use a
lot of, um, questionnaires around this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we can probably go quite some
time on this, but certainly, like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when I'm taking a look at this
where I've been spending a lot of time
[SPEAKER_02]: with patients, I don't know whether it's
just the patient population that's coming
[SPEAKER_02]: in right at this moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but certainly the world that we live
in now, stress levels are through the roof
[SPEAKER_02]: with people, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so super key indicators,
you know, that I think really impact
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid function are things like,
you know, that, that stress hormone
[SPEAKER_02]: cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine,
you know, dopamine type parts of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that leads me down sort of taking a
good, hard look at, at where these stress
[SPEAKER_02]: hormones comes in and questionnaires are
usually, you know, the most
[SPEAKER_02]: straightforward way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when I start taking a look at
adrenal stress, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and sort of these elevated cortisol,
you know, adrenaline, noradrenaline
[SPEAKER_02]: pathways, you know, sleep's always a big
indicator.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I really, I try and get patients
to tell me, okay, a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's your sleep looking like,
you know, and if people are coming in,
[SPEAKER_02]: because again, there's different ways that
people don't sleep well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly I think, you know,
if I take a look at where a vast majority
[SPEAKER_02]: of my patients are using, you know,
cannabinoid therapies, it's certainly in
[SPEAKER_02]: the area of sleep, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but I think that's for some patients
that works and for some patients that
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that goes into sort of that
regulatory effect of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you, are you sort of winding someone
down by having more GABA in their system,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, or, you know, are they starting
to be stressed out and is this cortisol?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where there's that interplay
between the stress response and these
[SPEAKER_02]: neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's this question, you know,
so sleep, so I asked patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, if I'm trying to root out,
okay, is there a stress response?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is usually something like
cortisol is a big one, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a good indicator about,
okay, first of all, are you having
[SPEAKER_02]: difficulty falling asleep at night?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a patient, for example, that,
you know, they need to get to bed by a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain timeframe.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not in bed and asleep between
nine and 10, you know, suddenly they get a
[SPEAKER_02]: second win and they're up and about again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's almost always a pretty
good indicator that they're getting a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of a second cortisol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spike, which is unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your cortisol should be sort of winding
down towards the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it peaks in the morning and then
it tapers off throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if it starts to come up a little
bit at the end of the day, you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: see this, the sleep issue, you know,
and so that becomes something that will,
[SPEAKER_02]: will probably impact your response to
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you may find that the cannabinoids
knock you out and certainly depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the, the form that you're using,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, and I'm sure you've had
this conversation many times, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: orally, you know, cannabinoids take longer
to set in, but you get that six to eight
[SPEAKER_02]: window effect and you get a little bit
more of those psychoactive compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: because of that sort of first pass liver
function there a little bit as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, but if some people are
vaping or something like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they may not are using,
you know, different forms of it that have
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit more rapid onset that might
clear out a little bit more quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a patient that's a vaping,
I usually recommend vaping as opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking just because of my environmental
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Background and smoking is not something
that I try to, I try to discourage as much
[SPEAKER_02]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, an hour and a half,
two hours and suddenly they'll be up
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really need to take a look at that
cortisol response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, there's different ways you can
deal with that, you know, whether that's
[SPEAKER_02]: meditation, winding down, taking a look at
your use of electronics beforehand,
[SPEAKER_02]: what does your stress sleep, hydrate gene
look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's some herbs that I use
that are quite helpful in there that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of synergize nicely with cannabinoids
there as well too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really interesting point about
the lights in the evenings and that second
[SPEAKER_00]: potential cortisol spike because,
you know, clearly I talk with patients
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, sleeping and cannabis all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number one thing that comes up
with people is I ask them, do you drink
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people are like, oh, I've got such
insomnia, but like, I know that coffee has
[SPEAKER_00]: got a half life of 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means that by the time they're
drinking their coffee tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_00]: they still have this morning's coffee
still in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I encourage them to, you know,
cut down on or get rid of the coffee or
[SPEAKER_00]: caffeine and, you know, their,
their insomnia will probably go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, after they look at me with
utter shock, you know, they're all like,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen, I'd rather keep the caffeine and
just use more THC to sleep, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's not uncommon,
but this idea of the blue lights and using
[SPEAKER_00]: electronics at night of which I am
absolutely guilty of, it's an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that if poor sleep is decreasing our
cannabinoid uptake and effectiveness and
[SPEAKER_00]: poor sleep comes from using my phone in
bed at night and getting a second wind and
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out for two hours on bed,
reading stuff, what does, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we backtrack that all the way back,
my using my devices at night is hurting my
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not something I think is
immediately apparent to most folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly wasn't to me until now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, you know, again,
if we, you think about it in the context
[SPEAKER_02]: of, of a thermostat, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, you know, my thermostat
goes and tries to heat the house,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I've got the windows and doors open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's going to be a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's only, there's only so
much capacity that you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, you know, I mean,
and this touches on, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the genetics that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It talks about sort of the nutritional
capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It talks about the hormonal environment,
you know, so, you know, all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, you know, it's sort of like,
okay, how do I optimize the system?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and this is the interesting
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is I think, I think that the thing that's
become most apparent to me here is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that your, your body, it seems to me,
and there's probably people that are much
[SPEAKER_02]: smarter than me that could expect,
you know, that could explain this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe poke holes in this argument.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please feel free to, I'd love to learn
about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but what I find is, is for example,
like, let's take a look at the stress
[SPEAKER_02]: response and talk about inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I want to use this example to
demonstrate is it isn't turn one on,
[SPEAKER_02]: turn one off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's turn both on and then turn one off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what ends up happening is you get a
faster response if you have the sort of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the driver and the inhibitor
going at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a tension created in the
system, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens is, is that, so for
example, when we take a look at cortisol
[SPEAKER_02]: response, cortisol is a immunosuppressant,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it, it, it's an anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that's taken prednisone or high,
you know, will, will appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very powerful anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, cortotrophic releasing
hormone, which is the hormone that
[SPEAKER_02]: stimulates the response of that also has
an impact on vagal nerve tone,
[SPEAKER_02]: which drives a pro-inflammatory response.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got the same mechanism,
like different branches of the cortisol
[SPEAKER_02]: result being anti-inflammatory,
but then pro-inflammatory at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about it, it's like,
okay, well, I'm going to run away from,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use a distinctly Canadian response,
you know, the, the grizzly bear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to wait for your system to
come online.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they've given you a club or two and
you're running away like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want your system to come online.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically as your stress response
drops, suddenly it unleashes the
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-inflammatory effect, you know,
on your nervous system, which is wired to
[SPEAKER_02]: get you the hell out of dodge,
you know, suddenly shuts down and calms
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the other one can basically cascade in
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the endocannabinoid system
probably has that same type of tension in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got all these other
modifiers around it as well, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we talk about the lack of sleep
or the dietary issues on top of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: suddenly you're, you're taking away,
you're limiting the resiliency of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of sort of cornering it in a
little bit so that you limit that response
[SPEAKER_02]: a bit that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so so far we have talked about the
analytics that are helpful that come from
[SPEAKER_00]: blood tests and hormone tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've alluded a couple of times to
genetic screens and especially the 23 and
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you already mentioned this,
but we're going to set aside the concerns
[SPEAKER_00]: that many people have about whether or not
there are identifying aspects of their
[SPEAKER_00]: health that are going into these large
data sets and, and, and whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: people want to participate, we're just
going to set that aside for this
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause again, that's a whole nother show.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're going to focus on though is the
usefulness of this kind of a test for the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so what, what do these, this,
these variety of tests show us that is
[SPEAKER_00]: worth noting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, you know, you can break this out
into the endocannabinoid genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then the nutritional stuff,
you know, and, and sort of hormone
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolism, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so where I start to take a look
at here is, you know, some of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: you can start to see is, you know,
the cannabinoid receptor and, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, dopamine receptors and such,
you know, you see, you see some genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: variants where, you know, these receptors
are, are more responsive or less
[SPEAKER_02]: responsive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that starts to set up, you know,
are some patients, you're more likely to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, become a little bit more
hooked on, you know, habitual cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: use, you know, they get the reward seeking
response from that a little bit and they
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to go down that pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly that's something to be aware
of, you know, when you're taking a look
[SPEAKER_02]: and what you're going to provide from a
formulation standpoint, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so there's, there's that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we can also start to dig
into, you know, some of these that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, drive the different aspects of
the cannabinoid system, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can take a look at, you know,
a FAA, you know, fatty acid, amide,
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrolase, you know, MAGL, another one as
well to degrade that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, those enzymes kind of give
a sense of how quickly, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: these endocannabinoids hang around inside
your, your, your synapse, the gap between
[SPEAKER_02]: your nerves on that as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it just gives you a sense of
what's the, the resiliency of that system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can start to build out some sense
of, of that, you know, certainly where I
[SPEAKER_02]: start to take a look at it as things like,
you know, because most patients come in
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I think your, your comment a
bit earlier on about how we tend to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: patient population that have exhausted
other options.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tend to have a little bit more of the
canaries and the coal mines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly I tend to see some of the,
the stuff that I also saw in my multiply
[SPEAKER_02]: chemically sensitive patients,
which is that, you know, which a very
[SPEAKER_02]: similar population in some respects is
that they have genetic variants and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like their ability to clear out these
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, if we are these compounds,
like, let's talk about your caffeine
[SPEAKER_02]: example that you use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people genetically don't clear out
caffeine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some do just fine, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, these are, you know,
and again, I suspect that the people that
[SPEAKER_02]: are a little bit more sensitive to
caffeine, you know, are again,
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of these people that have some of
these genetic variants about clearance of
[SPEAKER_02]: cytochrome enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that, and that may impact clearance
of other medications and other substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, again, a whole other
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about Google's, you know,
I think it's called Alpha One is their new
[SPEAKER_02]: artificial intelligence that looks at
protein folding on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it came up with some really
interesting stuff, which is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, sort of genes appear to organize
in biochemical pathways, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that, you know, they kind of support
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, for example, I did 23andMe,
and it turns out that I'm genetically
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-programmed to have to have cod liver
oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Swedish and Swiss background pretty
much means that I don't do vitamin D
[SPEAKER_02]: terribly well.
[SPEAKER_02]: My vitamin A, I don't convert it from
plants terribly well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my oils, the plant-based oils,
I can't really convert them into the sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of the omega-3 stuff that we find in fish
oils, you know, but that group of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that repeatedly in patient
populations that, you know, people of
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern European descent and things like
that, and some of the First Nations
[SPEAKER_02]: populations, you know, seem to have these
things where their vitamin D and their
[SPEAKER_02]: essential fatty acids and fat-soluble
vitamins seem to be tied together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we see this in other
different elements as well, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's a really cool element of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we go down the pathway of things
like, again, depending on what our
[SPEAKER_02]: patients are looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, anxiety, stress,
mood, depression, you know, chronic pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: I really start taking a look at a lot of
the tryptophan stuff around this as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some really interesting aspects
because that ties in both with the B
[SPEAKER_02]: vitamins that we talked a little bit
earlier about folic acid, B12,
[SPEAKER_02]: and B6 support, and then also the ability
to convert, you know, the amino acid
[SPEAKER_02]: tryptophan into 5-hydroxy tryptophan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, there's some genetic variation on
that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, these are the types of things that,
you know, as you start to take a look,
[SPEAKER_02]: they show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And different platforms have different
elements of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just use the 23andMe raw data and load
that into a multiple of different,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, genomic platforms to start to
identify those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's several of them
that I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on one right now with another
company to try and make a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: specific sort of functional cannabinoid
medicine platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, hopefully, we'll have that out in
the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So... That's going to be popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it'd be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the challenge is trying to
simplify this stuff down because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, again, it's... I realize I'm
probably just, you know, people are kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of getting a fire hose effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm giving little snippets of it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully, we can make it much more
practical and patient-friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that idea of being overwhelmed by the
details, like, that's not lost on me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are kind of moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of vocabulary in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also true to life, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, this is what it's like to be
a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, anybody who is still with us on the
episode, you know...
[SPEAKER_00]: People have got to decide that they're
going to care enough to learn the
[SPEAKER_00]: vocabulary if they are going to become
captains of their own health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot have optimum health,
let alone individualized cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, in a Western healthcare system
that is designed more to keep us on
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals than it is to heal us and
move us on our way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, while at certain times
the vocabulary that you've used even,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, washed me in new ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, I've got a long list of things
that I'm going to Google when we're done
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what it's like to be a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I think that cannabis patients,
probably more than most, are used to this
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've already talked about how
cannabis patients are generally outliers
[SPEAKER_00]: because the rest of the medical system has
given up on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they've... So, they've had to
take their research into their own hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, those are probably the people that
this episode is most targeted for because
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're giving... I mean, like,
you know, from helping enough of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends...
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I've got rheumatoid arthritis
friends and hypothyroid friends and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are little snippets throughout the
episode where people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: ooh, there's a new search term for me that
I had not considered on whatever topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's how self-empowered
patients have to go about their medical
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, anyway, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's part of the course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say again, you know,
I mean, this is interesting because again,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when I take a look, I mean,
I've been a naturopathic doctor now for...
[SPEAKER_02]: Graduated in 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I had, you know,
undergraduate and naturopathic college.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as well with that for five years,
you know, five years of naturopathic
[SPEAKER_02]: college, four years of undergraduate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I've kind of been steeped in
this for a really long time in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: this integrative alternative medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're talking about in cannabis
medicine isn't new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is something that sort of the
holistic integrative medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, when I started off in
this area, I mean, I remember going down
[SPEAKER_02]: and I grew up in Victoria on Vancouver
Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember going down to the Chinatown
and getting Chinese herbal medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And walking into this and it was like,
it was just, you know, the smells and
[SPEAKER_02]: this, you know, you're just like,
oh my God, this is just so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but, you know, there's little
Chinese fellow, you know, giving me all
[SPEAKER_02]: these herbs, these wonderful herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just, you know, and now we take
a look and go into any sort of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, choices, you know, integrative
pharmacy, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see what the evolutions look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis has the potential and it just
follows following that same course,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just at a very magnified effect,
simply because the population behind that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's driving it is, I think it was just
pent up demand and suddenly it released.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now it's moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, what you're talking about with
cannabis patients is exactly what I find
[SPEAKER_02]: in my patient population as non-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all very engaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have these conversations with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I never underestimate the capacity
of my patients, you know, to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: the concepts that I'm giving them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not getting it, it's because
I'm not doing a good enough job explaining
[SPEAKER_02]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I need to come back around
and find out that language that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I know that we've slipped into some
jargon around that, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, certainly, you know, we can sort of
dial that back in a lot of different ways,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's patients being empowered.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's patients starting to look into this
saying, look, you know, I don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: the current model is not serving us well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The symptom oriented thing, we're just
dealing with a symptom is kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: equivalent of, you know, pulling the
batteries out of my smoke alarm while
[SPEAKER_02]: there's toast burning in my toaster,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it gets rid of the irritation on
it, but there's still this underlying
[SPEAKER_02]: issue that's kind of happening there a
little bit that needs to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what patients are just
struggling to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, again, I don't, there's just a
medical system that they're trained to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, okay, well, I need to,
you know, I always joke with my patients a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, your doctor is concerned with
you not dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really care about how you feel
about it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't mean that to be overly
critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means like, look, they've got more
pressing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make sure you're not dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that you've got a little bit of
body aches and pains because you're taking
[SPEAKER_02]: your stat and they're like, well,
this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you're not going to die of a
heart attack, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the intention behind that is caring and
genuine and all the rest of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that, you know, what are they
going to do about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's the tool that they're going to
have?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the option for them is to put them
on the medication, switch it around a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit or stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but again, all of us,
I mean, even in this conversation,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a deluge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this has been 20 years of
experience that I've got locked up into my
[SPEAKER_02]: brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it would be unfair to expect
someone else to try and have that same
[SPEAKER_02]: type of experience and be able to bring
that to bear, you know, and so you do what
[SPEAKER_02]: you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like, I don't know, I mean,
you can, there's a billion different
[SPEAKER_02]: topics you could bring up that I'm like,
I don't know a whole hell of a lot about
[SPEAKER_02]: that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to need to do some work on that
and talk to some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think at the end of the day,
you build a healthy, healthy healthcare
[SPEAKER_02]: team of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You become your best advocate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you do your homework on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you'd be inquisitive and curious and
you know, you persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on Vashon where, where I live,
Vashon Island, about, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: gosh, has it been six years now?
[SPEAKER_00]: We formed a patient and cannabis
enthusiast community social group here
[SPEAKER_00]: called Vimea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we, we continue to use this
term scrappy street medicine because so
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the people who have come to
endocannabinopathic medicine because they
[SPEAKER_00]: were fringe and black swans and outside of
the medicine by average, they have had to
[SPEAKER_00]: self teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly before Google, it was,
you know, nearly impossible to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of research, but it's becoming easier
and easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all have kind of embraced this idea
that we work together to bring our
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-existing scrappy street medicine out
of the bro science and into an
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding that you're talking about of
integrative medicine that's been around
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while, but also has had the
difficulty of not being incredibly popular
[SPEAKER_00]: or accessible to most people and,
and is not taught in regular school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, even though to you,
you know, you've been studying this for
[SPEAKER_00]: over 20 years for most of us, you know,
just simple stuff like including
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental medicine, what, what in your
house is off gassing something can be mind
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing because a lot of people are taught
that, you know, all the, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial manufacturing is fine,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so that's, that's how I,
you know, that's how a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of folks come up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As, as, you know, scrappy street medicine
folks who then get access to professionals
[SPEAKER_00]: like you, who are now more accessible to
us in cannabis because you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not shamed and it's not as taboo to
come on and on a podcast like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we get to hear some, you know,
hints and best practices from somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's, who's inside the specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before, before we wrap up and go to our
next commercial break, Chris, were there
[SPEAKER_00]: any other tests that you wanted to make
sure that you pointed out for caregivers
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or patients that they'll want to take
a look at for clues?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, you've mentioned the blood tests,
hormone tests and the genetic screens so
[SPEAKER_00]: far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think probably the last ones would be
that what kind of touched on was the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the fats part of it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, there's, there's some
questionnaires that I use, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like, you know, do you have dry
skin, you know, uh, you know, what's with
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammation, you know, there's some
different conditions that you can use to
[SPEAKER_02]: get a sense of, um, you know, with,
with the fatty acid statuses, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: and for the most part, if you've got dry
scaly skin, that's always dry,
[SPEAKER_02]: you probably are pretty much deficient in
fats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you might take a look at
things like vitamin D status.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an easy test to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it has significant impacts,
especially for, for those of us,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, up near the border and above the
border here, you know, above the wall,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, uh, so, so those are
important things that I think are,
[SPEAKER_02]: are elements of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's one last blood work test
that I, that I like is one called GGT.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a liver enzyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually used to test for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most doctors will look at if it's elevated
and say, you need to stop drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, but what it is actually is it's a
really, uh, it's a decent marker for
[SPEAKER_02]: something called glutathione, which is a
super important antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, it's built out of an amino acid
called N acetylcysteine that actually is
[SPEAKER_02]: showing some real promise and things like
helping with addiction and, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, neurotransmitters, certain
neuroplasticity, brain health,
[SPEAKER_02]: Parkinson's, you know, antioxidant status,
you know, this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's, that's one that I tend
to check a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, um, and I take a look at
those numbers and it's one of those ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that even though the upper level of it is,
is fairly high, there's been some
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting papers published that showed
it's actually based on, uh, insurance
[SPEAKER_02]: actuarial tables that show that,
you know, sub optimal levels occur at much
[SPEAKER_02]: lower levels within the normal range of
that as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a big one that I like to take a
look at as well too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go ahead and take that
second short break and be right back after
[SPEAKER_00]: the break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we are going to go into, uh,
talking about a whole foods, your diet and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you can support your endocannabinoid
system through your food choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is naturopathic
physician, Chris Spooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U S at 900
[SPEAKER_00]: propagules per gram of two fungal species
selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volcani
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but also as a bio-stimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side by sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_00]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's d-y-n-o-m-y-c-o.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire listeners can get 10% off any
size of Dynomyco on Amazon or dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_00]: by using the discount code shaping fire,
one word, no caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots, or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_00]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the National Hemp Program influx due
to stringent THC testing requirements,
[SPEAKER_00]: brothers Seth and Eric Crawford continue
to release seeds to hemp farmers that will
[SPEAKER_00]: be legal, no matter how you grow them or
when you test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These new varieties from Oregon CBD seeds
have substantial amounts of CBDV,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGV, CBCV, and THCV while always staying
below the 0.3% THC limit and guaranteeing
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant crops for farmers every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, these new varieties cannot be
pollinated by your neighbor's uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen or a rogue male in your own crop
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD seeds are non-GMO certified
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD seeds was founded and funded in
2015 by Seth and Eric maxing out their
[SPEAKER_00]: personal credit cards without outside
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continue to refuse outside investment
that would change their company culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD grows tons of fresh food on
their research farms for local food banks,
[SPEAKER_00]: literally tons of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also give away tens of thousands of
pounds of R&D flour to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: As their company began to succeed,
Seth and Eric started donating money to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause
too by giving millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon State University in order to
establish the world's leading cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics research program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they treat their employees right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD pays for full health and dental
coverage for their employees, a 401k
[SPEAKER_00]: program and their minimum starting wage is
20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus everyone shares food from the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth has been on shaping fire a few times
to talk about novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check out episodes 25 and 37 on
CBD cultivars in the hemp market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 66 on triploid cannabis genetics
and the very first shaping fire live
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 47 with Seth and soil expert,
Jeff Lowenfels talking about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a hemp farmer and you want to
grow reliable seeds that are sure to
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive in past testing, check out
oregoncbdseeds.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: buying seeds for the 2021 season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's oregoncbdseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to home growers, patients and
commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb and Specta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his lineage and the hard earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long time heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb, also known as Specta and Pirates of
the Emerald Triangle, is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_00]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year here on Vashon Island and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines, along with
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shane Golos, and our guest
this week is naturopathic physician,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Spooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first two sets, we talked
primarily about figuring out what might be
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem and how best and what kinds of
cannabinoids that we want to introduce
[SPEAKER_00]: into your body for optimum benefit from
your cannabinopathic care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we have sussed out that it can get
really complex fast, and the context for
[SPEAKER_00]: every single patient is slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so today's episode has so far has not
been the same solutions for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially, here are a bunch of
things to consider, and then now you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go on your own individualized path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, set three is gonna be a little
different because we're gonna be talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the foods that you can eat that
generally strengthen your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is especially great, especially
for folks who either went around and owned
[SPEAKER_00]: out their cannabis use with food that's
gonna support their endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system, or folks who just can't really
afford all the cannabinoids that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need, but they do have access to clean
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked in the past with Dr. Russo
on an earlier episode about his seminal
[SPEAKER_00]: paper about particular foods that
strengthen the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that has not been updated in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chris, I know that you work with
patients all the time, both as a
[SPEAKER_00]: naturopath, but also in your specificity
of the gut, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're talking about foods,
about the foods that they're eating all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we start with the
recommendations that you give your patient
[SPEAKER_00]: base on foods that they should eat for
endocannabinoid health?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, it's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we've touched on a lot of
these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think you probably get,
wouldn't be too surprising giving our
[SPEAKER_02]: previous conversation, but I try,
you know, patients sometimes prefer
[SPEAKER_02]: supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to try and get patients to do as
much as food wise as they can to start off
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so, I mean, I'd probably say for
those of you that have been listening,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the first one I'd be going with
is something like cod liver oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most people it's, it's,
they're looking at it going like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, that just sounds downright
disgusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things I really like about
it is that it's got a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got vitamin A and vitamin D in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so the, for those people
that genetically aren't able to do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it kind of bypasses, you know,
that issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got, cod liver oil
actually has a fair amount of what's
[SPEAKER_02]: called DHA in it, which is one of these
essential fatty acids that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful for brain health and its partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the EPA is, is a bit of an
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I find that, you know, for those
patients that are coming in with
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammatory illnesses or neurological
stuff or, you know, inflammatory
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions like fibromyalgia and this type
of thing, I mean, this is a good place to
[SPEAKER_02]: start, you know, arthritis pain,
you know, this type of thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so, you know, tablespoon of cod liver oil
gets you your A's and your D's,
[SPEAKER_02]: your fat soluble vitamins and those
important essential fatty acids,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and it's, again, we could
certainly dig down deeper into the science
[SPEAKER_02]: behind why that is and whatever,
but, you know, I mean, we do see that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Omega-3 deficiencies definitely
really impact the sort of endocannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, particularly the neuronal
functions as well too, but also synergizes
[SPEAKER_02]: quite nicely through the anti-inflammatory
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it synergizes really nicely with things
like CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be probably one of the first
ones I'd be taking a look at there as well
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one that I'm super fascinated by
is this whole concept of the microbiome,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so what I think that you
start taking a look at here is this whole,
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget what the paper was here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to pull it up here real
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, yeah, endocannabinoid is the
crossroad between the gut microbiota and
[SPEAKER_02]: host metabolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually published in Nature,
I think in 2016, a super fascinating
[SPEAKER_02]: article about this that talks about the
role of the microbiome and actually how it
[SPEAKER_02]: impacts a lot of liver pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I suspect this isn't
something that shows up on everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: radar, but, is it in epidemic proportions
here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we always attributed that with alcohol
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it turns out it actually has a
pretty significant component of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, disruptions in the gut
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seems to be impacted by
endocannabinoids, interestingly enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, taking a look at what's happening
within that, that, you know, gut bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: within the digestive tract, I think is
hugely important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, again, I could go on and on
about it, about the trials and
[SPEAKER_02]: tribulations and the disrespect shown to
our hepatic liver system, but I won't,
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't stand up for them on that soapbox
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I certainly think, you know,
anything that supports the bacteria in
[SPEAKER_02]: your gut, and that would be something
like, you know, a probiotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go down, you know,
the foods that you would be looking at,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd be taking a look at fermented foods,
you know, your sauerkrauts, your yogurts,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, these types of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that really, they do two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, they supply bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's, there's a lot of
subtleties in the quality of probiotics
[SPEAKER_02]: and that, that certainly again,
we could go on long enough, but suffice it
[SPEAKER_02]: to say a lot of the fiber and a lot of
the, like the, the fermented byproducts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, in yogurt and milk
products, the sugar lactose is composed of
[SPEAKER_02]: galactose and glucose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can get what's called the
galacto-alegose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get saccharide, which turns
out to be very helpful for the gut
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's produced in yogurt,
you know, along with sort of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fermentation products and the sort of pH
altering effects of that, the lactic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the fermented foods,
you know, if you're dairy sensitive or
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that, you could take a look at
other different fermented foods in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's a super important
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a lot of people who are sensitive
to dairy foods like I am actually are okay
[SPEAKER_00]: with the fermented ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, you won't see me
drinking a glass of milk, but I can
[SPEAKER_00]: totally handle quality yogurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you get like a grass-fed
yogurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it actually dovetails with the types
of fats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grass-fed animals have different omega-3,
you know, fatty acid profiles in their
[SPEAKER_02]: milk that are skewed to the more
beneficial ones too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a double whammy with stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could certainly tolerate a
grass-fed yogurt, great, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, goat's yogurt is probably
another one that you could look at if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're, if you're not too averse to goaty
flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, go from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so that would be something that I
think are definitely things you can
[SPEAKER_02]: involve in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiber is super important, you know,
especially for large bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, again, I'm not going to go too
far down this rabbit hole, but let's just
[SPEAKER_02]: suffice it to say that your gut bacteria
is not the same below the stomach as it is
[SPEAKER_02]: in the large intestine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It varies significantly in the types of
bacteria, you know, what they do and what
[SPEAKER_02]: they produce and what they eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones that we really want to
emphasize going back to that conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: about butyrate, that's, you know,
again, adding things like oat bran and
[SPEAKER_02]: psyllium husks and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two big ones that I
recommend on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anything that's, you know,
you could add, you know, the healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: fibers into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, some people have sensitivities
around gluten and this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, this is where, you know,
I get a gluten-free oat or something along
[SPEAKER_02]: those lines might be something to consider
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, rice brands can be part of that
that start to bypass that as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But getting in those, those fibers that
the bacteria can start to work on and
[SPEAKER_02]: produce some of these really important
compounds, I think is really, really
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you know, we could spend hours
talking about that, but I think if I were
[SPEAKER_02]: to make those three recommendations to
patients, that would be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a dietary strategy overall,
I tend to encourage patients to move more
[SPEAKER_02]: towards that paleo, keto type end of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is recognizing that not all
diets, there's a lot of caveats that go in
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly I'm not out of the view of,
you know, paleo means eat red meat and
[SPEAKER_02]: bacon and cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means, you know, Mediterranean type
diets, you know, olive oils, healthy oils,
[SPEAKER_02]: fish, avocado, you know, coconut oils,
you know, organic safflower, sunflower
[SPEAKER_02]: oils, flax oils, those types of things,
healthy nuts and seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and again, I think most people
would be like, yeah, it sounds like a
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should probably do some more of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're really trying to improve your
endocannabinoid tone, that's where I'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: leading.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I said most of my
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so like, let's look at the
opposite, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned earlier the idea of,
you know, having the heating on in your
[SPEAKER_00]: house, but then having the window open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you might be heating your house,
but all the good it's doing is just going
[SPEAKER_00]: right out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that so often when I go to
conventions and, you know, people are all
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, you know, cannabis medicine
and patients, and then we break for lunch
[SPEAKER_00]: and I watch these people eating like the
crackiest, you know, fast food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, you know, essentially
they're leaving their window open,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They know about health, but then they're
actually putting, you know, tinder into
[SPEAKER_00]: their body instead of like nice long
burning logs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you speak a little bit to the harm
that processed foods do to the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah, we want to increase the
quality of the foods we are eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we really should be
getting rid of these other foods that are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually causing damage to the
endocannabinoid system at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, and again, most people
when they see a naturopathic physician,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're pretty much being, well,
he's going to take me off sugar,
[SPEAKER_02]: dairy, and wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might as well fit the stereotype and
don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, definitely, I think when you take
a look at particularly your processed
[SPEAKER_02]: foods, you know, I mean, there's a number
of different things that come into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe there's a couple of reasons
that might surprise people.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody wants an interesting read on
it, there's a book, Sugar, Salt,
[SPEAKER_02]: Fat, that talks about, you know,
sort of the fast food industry and the
[SPEAKER_02]: processed food industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it was essentially an
investigative journalist that had heard
[SPEAKER_02]: that a lot of the foods, you know,
big companies, General Mills, Nabisco,
[SPEAKER_02]: and RSA got together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them was kind of saying,
like one of the individuals was being
[SPEAKER_02]: like, look, we may be kind of moving into
cigarette territory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or suddenly, it's going to become apparent
that there were some real health benefits
[SPEAKER_02]: that we kind of knew about that we kind of
pushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a fascinating read.
[SPEAKER_02]: But aside from the fact that something
like, you know, your hydrogenated fats and
[SPEAKER_02]: your trans fats, the problem is,
is that these fats are odd lengths.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you're taking a look at
essential fatty acids, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 16, 18, 20, 22 carbon molecules strung
together with different bends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the Omega 3, for example,
talks about you have a bend in the fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think of it as a pipe cleaner,
there's a bend at, you know, the third
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon in, you know, whereas an Omega 6,
it's the sixth carbon in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these hydrogenated fats have these
bends and these lengths that are just odd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your system doesn't quite know what to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of liken it to gumming up the
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're putting these fats into
your body, suddenly you're getting this
[SPEAKER_02]: odd kind of, you know, your body's like,
what do I do with this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do I make with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we, you know, extend this to
the thing of like, hey, Omega 3
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies have impacts on your
endocannabinoid tone because some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: important endocannabinoids are associated
with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you start throwing more of these
fats and they start to predominate in your
[SPEAKER_02]: system, then that starts to become
problematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sugars and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not so much, I mean, you know,
heaven forbid, I, you know, I can be a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of a chocoholic myself at times as well
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I think there's an important
balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I kind of use the 80,
20 rule, you know, 80% of the time I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: good, 20% of the time I enjoy stuff,
you know, and, you know, like a nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, something tasty every once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try not to be too obsessive about it,
but you know, as your health challenges
[SPEAKER_02]: mount up, that becomes less and less over
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think arguably, you know,
some of the larger issues that we see in
[SPEAKER_02]: the context of health, you know,
inflammation, insulin, blood glucose
[SPEAKER_02]: issues are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So carbohydrates start to become super
important and really trying to making sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're getting our, our carbohydrates
to have a lot of fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the analogy that you use, like a quick
burning piece of newspaper in your
[SPEAKER_02]: fireplace, burning a log, you know,
there's a difference between a steel cut
[SPEAKER_02]: oat versus oat flour, which I equate to
similar type of burn times, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think trying to get your carbs as
unrefined, as unprocessed, as whole as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible is where I would be suggesting
that way as well too, to help limit those
[SPEAKER_02]: blood sugar swings and those insulin
response and thereby, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably being at the base of the pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your 80, 20, you know,
it fits for so many things, but in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case, I think that most folks are probably
80% eating questionable food and 20%
[SPEAKER_00]: eating healthy food, but really
remembering the 20% that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, most folks seem to be
kind of out of touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing the power of a food journal
to really get to the bottom of what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single time in my life that I have
done a food journal, I have been shocked
[SPEAKER_00]: and disappointed in myself for what I'm
actually eating in real life versus what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I'm eating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something I do with patients
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give a minimum of a two week diet diary
with all of my patients and it's not so
[SPEAKER_02]: much, you know, and I can do all sorts of
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like interventional pain management.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can stick needles in people's backs and
joints and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll be like, yeah, and ask them to
stop, you know, do a diet diary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd think I was, you know, trying to
remove one of their limbs or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's, it's, it's challenging,
but I tell them, it's like, look,
[SPEAKER_02]: this isn't really for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most patients usually after about a week
or so start getting the general digest and
[SPEAKER_02]: they start modifying their diet all by
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really a sneaky little trick I do is I
just keep on giving them all by
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dropped out there right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the very last thing you said?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I just give them diet diaries for
three, four weeks and they just start
[SPEAKER_02]: making changes all by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't even need to tell them
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, they know what they need to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes so apparent themselves.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So corollary to the sugar, of course,
is alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how will using alcohol, like processed
food, degrade our endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think again, alcohol, there's a
context to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it depends on the type of alcohol
and how much you're drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've got the French paradox
where, you know, a glass of red wine and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that's not really too much of
an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, you know, there may be some
health benefits because it helps you relax
[SPEAKER_02]: and unwind and, and things like that as
well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some people, again, genetically,
have problems metabolizing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly we know, I mean,
my general experience, and this comes from
[SPEAKER_02]: my environmental medicine stuff,
is that things like alcoholism and that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's, there was some really interesting
stuff that we saw around serotonin,
[SPEAKER_02]: tryptophan metabolism and that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, there's that intersection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't, I don't know exactly where it
all in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, but I do tell patients like,
look, you know, let's take a look at your
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol consumption, because again,
you could potentially you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: limiting your resiliency, resilient,
you know, because you're starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: consume bandwidth in your endocannabinoid
tone through these, these disruptions in
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these also little metabolites
that your body has to, to clear out as
[SPEAKER_02]: well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the next issue that starts to
become problematic in that is that I find
[SPEAKER_02]: that a lot of stuff, a lot of patients
have going to the gut microbiome,
[SPEAKER_02]: like yeast issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not uncommon to see patients have
sort of sensitivity to yeasts in,
[SPEAKER_02]: because of, you know, like, you know,
particularly no disrespect to the craft
[SPEAKER_02]: beer industry, but they tend to have a
little bit more yeasty type stuff in there
[SPEAKER_02]: as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see sometimes that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I tend to watch, tell patients,
you know, with a lot of GI issues to watch
[SPEAKER_02]: out for, for stuff with high yeast
contents and whether that's craft beers or
[SPEAKER_02]: homemade wines or things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's another option as well
to get them to consider.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's do a little summary here
before we wrap up there, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as we've already recognized,
we were a little, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were kind of like shooting like shotgun
pellets, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a little bit scattered,
but, but we covered a wide breadth of area
[SPEAKER_00]: so that hopefully we were able to provide
new search terms and new, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: paradigms, new ideas, new approaches
mentally for both caregivers who are
[SPEAKER_00]: intaking a new patient and want to help
them with their endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as self-directed, you know,
cannabis enthusiasts who are trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there's kind of
something for everybody in this show,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to, to kind of summarize it,
what are your, I'm going to ask you for
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations for two different kinds of
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would, what is, would be kind of your
summary recommendation for someone coming
[SPEAKER_00]: to use cannabis medicine or food for
health for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what are the rec, your
recommendations for long-term cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: users who already, you know, are using
cannabinoids, but they want to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: effective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a clinician, the thing that I,
as you probably got, I like lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: information, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the, the more we understand
about, you know, what we're using and what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're dealing with, that helps inform our
decision-making process and helps us make
[SPEAKER_02]: better decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, for someone who's new to
cannabis, you know, who's you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: where would I start?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, again, obviously, you know,
we're taking a look at what's your overall
[SPEAKER_02]: health, you know, what is it that we're
dealing with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you looking at inflammatory
conditions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you looking at gut engines?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so get, get your medical records,
get, you know, review what's going on here
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit, try and get a sense of,
okay, you know, what's my overall health
[SPEAKER_02]: looking like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then dietary wise, you know,
spend some time and just do the basic
[SPEAKER_02]: nutritional stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, take a look at that,
you know, clean up the diet, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: get some exercise going, optimize your
potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are, these are really basic things,
you know, and there's lots of different
[SPEAKER_02]: tools that are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's apps and fitness bits and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I certainly encourage patients to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes down to the cannabis itself,
which we haven't really touched on yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think this is, this answer kind of
goes into where I suggest both my more
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced cannabis patients,
which I would give the same
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations to as the new patients,
but with my cannabis standpoint is know
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think the biggest issue that I see
here patients, we don't know what's in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know the ratios of your CBD,
your THC, the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know how it's being extracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's there with it as well too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, know what's going into your
bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I were to summarize everything that
we're talking about, whether it's diet or
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's cannabis, it's like know what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your information, understand what it
is that you're eating, what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the food, what's in your food,
understand what's in your cannabis and get
[SPEAKER_02]: that and be thorough about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be your own advocate and,
you know, knowledge is power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Chris, thank you so much for
spending your time and your expertise with
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when Dr. Russo recommended you
to me after, after I initiated a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with individualized cannabis
medicine, he's all, you know, you really
[SPEAKER_00]: need to check out my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chris up in Canada and, and,
you know, I saw who you were on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet, but then when we started
talking, I'm like, holy hell, this guy has
[SPEAKER_00]: got really unique information that I
haven't seen elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been my experience today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate both your expertise
and, and your good cheer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's been a real pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've really enjoyed this.
