[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being here, everyone,
and welcome to the 1110 Living Soils
[SPEAKER_04]: panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: The length of the panel is going to be
starting now and running about 50 minutes
[SPEAKER_04]: until noon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do about 40, 45 minutes of
conversation, and then all three of our
[SPEAKER_04]: guest speakers, we're very excited to take
your questions, so then we'll switch over
[SPEAKER_04]: and do 10 or 15 minutes of questions from
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you who are new to probiotic
and living soil and you're here as a
[SPEAKER_04]: beginner, building living soil with active
micro-life is the progression of growing
[SPEAKER_04]: versus what we're used to experience
during the early provision indoor days
[SPEAKER_04]: where soil might as well have been
styrofoam and then you'd do a super packet
[SPEAKER_04]: with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: This new idea we're going to talk about
today considers the soil as a living
[SPEAKER_04]: participant in the grow and our goal is to
foster microorganism communities within
[SPEAKER_04]: your soil to have a plant, so that makes
us as much soil farmers as campus farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first let's welcome our guests.
[SPEAKER_04]: From this side, let's start with,
this is Anne McClay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anne is a biologist, gardener,
and co-author of several probiotic and
[SPEAKER_04]: regenerative agriculture books including
The Hidden Half of Nature, The Microbial
Roots of Life and Health, and also right
after this presentation she will be at the
Microbes booth doing a book signing if
you'd like to meet her and get a copy of
your book signing.
To her left is Colin Bell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colin is the co-founder and co-inventor
and chief growth officer at ProCentia,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you're probably more familiar with
them as Modern Microbes and their fabulous
[SPEAKER_04]: product Mammoth Pea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colin received his PhD in biological
sciences specializing in soil microbial
[SPEAKER_04]: ecology and plant microinteraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to his left, Tad Hussey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tad is a living soil educator and host of
the Canvas Cultivation and Science
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's also owner of Keep It Simple Organics
in Edible Nursery, Production Greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_04]: Outdoor Preschool, and Organic Hydroponics
Shop, an online store nearby here in
[SPEAKER_04]: Redmond, Washington, and also at
KISOrganics.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am Shango Lowes, host of the Shaving
Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoy hearing experts like this
talking about their particular niche of
[SPEAKER_04]: Canvas, I encourage you to check out my
podcast at ShavingFire.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a postcard for it in your
convention bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to get started right in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Anne, why don't we start with you
since you're on the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So historically, Canvas growers have been
taught to pack their Canvas' soil with
[SPEAKER_04]: isolated nutrients that are all nutrients
that the plant needs, but they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily participating with each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is a method that you find successful
to transition towards waking up the soil
[SPEAKER_04]: to rely more on micro communities as a
whole instead of individual supplements?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for me, Shango, the way I think
about things is that once you realize that
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil is really about not only physics
and chemistry, but the missing link in
[SPEAKER_02]: soil that people are really, really
starting to embrace and study and
[SPEAKER_02]: integrate into growing practices is the
biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in many ways, it's the biology
that makes the physics and the chemistry
[SPEAKER_02]: and the movement of things in the soil,
nutrients, minerals, and things like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: move from the soil into the green body of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And normally when I do talks, I have this
particular slide that I really like
[SPEAKER_02]: because every time that I look at it,
I can just sort of sink into the world of
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and a very unique area in the soil
that is nanometers to millimeters right
[SPEAKER_02]: around every single root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that space is called the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rhizosphere is a wild and alive
place that all of us need to know about,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we need to know what goes on in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just pick that word apart a little
bit for folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rhizo means root.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sphere, of course, is about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an area about the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is in the rhizosphere that what you
really have is a biological bazaar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your mind, sort of to conjure up,
somewhere in the Middle East, you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: these traders that are coming in with
wares that none of the other traders have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have this constant ceaseless
back and forth trade stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what the microbial communities are
trading is really pretty mind-blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are producing metabolites from what
they're consuming for energy and some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these metabolites have medicinal effects
on plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some metabolites function as growth
hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's think about this for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have one sector of life, microbial,
and it's making what we in our human world
[SPEAKER_02]: would call products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are supplying those products to
the green bodies of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are plants doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants have their own wares unique to them
that they trade back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's different sorts of nutrients,
carbohydrates or amino acids, fats we're
[SPEAKER_02]: learning, and fats, proteins,
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just sort of lost there in the
biological bazaar for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is what we need to think about
when we think about soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you think about whatever kind of
plant you're growing, that this is really
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're feeding, is you're feeding the
things that are bringing their wares to
[SPEAKER_02]: biological bazaar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember the question?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think about why we're using
synthetic nutrients and why that's so
[SPEAKER_03]: intuitive and why we think about it as
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of PhD in soil microbiology have
thought about this in plant microbe
[SPEAKER_03]: interactions in the rhizosphere and how
microbes interact within the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: rhizosphere for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a huge problem farmers face
with the chemical fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although they're very intuitive,
we can easily tie how the NDK and
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizers are assimilated in the plant
growth and why they're very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they can be applied with precision
in agriculture and in canvas farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The microbiology is less intuitive and it
takes more of a learning curve,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see in agriculture how farmers have
been trained to apply synthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizers for years and decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we see is a decline in soil
health.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very, very interesting because it
actually declines the biology in those
[SPEAKER_03]: soils to facilitate nutrient cycling so
the microbes can actually help liberate
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients and make them bioavailable for
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Microbes are critical to liberate and
maximize what I'm going to call nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: In precision agriculture, canvas farming,
we want to maximize precision.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a precision farming industry and
to do that we want to incorporate all our
[SPEAKER_03]: inputs into the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to do that with the help
of not only maximizing our understanding
[SPEAKER_03]: and applications of fertilizer use,
but with incorporating biology and
[SPEAKER_03]: microbiology to help with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't accomplish that without
incorporating microbes, which as they do
[SPEAKER_03]: in nature, in our growth, cycle nutrients
to maximize the bioavailability of any
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient that we add into our substrate so
the plants can take them up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they covered it really well.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I would add is just to simplify the
process a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we put out organic fertilizer or any
organic ball of nutrients, we have to keep
[SPEAKER_06]: in mind, more or less, we're not directly
feeding that plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're feeding these microbial communities
as a way of cycling those nutrients into
[SPEAKER_06]: the forms that the plant can take up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's important to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other thing I'd like to
consider is just how valuable that process
[SPEAKER_06]: is to the plant in the sense that it's
photosynthesizing all this life,
[SPEAKER_06]: turning it into energy, and putting it
back out through the roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the statistic I read is up to 60%
in certain plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up to the plant to get those back out
in the form of exudates, the sugars,
[SPEAKER_06]: carbons, carbohydrates, and proteins,
to directly feed the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_06]: fungi, cortisol, all these organisms that
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's so much that we still don't
know about the soil and what's going on
[SPEAKER_06]: under our feet in terms of this
interaction that it almost feels arrogant
[SPEAKER_06]: to me to think that we can come up with a
synthetic program that can mimic or come
[SPEAKER_06]: even close to what we get from a healthy
biological process when nature's doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would just end that with saying one
of my favorite quotes is from a good
[SPEAKER_06]: friend of mine, author Jeff Lohenfels,
and he always likes to say, there's no one
[SPEAKER_06]: putting a miracle girl out on the
Redwoods.
[SPEAKER_06]: This process takes care of itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: It grows beautifully well as an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is interesting how we go out into these
beautiful old forests, and they're just
[SPEAKER_04]: fantastically thriving, and yet they're
not buying anything at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's amazing that all plants in
nature depend on microbial associations
[SPEAKER_03]: just like Tad and Anne were talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for us to think that we can avoid that
to maximize the health and development and
[SPEAKER_03]: quality and yield of our plants in
agriculture is naive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think understanding how to integrate
those is a really important next step for
[SPEAKER_03]: us to revolutionize agriculture and merge
that with biology intuitively.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with this next question, we're going to
start back at Gary and Tad and then come
[SPEAKER_04]: on this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So outdoor growing in native soils has
become increasingly popular due to
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis normalizations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can go outside now, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is a regenerative practice for
tired native soils that outdoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: growers can use to rejuvenate local soils
instead of merely shipping in soils from
[SPEAKER_04]: elsewhere?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I'm a firm believer in reusing
soils.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what happens from an agricultural
perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: Farmers aren't bringing in soils
constantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason, as a cannabis farmer,
we need to be any different with our
[SPEAKER_06]: crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of that, for me, that touches
more on soil testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have this microbial side of things
where we have the biology cycling,
[SPEAKER_06]: the nutrients are made and available.
[SPEAKER_06]: But on the other end, we need to look at
what's actually in that soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And getting a soil test and analyzing it
and looking at what sorts of excesses and
[SPEAKER_06]: deficiencies we may have, and then adding
the proper amounts of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_06]: micro macronutrients, to balance that out
goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's essentially what conventional
farming has been for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So tying that aspect of soil testing and
farming with the microbial side of things,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think is really the future of
agriculture, especially when we talk about
[SPEAKER_06]: regenerative agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's right, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to emphasize that I think we
should think about plants as being the
[SPEAKER_03]: foundation of all life on earth as primary
producers and everything else eats those
[SPEAKER_03]: plants or eats things that eat plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And plants don't exist without soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with that logic, soil is actually
the foundation of all life, because we
[SPEAKER_03]: can't really grow plants without substrate
or at least the nutrients in that
[SPEAKER_03]: substrate or soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have to understand that carbon
is the currency of all life on earth,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's definitely the currency of soil
health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so making sure that you can charge
your soil with appropriate carbon allows
[SPEAKER_03]: you to maintain this foundation where you
can have the other ions that can persist
[SPEAKER_03]: in a soil and maintain a healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you look at soil health,
it's completely correlated with carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to help sustain not only
microbial life, but microbes or carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: All life is carbon based.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just the structure and dead material,
carbon related material that can hold onto
[SPEAKER_03]: the nutrients that maximize canine
exchange capacity and the nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: capacity that your plants can grow off of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you have this, if you have a very
healthy soil, you have a carbon rich soil
[SPEAKER_03]: that's full of nutrients, and then you
have a microbial population that helps
[SPEAKER_03]: cycle those nutrients naturally to make
them in bioavailable form so your plants
[SPEAKER_03]: can take them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like what you said, Shago,
about the notice Tad on the Miracle Grow
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Redwood Forest, or I guess it was
Jeff Lomifoss.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the deal, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long before we had agrochemical companies
and pharmaceutical companies, for that
[SPEAKER_02]: matter, all that the botanical world had
and all that we had really for the
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation of our health was our
respective microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all of this stuff that Colin and
Tad have been talking about is part of
[SPEAKER_02]: this new emerging and burgeoning area of
science about the, not just these single
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes, but the microbial communities,
how it is that they are interacting with
[SPEAKER_02]: one another and how it is they're
interacting with their host, whether
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a person or a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more we learn about microbiomes,
the more we are seeing how critical they
[SPEAKER_02]: are for the health and wellbeing of the
plant host or the person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, Shago's question, what are some of
your favorite methods for regenerating
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of dead soils?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I come at this as a person who,
I live here in Seattle and built a garden
[SPEAKER_02]: about 15 years ago, and I will tell you
this, I will tell you one very
[SPEAKER_02]: embarrassing moment for myself as a
biologist and my husband who's a geologist
[SPEAKER_02]: and has written a great deal about soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can laugh now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't bother to really test our soil
as we went about building this garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are one hot August day,
dozens of plants and pots that have been
[SPEAKER_02]: screaming at me for months to get them out
of those pots and into the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're doing a talk on Saturday,
so you can see the crap soil we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was lighter colored than the wall in
this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what my dad told me was, I mean I had
a garden son and I knew about organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, the problem with the soil that
I can see with my eye is lack of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are starving and malnourished in
this soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went into panic mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: First I went into panic mode and then I
got really busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got busy rounding up free and
inexpensive sources of organic matter in
[SPEAKER_02]: my wheelbarrow painted with flames,
which I'm actually now going to repaint
[SPEAKER_02]: with microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I loaded up all kinds of organic
matter from the neighbors' oak leaves to
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee grounds from the coffee shop to I
made friends with arborists in the
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhood to get their wood chips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I was essentially doing was
collecting different sources of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter and I would create mulches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call these meals of wood chips.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the kinds of mulches for my
microbial populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would layer these on the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will tell you this, there is no need
to be digging all of this organic matter
[SPEAKER_02]: into your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really disruptive and disturbing to
all of these tiny, tiny creatures that
[SPEAKER_02]: make up the soil microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after about five years, we went from
soil that was the color of that wall to
[SPEAKER_02]: something that was a dark, chocolatey
color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this led my husband David and I
to realize is that in pretty short order,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can restore life to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do it faster than Mother
Nature can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we were basically mimicking is
everything that happens in a forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, plants have long figured out,
I mean, why do you think leaves fall off
[SPEAKER_02]: deciduous trees and happen to land?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of right on top of the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always think about feeding the soil a
little bit like feeding our dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is that put the food out and life
will come to the food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is how I think about
regenerating soils because I've done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it did not take a century or two that
it could take Mother Nature to get life
[SPEAKER_02]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in some ways, I looked at our soil
initially and I sort of thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh my god, we've got some kind of like
mine reformation site there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it looked like because we're
dealing with, you all know that if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: from Seattle, we've got glacial till and
there's just not much on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we built soil sort of from the top and
then it accumulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, that's one of my favorite
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I get sort of excited about that.
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we're all here as well.
I've got a quick follow up question for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm just learning about
Nodesville.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that you said that
stuck out for me is that when you're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: the rejuvenation of the soil, it doesn't
necessarily mean dig it up, add a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: wildcraft or natural supplements to break
down and then pour it back in the hole.
You're suggesting not breaking up the
mycelium traffic at all and just top
[SPEAKER_04]: dressing for what it sounds like and
letting that soak down and build it
[SPEAKER_04]: without adding a shovel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's pretty much correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, unless you really truly do have a
mine reformation site that's had heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment on it, you do not, rototillers
are really roto killers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my new name for MS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because think about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the tiniest creatures on earth
that live in the soil beneath our feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you take a rototiller or a plow or
some kind of implement and you start
[SPEAKER_02]: stirring that up, all you are doing is
maiming and killing the soil microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if the soil microbiome is a source
of nutrients and there's this biological
[SPEAKER_02]: bizarre and all of these exchanges going
on, you don't want to be cutting that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want that intact and you want that
functioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, you can't really say that
microbes have a brain, but they have ways
[SPEAKER_02]: of sensing what is in my meals with
mulches and what is in mammoth microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: and what is intact compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will figure out a way to get to
that and incorporate it into their bodies
[SPEAKER_02]: and then eventually into the soil and then
into the different body of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we really need to be thinking of
no till and no disturbance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ted, do you want to add something?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a little different perspective on
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with what Anne's talking about in
that situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: From a farming perspective, in cannabis,
I know if you're trying to run a cover
[SPEAKER_06]: crop, you may need to till it back into
the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are times when you have to till
to bring in organic matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I've found works really well with
our growers that are growing in raised
[SPEAKER_06]: beds is to lightly disturb the first
couple inches of the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're not going very deep, but the top
layer there is actually lightly disturbed
[SPEAKER_06]: in nature anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we need to get the nutrients faster
into the rhizosphere for the run cycle of
[SPEAKER_06]: crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: 36 hours after we pull our first crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a little different situation when
you have a garden versus, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're running a personal facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do know guys that are doing
literally no till exactly what Anne
[SPEAKER_06]: described and getting good results too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just got with our soils and the guys
that I've worked with, we're getting
[SPEAKER_06]: slightly better nutrient responses by
hitting the nutrients a little lower into
[SPEAKER_06]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that brings out a good point
is that there is not really any only right
way to do living soils, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're dealing with a living system that's
going to respond to all the efforts that
[SPEAKER_04]: you put into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also it's working as a teammate trying
to make up for the things that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: lacking as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And based on your soil and your finances
and what you may already have in the
[SPEAKER_04]: closet, your solution was not necessarily
to be just like your neighbor's solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is, you know, it takes a little
bit of research, maybe a lot of research
[SPEAKER_04]: and some patience.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the end, you can source out the
solutions for yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start with you and then
we'll go to Tad and then back to Anne.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a great deal of what makes cannabis
thrive, express the bold colors that we
[SPEAKER_04]: love and bag appeal and develop turpines
that just smell great are the
[SPEAKER_04]: micronutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are one of your favorite methods to
increase the presence and bio availability
[SPEAKER_04]: of micronutrients?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it comes back to knowing what
nutrients you have, making sure those
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients are available and having the
means to deliver those nutrients to the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's through a practical application
of knowing what nutrients you have,
[SPEAKER_03]: applying them when you need to and having
the right microbiome, soil microbiome,
[SPEAKER_03]: rice and cereal microbiome helps cycle and
deliver those nutrients that simply.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can test that in a couple of
different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can obviously test your soil as you
can be very conscious of what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: adding in and you can add in everything
with complete precision to the high level
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as any kind of micronutrient you
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you have to understand how those
inputs are transferring up to your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that through nutrient tissue
analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can follow nutrients from the
bottle or from the bag or however your
[SPEAKER_03]: input mode of action gets into your soil
and into your rice sphere and follow those
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can also look at the
nutrients and the responses of your
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So taking that step by step understanding
and everything that we do here and what
[SPEAKER_03]: we're talking about now is an experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's not one right solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your different substrates are going to
have different responses to microbes and
[SPEAKER_03]: different nutrient inputs, micronutrient
inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more complex, the more complex the
system is going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to mirror off of what was
said in that previous conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, soil health and living soil and
the microbiome is a huge thing that's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be moving continuously,
more so the more important agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's this practical balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: In managed systems, we are not going to
make nature because there is this little
[SPEAKER_03]: disturbance that is implicit with managing
soil than managing crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we're trying to do is
practically apply nature where it makes
[SPEAKER_03]: sense in our managed systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think acknowledging the functions of
nature, figuring out how to plug them in
[SPEAKER_03]: to our managed systems and applying them
to get the benefits is the way we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: think about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way we're recreating nature in
a pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way we're recreating nature in
a bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nature is undisturbed for hundreds and
hundreds of years and that's what makes it
[SPEAKER_03]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a huge scale that makes it as
complex as it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we can do as humans is understand
that, bring those in there, acknowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: our limitations, and benefit as good as we
can from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like what Colin just said.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we harvest a plant, we're pulling out
organic matter and we're pulling out
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those need to be replaced and
recycled.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that you don't find
typically in nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's an important aspect to consider.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of micro nutrients, he touched on
soil testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I would say is, so let's say what I
typically find with cannabis is soils tend
[SPEAKER_06]: to be low in manganese, iron, copper,
and some kind of zinc.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we need to get those nutrients
back.
[SPEAKER_06]: The easiest way, if you have a soil test
and you're trying to be organic,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can add the sulfate form to these.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's manganese sulfate or copper
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean we're talking very small amounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I forgot boron's another one in there
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other option, there's a couple
companies that take these sulfates and
[SPEAKER_06]: then chelate them with things like lysine,
like violin would be one, and then albion
[SPEAKER_06]: would be another.
[SPEAKER_06]: By chelating it, what it does is
essentially makes it into a form that the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant can immediately use or take up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are things that can be applied
from a foliar perspective or you can use
[SPEAKER_06]: them as a soil drench and then retest your
soils and see how much that raised the
[SPEAKER_06]: micro nutrient level.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that's one thing that a lot of
people don't consider is these micro
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're also gonna get micro nutrients
from various rock dust.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be careful there.
[SPEAKER_06]: As well as compost and earthworm castings
are a great source.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're probably all in this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're sitting here in this session,
you've probably heard of mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that cultivation practices
where your mycorrhizal fungi populations
[SPEAKER_02]: are high and are functioning are a really
good way to get access to all these
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients that are bound up in the rocks
that are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say rocks, I don't mean big
boulders, but particles, rock particles
[SPEAKER_02]: that are out in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are made of many of these minerals
that TAC just listed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we have this fungi that started a
co-evolutionary relationship with the
[SPEAKER_02]: botanical world millions of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before there were plants, there were
mycorrhizal fungi because they were the
[SPEAKER_02]: decomposers at that time that were
decomposing the organic matter that was
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants came out of the oceans and the
underwater bodies and they struck up
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships with these mycorrhizal fungi
that are every bit as intricate and
[SPEAKER_02]: specialized and intimate as those that go
on between the pollinators and flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we've got this piece of biology
that is long-standing, ancient,
[SPEAKER_02]: and when you've got those mycorrhizal
fungi that can extend, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: functionally basically extending the
plant's roots out into areas of the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: that the plant would otherwise not have
access to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think ways of encouraging the
mycorrhizal fungi so that they're making
[SPEAKER_02]: these things in the soil, these various
micronutrients and minerals, available to
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant, it's sort of like, maybe this
is a little too smart home, smart house
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but you might raise some security
issues, but I would sort of like it if the
[SPEAKER_02]: postal service could deliver my package
not just to my door, but inside the house
[SPEAKER_02]: and inside the cupboard where it is that I
need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think there can sometimes be,
when people are starting to add things
[SPEAKER_02]: into the soil, you really want to make
sure that they're bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one way of doing that, I think,
is to make sure you've got robust
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizal fungi populations and that
you've got a plant that's pushing the
[SPEAKER_02]: exudates out because that fungi is not
going to hand over any minerals unless
[SPEAKER_02]: there's something on the other end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really having this whole system in
the soil between the plant and the
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so we're doing really well on
time, and I'm going to add one more
[SPEAKER_04]: question that I didn't worry about ahead
of time since we're doing so well on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recognize a lot of faces in the audience
of people who are pretty dedicated to
[SPEAKER_04]: living soil, those people that I've spoken
with before, and I think that it would be
[SPEAKER_04]: a missed opportunity to have you three
experts here without asking you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in all of, you travel around,
you're speaking at conventions,
[SPEAKER_04]: hundreds of people are asking you
questions in person via email,
[SPEAKER_04]: other than dammit, getting your soil
tested, which I know would be a kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: uniform answer, other than getting your
soil tested, what would you say is one
piece of advice that you would offer folks
that are developing their living soil for
their farm that they may not be thinking
about and they shouldn't?
You know, people are asking you questions,
they're like, oh my gosh, I wish they
would have known X.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that thing that you just wish you
could let everybody know so that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: more likely to have success?
[SPEAKER_04]: And Colin, I'm going to start with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do think about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking to people all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the biggest gaps is this is
inherent knowledge of what microbial
[SPEAKER_03]: groups actually do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's mycorrhizal fungi,
there's other kinds of saprophytic fungi
[SPEAKER_03]: that are available in products and in
nature, of course, there's many different
[SPEAKER_03]: species and groups of bacteria and they
all have these different functions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you group them all as microbes,
you're missing the resolution that you
[SPEAKER_03]: need for precision in agriculture and
that's what we need if we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: apply microbes with precision,
especially in our cannabis growths.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for example, I know I was just
talking about our musculoskeletal fungi,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do they do?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not automatically capable,
they don't cycle a lot of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're really important symbiotes
that will actually infect your plant root
[SPEAKER_03]: and they'll create more muscular sites in
the cortical cells of your plant roots and
[SPEAKER_03]: they extend out in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's critical because they extend out
beyond the surface area of your roots to
[SPEAKER_03]: take it more nutrients and take it more
water and there's actually an interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: exchange of phosphorus with carbon like
analuted in that particular relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really important, but that's all that
fungi really does and so is it applicable
[SPEAKER_03]: for your hydroponic system?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask yourself that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the limitations of infection
sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the type of things that I would
be asking as a grower if I was digging
[SPEAKER_03]: into the details of microbiology.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do bacteria do?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, bacteria are very enzymatically
capable, they're really not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: infect your plant necessarily beneficial
bacteria, but they continue to cycle
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium, sulfur, micronutrients and make
[SPEAKER_03]: them bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not delivering them to your plant,
they're making them available so your
[SPEAKER_03]: plant can take them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other species of trigoderma that
are really good at cycling carbon in
[SPEAKER_03]: growing out and creating some enzymes for
carbon degradation that breaks down
[SPEAKER_03]: everything in general and there's
interactivity between all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes some time to kind of soak up
information, but if you understand what
[SPEAKER_03]: these groups are doing, you can think
about what the importance is of those in
[SPEAKER_03]: your particular grow and how you can apply
those with confidence that they're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to benefit your plant in the particular
environment that you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are going to be more applicable in
deep water culture systems, some are much
[SPEAKER_03]: more applicable in outdoor growing and
some are across the board beneficial for
[SPEAKER_03]: different reasons, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I talk more with sort of organic
and conventional farmers than really
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis growers, but one of the things
that I always find so interesting,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if I go out to somebody's farm,
and this is what I would encourage
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody to do, particularly if maybe
you've acquired a piece of land recently
[SPEAKER_02]: or you're thinking of doing so,
I think it's really a good idea to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: what you can about the history of that
land and to look around at the landscape
[SPEAKER_02]: and to see how is it that things are
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the native plant
communities like?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kinds of plants do you see really
thriving?
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking with your neighbor farmers,
because one of the, this depends,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe they're not going to tell you where
they fail and they're only going to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you where they succeed, but you want to
know both of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know, okay, so they tried
that, didn't seem like it worked,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think I see a way maybe to tweak
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot to be gained from
talking with other cultivators and from
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the landscape in which you're
growing to just take note of things like
[SPEAKER_02]: the direction that the sun is coming from
and how you're thinking maybe of siding
[SPEAKER_02]: buildings and siding your fields and so
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at an outdoor cannabis farm last
summer and they were getting hammered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what direction the wind
was coming from, but they said,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, we didn't know when we set things up
here that the wind always came out of say
[SPEAKER_02]: the south, but they had to, some of the
plants were staked.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were getting so beaten by the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's paying attention to the physical
and natural features of the piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: property so that you know, so you can take
advantage of what it is that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be my own piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I really like that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that I'm going to talk
about tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of my things, but yeah,
I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, I'm going to take a totally
different approach to this and say,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a whole bunch of people out there
trying to sell you products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Myself included and everyone can call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Evaluate what they have to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the ingredient list.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really take a smart eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you growing the way you're
growing?
[SPEAKER_06]: And just really evaluate that because I
find a lot of people will go out there and
[SPEAKER_06]: they'll grab 30 samples and bring it back
to their garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll apply all of them all at once with
no scientific method and then you really
[SPEAKER_06]: don't know if they did anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would just say challenge the claims
out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look to agriculture if you really want to
see where products are successful.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they can make it in ag or ornamental
greenhouses or horticulture, then that
[SPEAKER_06]: speeds volumes in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, for example, mycorrhizal fungus,
you know, there is information out there
[SPEAKER_06]: that you can educate yourself on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we know that with cannabis,
you're looking at what was formerly called
[SPEAKER_06]: glomus intra-radiaceus and glomus mossier.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's either known to infect cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's also been changed to rhizophage
and arugularis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can look on a label and see if it
has it on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can purchase that product for your
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not buying ectomycorrhizae,
which infects conifers and isn't going to
[SPEAKER_06]: do a whole lot necessarily to help the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can get one specific for your
crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can look at score counts and
say, okay, well this product has this
[SPEAKER_06]: score count.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, is it accurate?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a whole other thing with the Oregon
part of ag.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've done testing on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a starting point at least.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then take it back and run trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think a portion of your garden
should be dedicated to trying out new
[SPEAKER_06]: things and testing out these ideas and
these products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And see if they're worth your time and
your money and something that you want to
[SPEAKER_06]: incorporate in your garden stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the idea of making sure you
look at the ingredients and maybe even ask
[SPEAKER_04]: questions and confirm that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking with Kevin Jodry from
Wonderland Nursery the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, you know, the reason why
we're finding out there's so many hidden
[SPEAKER_04]: things in these products for cannabis is
because historically, we couldn't sue them
[SPEAKER_04]: if they were selling us VX, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to just take it and we had to be
quiet because we were during the
[SPEAKER_04]: Prohibition days.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we're now a legitimate company so
we've got at least some amount of legal
[SPEAKER_04]: standing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these companies that have been
selling products with hidden ingredients
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to be taking a task.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't be afraid of being part of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to go ahead and we've got
time for a couple questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're using this awesome device today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check, check.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all you need to do is when I hand it
or toss it to you, capture it and just
[SPEAKER_04]: talk to it because it's a microphone right
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So who's got a question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, real?
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: We repeat the question, Tad.
[SPEAKER_04]: The microphone didn't kick on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tad, just you repeat it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you repeat it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he was asking if these chelated
micronutrients are affecting the microbial
[SPEAKER_06]: populations if there's a concern for
needing them.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know with copper, for example,
we're talking about parts per million.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a very small amount we're
applying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, copper sulfate, on the other hand,
yes, it's known to damage up to a microbe.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you do want to be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Colin might be a better person to
answer this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in my experience, if they're used
responsibly in small amounts, they don't
[SPEAKER_06]: have a dramatic effect on the microbial
communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's not a risk of happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I personally see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all life is threshold.
[SPEAKER_03]: You add enough of any one thing,
there's a risk of it going to kill off,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, we know that
microbes naturally accumulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're not adding anything to the
microbe.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I already do naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just kind of automates that step or
speeds up that chelation step.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a healthy microbial
population, bacterians, fungi,
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll chelate nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's that process.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can add generators more quickly
available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's that delivery trade-off
that you're negotiating when you add
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, with the seed,
you can just get it all except for what
[SPEAKER_03]: tats and they get that threshold when you
have something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did bring up one thing that I thought
of, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is with mycorrhizal fungus, if you are
applying high levels of phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_06]: then the plant will think that it doesn't
need to form this relationship,
[SPEAKER_06]: which has all these other benefits that
they enlist in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do want to be careful in that regard
with certain nutrients that we're not
[SPEAKER_06]: affecting the way around for these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll talk about that for one second,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a really interesting point
that I didn't want to get into the details
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, there's a lot of research
published papers out there where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: see direct positive correlations.
[SPEAKER_03]: With or negative correlations with
increased phosphorus levels and decreased
[SPEAKER_03]: infection rates of mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And infection sounds like a bad thing,
but you have to have that for the success
[SPEAKER_03]: of that relationship between that plant
and that particular fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have excessive phosphorus,
then there's ranges out there that are
[SPEAKER_03]: critical ranges that really limit the
infection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so thinking about those things,
it's the interactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no black or white.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all these interactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what makes it a little more
complicated to kind of think about between
[SPEAKER_03]: your nutrients and your life and your
plants and the surface of the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's kind of this dynamic thing
that Anna was talking about that we have
[SPEAKER_03]: to consider in a bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to tag in on this at all,
Anna, or shall we just move forward?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think they got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercial fruits and vegetables,
how is this philosophy of execution
[SPEAKER_01]: impacting commercial fruits and
vegetables?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they picking it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will we be able to buy no-till fruits and
vegetables?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's music to my ears.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farming is sort of, let's put it this way,
a small part of farming is maybe the early
[SPEAKER_02]: stages of a revolution and no-till,
which means not using the plow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you hear the word no-till,
that means that farmers not using a plow,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're getting seeds into the ground
by dropping the seed and moving on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in an orchard situation, which is
different because you have these
[SPEAKER_02]: established trees, yet some people are,
plows are also used for weed control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the kind of orchard you want,
and some orchards are doing this,
[SPEAKER_02]: is they're doing cover crops and allowing
so-called weeds to come in and live in the
[SPEAKER_02]: rows between their trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we talked about all of those life
in the soil, and if you're running on an
[SPEAKER_02]: annual basis or more frequently,
some kind of a plow in the rows between
[SPEAKER_02]: your trees, you're ripping that soil,
you're exposing it to erosion,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're killing off a bunch of members in
the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some fruit growers are moving,
yes, more toward no-till, as are some
[SPEAKER_02]: vineyard wine growers, grape growers as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will tell you this, and I don't know
if they're in the room, but the outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis farm that I went to last summer,
they were on the right track with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things that I didn't like
seeing there is that there was open soil
[SPEAKER_02]: in between the rows where they had their
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just looked at that and I thought,
there could be plants growing here,
[SPEAKER_02]: not cannabis plants, but other kinds of
plants that could be walked upon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole thing about a cover crop or
why you want your soil covered is we
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about exudates, the biological
bizarre and all of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: A plant is a food factory for the
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I saw those bear patches,
much like this aisle way right here on
[SPEAKER_02]: that outdoor grow farm, I thought,
wow, they could be feeding a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes that are gonna be feeding the
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would like to see some kind of
cover crop that's walkable upon and get
[SPEAKER_02]: all of this covered, get all of this
covered up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's sort of the idea with some
orchardists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tami, I don't know what to say about
this because he's got a farm where he does
[SPEAKER_02]: grow things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what your, got any ideas
on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: The farm's a little bit misnomer with our
property.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we do grow them on cans and we have a
community unit here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't use them until they're on our
property.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I was gonna say is there's a
great book by, what's your name?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called One Straw Revolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's exactly the title.
[SPEAKER_06]: Asanabe Fukuoka?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should know this on Japanese.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a great book and it talks about
this concept in more detail if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: interested in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think people are looking into
these sorts of types of cultivation
[SPEAKER_06]: outside of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll add on the microbial people.
[SPEAKER_03]: These microbes and microbial
bio-stimulants are the quickest growing
[SPEAKER_03]: sector in general agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And microbes in general, microbial
bio-stimulants are thought to probably
[SPEAKER_03]: significantly displace chemical
fertilizers over the next two decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work with a lot of tomato growers,
a lot of strawberry growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's this economic piece,
piece of this compatibility piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to bring a huge ROI or an ROI that
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has to fit right into those
management practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so not all practices, I think,
are up to the conventional farming
[SPEAKER_03]: practices, but it's getting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, quickly growing every quarter
second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while we're thinking about the actual
application to business, it's important to
[SPEAKER_04]: remember, too, that the way that consumers
are going are towards living soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want pesticides they use.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want synthetic chemicals used.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the industry, one way or another,
is headed towards living soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a matter of fact, it's a marketing win
for you to say, that your plants are grown
[SPEAKER_04]: in living soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're thinking like, oh,
man, this is just something else I'm going
[SPEAKER_04]: to have to spend my time on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe think of it both as
self-education, but also giving some help
[SPEAKER_04]: to the marketing department, because it's
going to make your product more desirable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to thank Colin Bell from Mammoth
Microbes, Ted Hussey from Keep It Simple
Organics, and Nick Lay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Colin is at the Mammoth Microbes booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to chat with him further,
and Ann will actually be signing her book.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have copies available,
too?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can buy copies of her book also at
the Mammoth Microbes booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ted has got his booth at the Keep It
Simple Organics booth.
