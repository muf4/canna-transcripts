[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing to see how much cannabis
extraction has evolved in such a short
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you looked at cannabis on a
historical timeline, there would be
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers and hash for millennia,
and then right at the end of the timeline,
[SPEAKER_02]: suddenly humans start using alcohol,
butane, and carbon dioxide, and even hair
[SPEAKER_02]: straighteners, to remove the essential
oils of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beginning of normalization has created
a surging demand for all sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts, including DAB oil, inputs to
make edibles, and full extract cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: oil, or FECO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each of these processes demand the right
technology, employed by a knowledgeable
[SPEAKER_02]: technician.

[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest today is A.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Braddock.
[SPEAKER_02]: A.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: is CEO of Eden Labs, one of the original
leaders of cannabis extraction technology,
[SPEAKER_02]: reaching all the way back to the early
days of medical in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: With normalization, Eden has become
possibly the most prominent extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: technology company in the U.S.,
and one of the top 10 fastest growing
[SPEAKER_02]: women led companies in Seattle,
Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: A.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: not only leads Eden, but she's a thought
leader industry-wide as well, and often
[SPEAKER_02]: travels the world to speak at
international cannabis conferences.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a founding supporter of the Cannabis
Women's Alliance, Women Grow, and Women of
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's also a board member of the NCIA,
the NCIA's Federal Policy Council,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Cannabis Alliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we're going to talk with A.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: about the rise of CO2 extraction
technology, and the importance of kindness
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, A.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so delighted to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited to be talking about Eden
and your experience with extraction for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Eden was in the botanical
extraction business well before cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kinds of other extractions were you
designing prior to getting into cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the founder of the company,
Fritz Chest, began doing extractions in
[SPEAKER_01]: about 1994.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, cannabis was always a part
of that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a lot of different kinds of
botanicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, for instance, he was one of
the first to advertise in high times for
[SPEAKER_01]: an extraction system in, I think,
94 or 95, and that was a small ethanol
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he put a large system in San
Francisco in 1996 when Proposition 215
[SPEAKER_01]: passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the other botanicals,
there's a wide array.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's biofuels, nutraceuticals,
herbs for acupuncturists, herbalists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the breadth of extraction
knowledge that he has across multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: botanical structures and industries is
really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it surprises me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I thought I knew your Eden Labs
background in cannabis, but I had no idea
[SPEAKER_02]: that Fritz had gotten started so early in
the San Francisco scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually when I was living down
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He obviously has had an affinity for
cannabis medicine a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you find that you were well positioned
because of that experience when the first,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when Washington and Colorado
first broke out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fritz was probably like, finally,
I get a chance to apply my technology in
[SPEAKER_02]: functioning markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, you know, as he said back in
the mid 90s, you know, if it wasn't for
[SPEAKER_01]: California, Eden Labs would be a part-time
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be a hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, he has been doing this quite a
while and it definitely was a boon to Eden
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the entire industry to have
someone with his background and experience
[SPEAKER_01]: when those markets went live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, later on for Colorado and
in Washington in 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if he was beginning, you know,
like you said, if it weren't for
[SPEAKER_02]: California, it'd be a part-time job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that your extractors are used
across other industries for different
[SPEAKER_02]: botanicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: At what point did the threshold kind of
get passed where it went from just being,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Fritz and one or two other
people to, oh gosh, you know, it looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like we need to start hiring people
because the cannabis part of our business
[SPEAKER_02]: is growing so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that tipping point for especially
for cannabis was about 2009 and then
[SPEAKER_01]: really kicked in in 2010.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can imagine at that same time,
you know, your early sales were to medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis companies in Washington and
Colorado and in California, which you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: already been selling to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, a lot of those new
companies wanted to use your technology,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they didn't have access to traditional
financing yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while, you know, while the Eden
machines are, you know, are worth the
[SPEAKER_02]: money, they're also not something that a
lot of these new companies, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: had in financing right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can imagine that you had to do some
pretty creative financing to help these
[SPEAKER_02]: companies get the ball rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also making sure that Eden was first to
market in this groundbreaking industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, those early years were very
challenging for people to be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: in to, you know, get equipment that would
really help them be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was definitely a lot of
creativity and there still is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's still an issue, obviously,
with, you know, not having access to the
[SPEAKER_01]: federal banking system in order.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, companies can't get lines of
credit, you know, and you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: completely rely on investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, often that can be
problematic, having those two worlds come
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has been challenging and it still
is, but it's certainly a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, in the early days of
medical, it was such a legal gray area
[SPEAKER_02]: that it was a lot harder to find,
you know, even angel investment capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're all pretty, well,
at least fairly confident that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: here to stay, it's a lot easier to get
individual investment now than it was in
[SPEAKER_02]: those early days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in addition to the early
companies not necessarily having the
[SPEAKER_02]: financing for such a, you know,
fine product as the extractors,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a lot of the owner-operators
didn't have proper science backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you make up for operator error as
they run your machines?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a poor operator getting poor
results looks bad for Eden, not because
[SPEAKER_02]: the machine is doing anything wrong,
but because the quality of what's coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the machine and then is going for
sale or to a patient or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it might not be up to quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they say, oh, it was run on an
Eden machine when actually the machine was
[SPEAKER_02]: fine, but the operator's the one who
doesn't have the experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do as a company to help soften
the likelihood of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, several different things,
but the foundation of all of that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: is why Fritz started engineering CO2
systems to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was doing all kinds of different
botanicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we mentioned earlier, one of the things
that he had a hard time extracting with
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol because he started with ethanol
systems was kava kava and it would not
[SPEAKER_01]: extract well in ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, all right, well,
I need to try some temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he started looking around at different
CO2 extraction systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were only a couple of companies at
the time and they were huge international
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the systems were very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were fully automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were fussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, none of these companies had
any idea about, you know, extracting
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily resinous materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said, all right, well, I don't want
a system like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want something that's simple to
operate, that will not break down,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, I can run comfortably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what he designed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, 22 years later,
the systems, having been based on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: are very easy to operate and they are
extremely reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, as a company, you know,
we obviously were extremely invested in
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry and we really want all of
our people to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have an internal training for those
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have techs that they can call to help
them with things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a really good, obviously,
a network, having been in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: this many years, that we share information
with a lot of our clients and we pass some
[SPEAKER_01]: of that stuff on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are agreeable to do that,
obviously, some of the technology or the
[SPEAKER_01]: protocols that they come up with are their
IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't share that, but the systems are,
they're designed to help people be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've gone through many different
reiterations of the system at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just released a new version this
last year and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can imagine, especially in the early
days when turnover for lab staff was
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty consistent, that there must've been
some frustration from your training
[SPEAKER_02]: department because just as you got a
company's lab staff trained up and they
[SPEAKER_02]: could use the machine correctly,
they were moving on for one reason or
[SPEAKER_02]: another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, oh man, we gotta start
all over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can imagine that as far as startup and
moving into a new industry, that must've
[SPEAKER_02]: been one of the early frustrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and what way we've dealt with that
is, we train the operators on this system
[SPEAKER_01]: that they get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we train up to four people at a
time from any given company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of their warranty is hooked into
the fact that a certified trained person
[SPEAKER_01]: is running that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they have somebody else do it,
that avoids their warranty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives some impetus to always have an
operator who has been trained and knows
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has worked very well for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a really great strategy to
tie having a properly trained person to
[SPEAKER_02]: the warranty itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the early days, I've seen all sorts of
different people in different labs running
[SPEAKER_02]: your machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, do they know what they're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually the industry has been,
my opinion, been held back quite a bit by
[SPEAKER_01]: a lack of a real understanding of
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you, Shankar, I know you
mentioned earlier, about all the traveling
[SPEAKER_01]: that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the primary reason is just
trying to get in front of people to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about extraction and why extraction is so
important to this moving this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: forward, especially on legalization,
because it's hard to legalize on medical
[SPEAKER_01]: without a clean, pure product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the reasons why when I
came in as CEO, I wanted to brand the
[SPEAKER_01]: company as primarily as CO2 and ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make all kinds of different systems
using all sorts of different solvents,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this industry needed an easy path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to argue with those two
extraction methodologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to go ahead and compare CO2 to
BHO, but let's do that after the first
[SPEAKER_02]: break here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to take a first break and be
right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is A.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Braddock, CEO of Eden Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well-known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_02]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_02]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The terpenes sold by True Terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are certified organic, non-GMO,
and food grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that they are extracted from
real plant sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no solvents of any kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, terpenes from True Terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, but you can stay and stack
them with better results, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I mean is other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you stack those terpenes to make
your blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_02]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: True Terpenes also have strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset
Sherbet, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: True Terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_02]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_02]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_02]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
True Terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_02]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_02]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: True Terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Choose True Terpenes for a top-shelf
experience.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shangolo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our guest this week is A.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Braddock, CEO of Eden Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, at the end of the last set,
A.C., you were saying how one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that you wanted to do as you came
in as CEO was to start to play this
[SPEAKER_02]: evangelist role for extraction and for
easy-to-use CO2 machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a lot of people have been,
you know, in the early days, they were
[SPEAKER_02]: making B.H.O., butane hash oil,
and in the early, early days, people were
[SPEAKER_02]: blasting outside, which of course was
really dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things that a lot of people
really like about CO2 is that there is no
[SPEAKER_02]: residue left in the product, and it's not
a combustible hydrocarbon, which a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people are concerned about, you know,
getting any residue out of it because it
[SPEAKER_02]: can be a carcinogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, as part of your evangelist
presentation, to people, what do you say
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're comparing CO2 to B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_02]: and why CO2 is such a great choice for
folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, number one, the marketability.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even in the supplements
industry, many years ago, they started
[SPEAKER_01]: moving over to CO2 from hexane,
and they used it as a marketing tool in
[SPEAKER_01]: their packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a movement in this
country for sustainable, environmentally
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly, organic products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it's not just cannabis,
it's all industries, because most of our
[SPEAKER_01]: food products are currently extracted with
hexane, which is very toxic, and in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: has been banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that's usually made with a light
hydrocarbon from many countries in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: are not allowed to be sold in Europe,
but they are allowed to be sold in the U
[SPEAKER_01]: .S.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we have a little bit of a problem
with, you know, what we get as human
[SPEAKER_01]: consumables for many different things,
and that includes pesticides and our
[SPEAKER_01]: foodstuffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in cannabis, you know, we have this
spotlight on us about the kind of products
[SPEAKER_01]: that we make and how they're grown,
which is good, but we want to shine that
[SPEAKER_01]: light across multiple industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, as I said earlier,
Eden makes all kinds of different systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: and including butane and propane systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why we started, again,
we started focusing on this is because,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you said, in the early days,
there were so many non-experts utilizing
[SPEAKER_01]: butane, because it was inexpensive to get
into, and there were horrific accidents,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was really an Achilles heel for the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The media was having a field day with it,
and we needed an alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these days, there are many companies
who make really good butane and propane
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just requires time to do the
post-processing and an understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main problems with any solvent,
really, especially, you know, butane or
[SPEAKER_01]: propane, is it goes through pipelines,
and you get what they call, quote,
[SPEAKER_01]: unquote, mystery oil in there,
which is basically pipelines and
[SPEAKER_01]: lubricants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as companies are being
responsible in sourcing really clean
[SPEAKER_01]: solvents and then purging it and handling
the oils properly, it's a viable
[SPEAKER_01]: production method, and especially since
different kinds of solvents produce
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we deal with people, we try and
find out, okay, what are you trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you trying to make inedible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you trying to make shatter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you trying to do vape pins?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because different methodologies are better
for different product lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a really insightful point
that you mentioned about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cleanliness of BHO or PHO or what have
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got a bad reputation in the early days,
but it wasn't because of the BHO itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was because the state of the industry
was so young that the proper techniques
[SPEAKER_02]: and the education to remove the residual
solvents just didn't exist in the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: yet, and you had a lot of non-science,
inexperienced people doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: post-processing, and then it would go out
and, you know, you could taste it or it
[SPEAKER_02]: would snap on the nail or whatever,
and people could tell that there was still
[SPEAKER_02]: residual BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point where the industry is now,
through education and hiring more
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific lab staffs, more or less BHO
and other light hydrocarbons are gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaner than they ever were in the early
days of medical, and a lot of that fear,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's probably time for that to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it also still falls back on the
mission and focus of whatever the company
[SPEAKER_01]: is, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of the people who really,
who understand this is a long-term play,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is not a short-term play, it's just not
about making a bunch of money quickly,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anybody who's in this industry
knows that at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're either going to self-regulate
and be an example for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, or you're going to be in it for
a money grab, and it's pretty easy to pick
[SPEAKER_01]: out who those companies are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is the general public can't
differentiate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and there's not testing for that
that's mandatory in the United States
[SPEAKER_02]: either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to self-educate and then find
some sort of brand that you like and then
[SPEAKER_02]: stick with that brand loyalty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes for a really exclusive
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely hinders the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons I appreciate your
inviting me on this talk today,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, because the more we can help educate
each other, and the general public,
[SPEAKER_01]: and come to some consensus on the
messaging that we're going to be bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: as recreational continues, hopefully,
to expand, we don't want to get into a
[SPEAKER_01]: scenario where the culture of this
industry flips, and we're doing same-old,
[SPEAKER_01]: same-old business, and we've got
Monsanto-type companies, and there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: much potential for the cannabis industry
to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our food consumption, civil rights,
there's just so many different things that
[SPEAKER_01]: are what keep so many of these companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tenacity comes from the passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree with you, and I think that
a lot of us who used to work in the
[SPEAKER_02]: medical industry actually have that fear,
and we watch it because the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant itself, it teaches, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people who tend to be attracted to
cannabis and whole plant medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: of which I know you're also a big advocate
for, like I am, we saw the kinds of people
[SPEAKER_02]: who used to be attracted to the medical
industry, and as states become
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational and licensed and new forms of
investment come in and the players change
[SPEAKER_02]: out, our entire industry is at risk to
becoming more of a commodity and lose a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of that original spirit that I think
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's got to be enough good players
in the industry who want to keep the
[SPEAKER_02]: quality high, who want to try to stay as
close to a whole plant as we can,
[SPEAKER_02]: and to continue to think about the health
of the consumers and the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes people like you evangelizing
that and to remind people of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some really amazing
companies in this industry, and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some companies that aren't so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can help bring them in,
but you touched on it, it's the investors
[SPEAKER_01]: and other business people who are looking
at this as a green rush who come in and
[SPEAKER_01]: expect big numbers and take equity out of
small businesses and who are already under
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendous amount of pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: To even just stay in business with these
people who are just talking about numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having that flavor start taking over
what we're doing, it's not where we want
[SPEAKER_01]: to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's disheartening, that's for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we go to the second commercial,
I want to talk a little bit about flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: of CFS.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, several years ago, I was CEO of
an extraction company and we used Eden
[SPEAKER_02]: machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as CEO and as our evangelist,
one of the things that I often had to work
[SPEAKER_02]: to convince people about CO2 was that it
had flavor and it could produce really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice dabs compared to BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of what my shtick was when I
talked to people was, in the early days,
[SPEAKER_02]: people were not really sure in the lab how
to make a fine, tasty dab oil because they
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't familiar with the machines yet and
the post-processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were just cooking the turps
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't the issue of CO2,
it was the issue of inexperienced people
[SPEAKER_02]: using CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even today, as the technology has
gotten better and as laboratory teams have
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten better, there's still this
remaining myth of that, like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, BHO is always going to taste the
best and CO2 is not going to taste very
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know because I adore CO2 dabs,
I know the taste is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you say when people kind of slough
off CO2 and they say, oh, it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: the flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm sure you get this pretty often
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, we've been getting that for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the stem of it is from where
we are generally where we are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I look at it is we are still in
bathtub gin mentality about cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people only care about the
amount of THC and it being inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that lends itself to trying to produce
a product with as much THC in it as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the early and early on CO2 was really
trying to compete with the CO2 operators
[SPEAKER_01]: were trying to compete with trying to get
as much THC in their oil as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they over processed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would take it out of the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would post process it and post
process it and continue to concentrate it
[SPEAKER_01]: until the THC levels were high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, then you've vaporized off
all of the light essential oils which are
[SPEAKER_01]: all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for about five years, actually I've
been trying to get our clients because our
[SPEAKER_01]: systems can fractionate off terpes
separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course what they were doing is
they were taking all that post process,
[SPEAKER_01]: post process oil and then trying to put it
into a smokable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they really should have been
doing is just do an extraction of the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes which come off really quickly
because they're light essential oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come off in like 15 to 45 minutes,
squirt that out, set it aside,
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to run, take the lipids and waxes
out of that bulk oil and reintroduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes so you have a whole plant
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to use additives for
fluidity in the pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, at this point we have multiple
clients who are doing a one process where
[SPEAKER_01]: they just run subcritical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is starting to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's starting to happen because the
public, especially I think in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northwest and in California and some areas
where all the pot nerds quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we are, aren't concerned with having
high levels of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a full profile cannabinoid and
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want, one of the things that I'm really
seeing especially here in Washington is
[SPEAKER_01]: very high CBD strains utilized with very
low THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the connoisseur products and
they're just starting to catch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to see more and more of
that because the high THC market is
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely limited but the full cannabinoid
profile, full terpene entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a massive market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and certainly one that's gonna keep
on growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna go ahead and take our second
and last break.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is A.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Braddock, CEO of Eden Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using pesticides when growing cannabis has
been common for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nowadays though, we know better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that most pesticides formulated
for food crops have never been tested for
[SPEAKER_02]: use with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been tested to be eaten in tiny
doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have not been tested to be inhaled
and especially not concentrated into a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chemical residues from pesticides are not
healthy for anyone but they are especially
[SPEAKER_02]: dangerous for patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: For commercial cannabis growers,
this has become very impactful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis enthusiasts and patients have
gotten educated enough that they avoid
[SPEAKER_02]: growers who used pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, but states across the
country have begun making pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: testing mandatory on all licensed cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: The time has come to find a better way to
fight garden pests than covering your
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a better way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let some good bugs fight your bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beneficial insects and predatory mites
have come a long way since we were buying
[SPEAKER_02]: ladybugs online and putting them in the
grow room and just hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Natural Enemies Biocontrol can help you
solve pest issues without using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Natural Enemies founder Shane Young
learned best practices from working in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ornamental plant industry and has
fine-tuned those strategies specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: for large cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane works with commercial cannabis
clients across the country to ensure that
[SPEAKER_02]: they keep their crops safe and pest-free
without the use of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Natural Enemies has proven solutions for
spider mites, aphids, thrips, russet
[SPEAKER_02]: mites, broad mites, shoreflies,
whitefly, and others too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can rely on Natural Enemies for
expertise and excellent service.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is AC Braddock, CEO of Eden
[SPEAKER_02]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right before the break, you were
talking about the difference between super
[SPEAKER_02]: and subcritical and that some folks were
switching to subcritical so that they
[SPEAKER_02]: could get more flavor profile because the
future of cannabis is not just THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's whole plant, it's flavor,
it's taste, and it's healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of folks are not familiar with
the difference between super and
[SPEAKER_02]: subcritical.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I really know about it is that people
wanted to try to avoid using subcritical
[SPEAKER_02]: simply because the run took so much longer
and it was less number of runs they could
[SPEAKER_02]: do in a 24-hour period.
[SPEAKER_02]: But will you kind of break that out for us
what the difference between super and
[SPEAKER_02]: subcritical extraction is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the wonderful thing about CO2,
unlike a lot of other different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: solvents, is that it's very tunable where
you can run a material through it of wide
[SPEAKER_01]: array of temperatures and pressures to get
out all kinds of different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's primarily useful cannabis is to
be able to separate out the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile and that, as I was saying earlier,
that's a low pressure, low temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's under 1,100 psi and at low
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also, as I said to you,
how the market's changing a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, any kind of quality product that
you make, I don't care what it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: takes longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wines, cheeses, I mean, the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that's artisan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, anything that's artisan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we want this market to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to be artisan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to be small business.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to be a micro business as
opposed to a macro.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certainly room for macro,
but the more small to medium sized
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses we have in cannabis or anything
is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the subcritical will pull lots of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also need to then go up to
supercritical to pull a lot of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because THC can sometimes be hard to pull
out, especially THCA, which is another
[SPEAKER_01]: product which is coming up and that people
don't have a really clear understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: about is having a product with THCA in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially for medical patients because
you're gonna get all the pain benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: without all the psychoactive parts in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a wide range of temperature and
pressure to be able to create a recipe
[SPEAKER_01]: that's unique to your product and pulling
out different cannabinoid profiles at
[SPEAKER_01]: different places in the extraction
process, which gives you IP, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely important for this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you start going back and
forth between pharmaceutical versus
[SPEAKER_01]: nutraceutical or pharmaceutical versus a
cottage market.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we're going to be able to have
some traction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as these markets get larger,
I would think that the sales of Eden Lab
[SPEAKER_02]: extractors to particular locales in the
country or heck even the world is a
[SPEAKER_02]: leading indicator of the next really
relevant cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that to be the case?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, where do you think are gonna be
the next hotspots because that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're shipping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously California.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a huge market.
[SPEAKER_01]: East Coast, there are several states that
look like they're gonna be Pennsylvania,
[SPEAKER_01]: their laws only doing concentrates,
which I don't necessarily agree with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's a medical benefit for
flour as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the technology going forward to be
able to separate out molecules to pull out
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG for instance, which is one of my
favorites because it's great for pain and
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But moving all that forward, so we have a
distributor ship now actually as a company
[SPEAKER_01]: in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tapping into some of those European
markets like Israel, Australia,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are several different, Germany,
the UK is gearing up quickly I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, South America, it's kind of
disturbing to see because I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington and the West Coast should be
kind of leading this technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of our federal regulations,
other places in the world are gaining
[SPEAKER_01]: traction, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, lots of clinical trials are going
on all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be nice to have it be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so disappointing to live in
Washington and have us be one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: firsts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then because of this dual layer of our
federal laws and then the confusion on
[SPEAKER_02]: implementation at the state level,
I feel like we're in Washington,
[SPEAKER_02]: the example of how not to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as the US government stopped
international pressure for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is amazing how quickly it broke out
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as we stopped strong arming people
into not using cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the things that Washington have
done has been very, very disappointing and
[SPEAKER_01]: heart wrenching for many people that I
know, especially people who were in
[SPEAKER_01]: medical previously and have moved into the
502 market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But especially with how medical has been
handled here in the state, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredibly hypocritical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shame that the patients were the
first ones and the medical providers were
[SPEAKER_02]: the first ones to provide them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, they're the ones who are
left holding the bag in the new system
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But heck, we could do a whole show just on
Washington's failures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's move right along.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know you and I are both serious whole
plant advocates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know the answer to this
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I figure Beth's time is now to ask
you, so what is lost?
[SPEAKER_02]: During a co2 extraction?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's from what I'm
understanding from your answer,
[SPEAKER_02]: sub is going to provide more of the
original plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's what's what's in the plant that
you would get when you took it or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, combust it that's not in the oil
that comes after it's derived by a co2
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can't say that I exactly know
the answer to that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, different methodologies will
leave different things behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between smoking and co2,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I do know that sometimes when
I smoke, I can become very achy depending
[SPEAKER_01]: on what strain it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that never happens when I ingest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not only what the difference in
the extraction method, but also what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens physiologically with how the plant
works in your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm asking you things that that you
don't have ready answers to, how about
[SPEAKER_02]: this one?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, when I've spoken to medical
doctors about dabbing, some think that we
[SPEAKER_02]: will eventually find out that dabbers are
inhaling terpenes in a volume and in a
[SPEAKER_02]: method that can be toxic to humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously these studies have not been
done yet because we would know about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you are sure around a lot
of folks studying oils, thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: oils, developing the technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are your personal thoughts on the
safety of dabbing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, and that has that is becoming
quite a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, another new trend that we're hearing
about is that a lot of BHO products,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people who are dabbing are now
taking a BHO product and taking terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: from a CO2 extraction and putting that on
the BHO product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously you're going to have a pretty
significant terpene profile there and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes are are light hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, going back to a whole plant
philosophy, if you've got a plant and it
[SPEAKER_01]: never has more than, you know,
let's say, 20 percent terpene profile and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're mixing it together to create a 75
percent terpene profile, I would say that
[SPEAKER_01]: there should be room for concern there
because it doesn't naturally occur that
[SPEAKER_01]: way and it probably doesn't actually occur
that way for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like super charging it and your
body may have never seen anything like it
[SPEAKER_02]: before and know how to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, at some point it could become
poisonous or, you know, it's just too
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we, you know, continually
need to look at the plant as it is and
[SPEAKER_01]: what it offers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that is why this industry exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to suddenly take a sharp turn has to be
thought, should be thought through and
[SPEAKER_01]: considered carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think this is a fun question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that I need to go find myself a
really good medical doctor, respiratory
[SPEAKER_02]: nerd and get them on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will ask you about that as soon as we're
done here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to finish this show with a real
serious, well, not real serious,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a really direct business question
because we've talked on this show before
[SPEAKER_02]: about trademark and licensing and the
importance of companies to continually
[SPEAKER_02]: defend their brand marks and their
trademarks because if they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly defending the use of their
product names and of their marks,
[SPEAKER_02]: that over time, their trademark gets
diluted and it becomes indefensible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I have seen a lot of
different extraction machines and so many
[SPEAKER_02]: of them look like your original machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question for you is that,
you know, I'm assuming that you're being
[SPEAKER_02]: copied again and again by other extraction
companies seeking to catch up with Eden's
[SPEAKER_02]: lead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that you have to strongly
defend your design patents?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's a little difficult,
too, with CO2 because CO2 was invented in
[SPEAKER_01]: World War II.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not a new process by any
stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously some of the different tweaks
and how we put a system together is
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly patentable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, there are many, in the last two
years, I would say there's a dozen more
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction companies who have come into
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to hang on to your market
share while you're educating the public on
[SPEAKER_01]: what the differences in the systems are,
because some of these systems that come
[SPEAKER_01]: in, you know, without naming names,
you know, one company, that I know of,
[SPEAKER_01]: their 100 liter takes 64 hours to do an
extraction, you know, or hours would take
[SPEAKER_01]: seven to 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really detrimental to the
operators and the businesses who get these
[SPEAKER_01]: systems who don't understand the
differences because they're going to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can't have that kind of overhead
and have that kind of length of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In an extraction process, but it goes back
to the whole extraction piece on every
[SPEAKER_01]: level in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: With as many companies that are popping up
building extraction technologies,
[SPEAKER_02]: are you to the point yet that you have got
dedicated people on staff whose job it is
[SPEAKER_02]: to defend your patents and to look for
infringement?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just your engineers occasionally
come across one and then you hand it over
[SPEAKER_02]: to the lawyers?
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably primarily just let our legal
team deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I guess as a business owner,
at some point you have to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you going to spend a lot of your
time looking at your competitors and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to compete?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you going to focus on what you do
best?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did make that decision a few years
ago that we are going to do what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: always done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just do R&D and look at the
science and continue to make better
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction systems because that takes a
tremendous amount of time and energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just that they're constantly chasing
other people is a distraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: From an idealist point of view,
I actually really love that answer
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, I understand the
importance of defending design patents.
[SPEAKER_02]: The importance of holding on to IP for a
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm also in the old school idea of
information yearns to be free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also like rapid proto testing and
evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I find it encouraging that you are
leading Eden in a way that you're all
[SPEAKER_02]: like, well, we'll defend when we have to,
but let's just make the next thing and
[SPEAKER_02]: then we'll just always be ahead of the
crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, it's like I don't care
that Eden is the biggest company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want us to be the best company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it all comes down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we're the best, our clients
will be successful and they'll be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: then become pillars of mission and in this
industry that will hopefully continue the
[SPEAKER_01]: tipping point in the direction this
culture wants it to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, AC, I know you have got an
exceptionally busy schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate you peeling off an
hour to spend with us so that we can get
[SPEAKER_02]: caught up.
