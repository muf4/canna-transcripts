[SPEAKER_00]: Going into the California election three
weeks ago, there was a powerful schism in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone agreed that Proposition 64
releasing cannabis prisoners from
[SPEAKER_00]: incarceration was a necessary and overdue
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone also pretty much agreed that
an adult use law was necessary and overdue
[SPEAKER_00]: as well in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: The schism was whether or not you thought
the design of the cannabis market as
[SPEAKER_00]: spelled out in Proposition 64 was the
right way to legalize in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that the proposition has passed,
the conversation for the next two episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: of Shaping Fire are going to focus on what
comes next in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's episode, we're going to talk
with Amanda Ryman of Drug Policy Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about the new
opportunities for entrepreneurs looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a move in the new adult use market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to be talking about the
forthcoming state rulemaking process and
[SPEAKER_00]: lay out some timetables for
implementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the next episode, we'll present
part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: In part two, I'll talk with Hezekiah Allen
of the California Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk with him about the concerns of
heritage cannabis farmers in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California's Emerald Triangle and the
actions they will have to take to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: voice in the creation of the state's new
adult use market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also have a detailed discussion
about market consolidation in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: how we might preserve diversity in the
cannabis market and save the family farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week's recording does not sound quite
as clear as our usual episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran into some technical issues while
recording our guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The content is still very engaging though,
so I encourage you to turn your volume or
[SPEAKER_00]: treble down just a touch and enjoy the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Amanda Ryman,
manager of marijuana law and policy at
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug Policy Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that role, she develops every aspect of
DPA's marijuana reform work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryman joined DPA in 2012 after working
with the famous Berkeley Patients Group
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispensary as director of research and
patient services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryman has conducted numerous studies on
medical marijuana dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, and the use of marijuana as
treatment for addiction, regularly
[SPEAKER_00]: presenting her research at the conferences
of the American Public Health Association,
[SPEAKER_00]: American Psychiatric Association,
International Cannabinoid Research
[SPEAKER_00]: Society, and the Harm Reduction Coalition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryman served as the first chairwoman of
the Medical Cannabis Commission for the
[SPEAKER_00]: City of Berkeley, currently serves on the
Cannabis Regulatory Commission for the
[SPEAKER_00]: City of Oakland, and has consulted with
various cities, states, and nations on the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of medical marijuana policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryman is currently a lecturer in the
School of Social Welfare at the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of California, Berkeley, where she teaches
drug and alcohol policy, substance abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, and sexuality and social work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryman earned her BA in psychology from the
University of Illinois, Chicago,
[SPEAKER_00]: and her master's degree in social work
from the Jane Addams College of Social
[SPEAKER_00]: Work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryman moved to Oakland in 2002 to attend
the University of California, Berkeley,
[SPEAKER_00]: where she earned her PhD in social work in
2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryman's dissertation, Cannabis Care,
was the first study focusing on how
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana dispensaries operate as
healthcare service providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Amanda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad that you could make time with
your busy schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are things calming down for you a little
bit more now that the election is over?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we are really excited that Prop
64 had victory here in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're also looking to the horizon and
with questions about what the new
[SPEAKER_01]: administration means for this new
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's kind of scared about what the
next move of the president-elect may be,
[SPEAKER_00]: but luckily, we don't have to talk about
that one today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to tackle California itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, everybody's excited because
now there's more clarity than there had
[SPEAKER_00]: been before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before, you know, medical existed,
but it was, you know, parts of it were not
[SPEAKER_00]: quite as legal as some folks wanted
entrepreneur-wise to get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now with a clear green light from the
state, folks are ready to jump in and to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring their skills from other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that California is going to be
a multi-billion dollar industry in and of
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the number of participants,
though, do we have any idea of how many
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies will likely be formed
in California now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there could be thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're not just talking about
companies that actually touch the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So companies that grow the plant,
that process the plant, that distribute
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, but all of the ancillary
services that go along with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, especially in the tech sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that given that California has
such a reputation of being innovators when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to technology, that we're going
to see a huge cannabis tech sector in
[SPEAKER_01]: California as well as the agricultural
sector that comes with actually producing
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a really good point to
make because there are so many people who
[SPEAKER_00]: see the opportunity in cannabis and they
want to participate, but it doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have to go through the highly
regulatory structure of getting a license
[SPEAKER_00]: or even dealing with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many support opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the licenses themselves,
though, let's talk about those and break
[SPEAKER_00]: those out a little bit because California
has gotten more, a higher, more variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses than any other state has
legalized at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the different licenses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the licenses were really outlined
first under our Medical Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulation and Safety Act, which was
passed in 2015 by Governor Brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you mentioned, even though we've had
medical cannabis in California for 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years, we've been lacking a state level
regulatory system, meaning that anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: that's operating a medical cannabis
currently in California is doing so under
[SPEAKER_01]: a local license, and this is primarily
just retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really haven't seen the licensing of
cultivation, manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our Medical Cannabis Regulation and
Safety Act outlined licenses for this
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose, and then Prop 64 adopted that
licensing structure with a few key
[SPEAKER_01]: differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both the medical program and Prop 64
outlined licensing not just for different
[SPEAKER_01]: activities, but different levels of
production within those activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, so there's different
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we cover cultivation, testing,
manufacturing, transportation,
[SPEAKER_01]: retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within each license category,
there's room for small growers versus big
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, delivery services versus brick
and mortar dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even within each type of license,
there's variability based on how big you
[SPEAKER_01]: are and the exact type of company you want
to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, volatile extractions via
butane and other combustibles is regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: differently than non-volatile extractions,
such as temperature or agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we'll find that California
going ahead and blessing the kind of model
[SPEAKER_00]: that they used for medical with some
changes and making it adult use will have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more success like in Colorado,
which used a similar model of blessing
[SPEAKER_00]: what they already have versus the kind of
mess that they have in Washington where
[SPEAKER_00]: they set aside medical and created
something entirely new from scratch,
[SPEAKER_00]: reinventing it as they went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that with as big as the market's
going to be in California, that's one big
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage from day one that will be
helpful to entrepreneurs there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, honestly,
one of the reasons why after 20 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: the legislature finally did pass something
in California for medical is because they
[SPEAKER_01]: knew that adult use was on the horizon and
they understood because of what happened
[SPEAKER_01]: in states like Washington versus states
like Colorado, that it made sense to set
[SPEAKER_01]: out a structure for medical cannabis and
create that system alongside the adult use
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what will happen would happen would be
similar to Washington, which is to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical system just kind of get usurped
into the adult use system and see patients
[SPEAKER_01]: not have the same kind of access or the
same kind of price discount that they
[SPEAKER_01]: should have given their patient status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're talking about medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of concern before the
election that Proposition 64 would would
[SPEAKER_00]: harken the end of the medical market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there were no provisions
put in the proposition to exclude it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, there were provisions to
protect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But based on what we saw in Washington,
you know, what do you think the likelihood
[SPEAKER_00]: is that now that commercial adult use
cannabis is legal, that the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: lobbyists will will seek to squeeze out
medical?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, that's that's now a
competing market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't think it's going to be a
competing market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's more likely to happen in
the coming legislative session is a
[SPEAKER_01]: reconciliation of Prop 64 and MCRSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the same agencies governing the
two programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no differences in the types of
products that adult users can access
[SPEAKER_01]: versus medical users.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I think we're likely to see at the
end of the day is a consolidated system
[SPEAKER_01]: where patients get a financial break on
the cost of the medicine and those who are
[SPEAKER_01]: 18, 19 and 20 years old can access
cannabis with a doctor's recommendation
[SPEAKER_01]: and that the price break for those
individuals is subsidized by the taxes
[SPEAKER_01]: paid by adult users.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's more likely going to
be the model we'll end up seeing given
[SPEAKER_01]: that the regulations for medical and for
adult use are so similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it sounds like the integration of
how they are going to be regulated and
[SPEAKER_00]: since they're going to be regulated by the
same body will definitely decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: conflict at the regulatory side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't help but think that the
lobbyists in commercial will will do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that they can to squeeze
medical so that they can start selling to
[SPEAKER_00]: those patients as well and maybe with a
different tax rate, but to capture those
[SPEAKER_00]: folks anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that people, since they're
selling the same things, won't people
[SPEAKER_00]: still tend to want to use their medical
cards just to be able to get the better
[SPEAKER_00]: price in the medical market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's primarily going to be
what I call a Costco model where if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody that uses cannabis frequently,
whether that be for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes more sense for you to get a
medical card because you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: tax break every time you use it versus
somebody that uses cannabis maybe every
[SPEAKER_01]: once in a while and doesn't really make
sense for them to go and get a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: card and they'd rather just pay the tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that there'll be options for
people who based on how frequently they
[SPEAKER_01]: use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, is that even though we
haven't had state level regulations for 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years, we absolutely have an industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Chiba Choo, Kiva, Bang, I mean,
all of these companies have been in
[SPEAKER_01]: California dispensaries for years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not as if there's a whole new
flood or room for a whole new flood of
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial products in California at the
moment because we really do have quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of commercial cannabis providers
right now today in the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I do think that there will be
some diversification because there may be
[SPEAKER_01]: products that people in the adult use
market want more often, such as low dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing adult users more interested
in low dose products where patients are
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for higher dose products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will see some diversification,
but at the end of the day, patients will
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to the same products and the
same name brands that they have right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the point that California
already has a strong pre-existing market
[SPEAKER_00]: was made, oh, I guess it was three shows
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Dr. Dominic Corva on the show from
CASP and he made the point, he says,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everybody's talking about the
green rush and the new green rush in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, but really, you know,
California started a green rush in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1970s and it's just never stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when I go and give talks to
younger folks today who want to get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry or are interested in it,
I say, you know, you're not going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: master cultivator and you're probably not
going to have a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these jobs are taken and,
you know, our job with regulation is to
[SPEAKER_01]: allow people who have already been working
in this industry and entree into the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: market, it's not to pave the way for all
kinds of new companies to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we want folks who are
already operating to be able to come into
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where we need to focus
on first, because we do have so many
[SPEAKER_01]: operators already here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to talk more about the
specifics of the opportunities for
[SPEAKER_00]: potential new entrepreneurs, but let's go
ahead and take our first short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into something as
deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there is more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage loyalty in the customers you
already have, but you certainly don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time and you're not ready to hire
someone full-time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend Blunt Brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blunt Branding principles Kirsten Nelson
and Anthony Garcia are focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is pretty much the most important
part of marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and Anthony will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale, and keep them coming down back to
you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on three
projects now for various clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: on results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making me a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every friend I've referred them
to has come back to thank me, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: just does not happen every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grab a pen and paper because the
website address is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_00]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_00]: while using cutting edge technology in the
background that make all of this easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Amanda Ryman of Drug Policy
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Amanda, right before the break,
you said something that stuck out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that the way that things are set
up now, there's not really a lot of room
[SPEAKER_00]: being created for new companies,
that really the focus right now is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the pre-existing market that exists
in California moving into the licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break that out for a little bit
for me more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, a lot of people who are
listening to the show are thinking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, now that adult use is legal,
let's take our skills and move into
[SPEAKER_00]: California cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your suggestions seem to be that just
because the law has been passed doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily mean there's a ton of room for
new companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I first want to make the point that
under Prop 64, there is a California
[SPEAKER_01]: residency requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had to have been a resident of
California I believe back from 2015,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that residency requirement is until
2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out there somewhere else in
the United States and you live somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: else and you're thinking I'm going to move
to California and get a license,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we wanted to, again, ensure that
those that have already been living and
[SPEAKER_01]: working in the industry in California have
priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also priority to already
existing companies, meaning dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers that have already been
existing but in this kind of gray,
[SPEAKER_01]: locally regulated area also have first
priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't mean that there's not
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really about where the need
is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in California, the need is not for
people to grow cannabis or sell cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: or even make cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, the need is helping these
companies come into compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the need is for software and for
packaging and for sustainable agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: methods and things that are going to help
those that are working in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: make the leap from the gray market to a
very heavily regulated system here in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the opportunities there are
pretty much endless because you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a ton of businesses that have been
operating in a way that is not
[SPEAKER_01]: satisfactory to California regulatory
standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have seed to sale and
all of these things that go along with
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have to have companies
that can help those in existence comply
[SPEAKER_01]: and be legal, especially given the
scrutiny we'll likely face at the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's an interesting
aspect to point out there that that just
[SPEAKER_00]: because licenses may not be the way to go
doesn't mean that our listeners need to
[SPEAKER_00]: feel crestfallen, that they somehow can't
get into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you know, I tell my clients all
the time, you know, if you can come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with an idea that's not in, that does not
need a license, you'll have so much an
[SPEAKER_00]: easier time having your business because
your regulatory structure will be so much
[SPEAKER_00]: less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that when it comes to moving into any
new industry, but especially the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, that decreasing your risk as
much as possible is the name of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if folks are listening and they're
like, oh, wow, are you telling me that all
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers are already there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, that might be the case,
but that doesn't mean that there isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: tons of opportunity for ancillary business
models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that will help those in the
industry do things to be more compliant,
[SPEAKER_01]: to make things more seamless, you know,
introducing processes to streamline,
[SPEAKER_01]: to make it easier for people and every
level of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've had people doing the jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had really no infrastructure in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's going to be needed in
order to keep up and satisfy the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a little bit about
rulemaking because, you know, the
[SPEAKER_00]: proposition only goes so far itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, there are groups that
then have to jump in to regulate their
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the bigger pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we've found in the states that are
already legalizing, sometimes that
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary wave of rulemaking can get
awfully messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who is actually going to be
implementing propositions in 64 in
[SPEAKER_00]: California?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does that look like for folks who
are trying to understand the landscape?
[SPEAKER_01]: So both MCRSA and Prop 64 hand over the
regulatory structure and rulemaking to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bureau of Marijuana Regulation,
which is at the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a state agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it includes representatives from the
Department of Food and Ag, the Department
[SPEAKER_01]: of Public Health, the Board of
Equalization, the Department of Consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: Affairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also has an advisory board made up
of those folks, plus researchers from the
[SPEAKER_01]: public health field, people from the
cannabis industry itself, patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So people that have a vested interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Prop 64 and MCRSA really set out a
blueprint for what regulation will look
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's up to this Bureau and with
feedback from folks in the state and in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry to fill in the blanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the next year, not only is the Bureau
going to be doing their due diligence and
[SPEAKER_01]: reaching out to farmers and others to
figure out the best way to implement these
[SPEAKER_01]: practices, given what's already happening
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also going to have to figure out
how the licenses are going to work,
[SPEAKER_01]: how you apply for a license, to kind of
get all of those wheels in motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that will also happen at
the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the timeframe looking like?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody was excited after the
election two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that maybe even the harder work
has to happen of making this all real,
[SPEAKER_00]: how long are we looking before the first
licenses are going to be handed out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, these are going to be
estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the mandate from the initiative is
that January 2018, that the state has to
[SPEAKER_01]: start issuing licenses by January 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll take about a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we saw in Colorado and
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, what we saw in Oregon was
that the state allowed dispensaries to
[SPEAKER_01]: start serving adults before the licenses
officially came out for the adult use only
[SPEAKER_01]: stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we may see something similar here
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Given that we do have licensed
dispensaries across the state,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't necessarily be surprised if we
saw the Bureau getting close to that date,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not quite ready to launch
everything, see a compromise with,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, if you're a licensed dispensary,
you can now start serving people 21 and up
[SPEAKER_01]: who don't have a doctor's recommendation,
given that the products are the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in Oregon, that wasn't the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical patients had access to different
products than adult users.
[SPEAKER_01]: Namely, medical patients had access to
things besides flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in California, both groups have
access to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wouldn't be unheard of for someone
who's now serving patients with a doctor's
[SPEAKER_01]: note to open up that service to those 21
and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My gosh, that would be such a windfall for
all those retailers, my goodness,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're already up and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as part of the transition,
they might be able to sell to anyone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: over 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, you have to remember that
here in California, it's no trick to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor's recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for the most part,
a lot of the medical cannabis population
[SPEAKER_01]: here in California resembles the adult use
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different than in other states where
you have very restricted lists of
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions for which people can become
patients, the adult use market is quite
[SPEAKER_01]: different than the medical market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily the same here in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the next year, the new regulations
are going to come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to apply for these licenses will come
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the folks who don't want to see
this happen will be making their moves,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in other states, we have seen
challenges with moratoria by local
[SPEAKER_00]: municipalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it look like there will be zoning
issues in California like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, where, you know, this is passed at
the state level, but individual cities
[SPEAKER_00]: will pass a moratorium that says,
no, you can't do cannabis business here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw places passing that before Prop 64
even passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's no secret that California
is a bit divided on this issue and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have localities in the Bay Area and
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are very proactive that are really
wanting to study this issue and bring
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis to their localities in a
respectful way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have places that just hate
cannabis and they're going to ban it
[SPEAKER_01]: outright and they want nothing to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about Prop 64 is that it denies
local revenue to localities that ban
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I think a lot of these bans are
reactionary, what we'll see is that
[SPEAKER_01]: counties and cities whose neighbors are
regulating commercially, their residents
[SPEAKER_01]: are just going to drive 10 miles down the
road, buy cannabis, and then all the tax
[SPEAKER_01]: revenue is going to go to their
neighboring city.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we do see even a patchwork
of alcohol regulation here in California
[SPEAKER_01]: with counties regulating alcohol
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the decision to become a dry county or
a dry city definitely has economic
[SPEAKER_01]: implications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the one thing that localities cannot
do is they cannot ban personal cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: for adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ability for each household to
cultivate six plants indoors or outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: in an enclosed structure away from public
view, that right went into effect November
[SPEAKER_01]: 9th and localities are not allowed to ban
that activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the nature of the difference in
legality between a city hosting a business
[SPEAKER_00]: versus a city banning individual personal
grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between those
legally that one can be done away with at
[SPEAKER_00]: the local level and the other cannot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're really giving a city the
right to regulate commercial activity
[SPEAKER_01]: within its borders, not personal activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you legalize possession of cannabis,
the cultivation of cannabis as a legal
[SPEAKER_01]: personal activity, the city does not have
the right to ban that activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can tell you where you can do it,
which we already did in the proposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said you either have to do it indoors
or if you're trying to do it outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has to be away from public view to cut
down on the risk of robbery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a locality cannot make a decision to
not uphold the rights given to an
[SPEAKER_01]: individual under the proposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they can do is make the decision
about which commercial enterprises they
[SPEAKER_01]: want existing within their borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another vote for entrepreneurs
to start ancillary businesses as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you're not holding a license,
you're just an HR company or a marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: company or a software company with
cannabis clients versus having a license
[SPEAKER_00]: and having to be worrying about local
moratoria.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's definitely true in terms of
getting a business license and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: into the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, just as a cautionary tale,
we have had several reports recently of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are involved in ancillary
businesses related to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry like legal work that have been
denied home loans and other types of
[SPEAKER_01]: financial benefits because of the nature
of their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, just because you're not
selling cannabis or growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean there's not a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you're taking being involved with the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the reasons why it's so
important for anybody that wants to get
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in the industry to understand the
movement and to understand the activism
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes with being a part of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're not ready to be an
activist, I would caution you against
[SPEAKER_01]: getting involved in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's another good point that
you are making, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of folks are like, OK, the law is
passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The activism has been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just come on in and start my
business now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're playing it too simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis entrepreneurs have got
to be activists, both to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: protect their turf from moratoria,
to make sure that it doesn't get rolled
[SPEAKER_00]: back and and also to be active in the
state legislature so that as the
[SPEAKER_00]: rulemaking evolves, it evolves in ways
that don't exclude or challenge their own
[SPEAKER_00]: business model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say, you know, I've been so
impressed with the sun grown farmers and
[SPEAKER_01]: their willingness to engage with the
bureau during this rulemaking period,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's kind of one of the biggest
mysteries is like cannabis farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are the costs associated with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best way to tax it and regulate
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And without the cannabis farmers
themselves coming forward and being open
[SPEAKER_01]: and honest about what they're doing and
how it works best, we would definitely not
[SPEAKER_01]: be as far as we are in terms of
acknowledging the usefulness of sun grown
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really takes people willing to come
out and to be honest about their thoughts
[SPEAKER_01]: and feelings about the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to be aware and educated on
the issue before you can be an effective
[SPEAKER_01]: advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to take another short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses everywhere are constantly
striving to reach out to people through
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know, though, that trying to reach
a cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the shaping fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service or brand
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that really lets people know what
sets your company apart from others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain your service or product
and what sets it apart as desirable and
[SPEAKER_00]: help our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately and
[SPEAKER_00]: with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the podcast is young but growing
at an exceptionally fast rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you become an advertiser on the shaping
fire podcast now, you are going to pay a
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction of the cost we'll be asking for
in just a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet everyone listening both now and to
the back catalog of interviews later will
[SPEAKER_00]: hear about your company again and again
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_00]: listening audience we will have forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Loos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is Amanda Ryman of
Drug Policy Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Amanda, right before the break,
you were talking about how important it
[SPEAKER_00]: was for sun-grown cannabis growers to
participate and get their feedback and
[SPEAKER_00]: experience into the regulatory process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, a lot of people are
concerned that with the great increase of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growing across the country,
but specifically right now in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: that electricity consumption is going to
skyrocket because the demand for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to get so increased so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, California is one of those places
that cannabis just loves and a huge part
[SPEAKER_00]: of your industry is being grown outdoors
or in greenhouses by the sunshine and not
[SPEAKER_00]: from generated electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some estimates that people have
been discussing in California about what
[SPEAKER_00]: direction the industry might grow as far
as electricity usage versus doing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses and taking advantage of the
sun?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, cannabis traditionally has
been grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plant, you know, just like any
other plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why we saw cannabis cultivation
come inside was because of prohibition and
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that people had to hide what they
were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's a culture around that
still that we're going to see dissipate
[SPEAKER_01]: with time, but there are some barriers to
moving full into sun-grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, if cannabis was not as
stigmatized and as demonized as it is
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, all cannabis would be grown
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that we have states that
legalize, but you're not allowed to ship
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis between states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Massachusetts or Maine, they can't grow
cannabis outside all year round.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have very harsh winters, but they're
not allowed to import cannabis from
[SPEAKER_01]: California like they would import wine or
other commodities and agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: products that grow better in other parts
of the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't say, well, hey, we'll just grow
our strawberries indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, no, let's get strawberries from
other places where it's still warm in
[SPEAKER_01]: December.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the lack of interstate
commerce really puts some states in a bind
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of their cultivation because it's
going to be very difficult for them to do
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor, which means they're going to have
to rely more on the energy-consuming
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, when we're able to ship
cannabis between states, I see states like
[SPEAKER_01]: California and others that are naturally
made for cannabis cultivation outdoors to
[SPEAKER_01]: start to fill the need of the other states
so that they don't have to rely so heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: on indoor production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a risk assessment that a
lot of folks in legalizing states are
[SPEAKER_00]: missing when they are setting up their
indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily expecting that there'll be
eventually an interstate market because as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as you allow interstate traffic,
it will totally remake the face of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry yet again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you think about the wine
industry and especially the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to have Appalachians for
cannabis, folks in other states are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to want to get cannabis from certain
Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're really going to see a
difference once we start to do interstate
[SPEAKER_01]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really feel that at that point the
indoor market will really start to
[SPEAKER_01]: dwindle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we also have a whole generation
of people coming off of prohibition when
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody really knows what cannabis is
supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have our ideas from high times
about what buds are supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was working at Berkeley Patients
Group, I used to call that bag appeal
[SPEAKER_01]: because you would have sun-grown cannabis
that cost two-thirds the price and tested
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same level of THC, yet people would
still gravitate towards these indoor buds
[SPEAKER_01]: because they looked tighter, they looked
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people were associating that with
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going to change and people
are going to associate quality with things
[SPEAKER_01]: like being pesticide-free, being grown
outdoors, being grown organically,
[SPEAKER_01]: and being grown in a specific Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can already see that happening at a
brand strategy level with folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: using greenhouses, not calling it outdoor
because outdoors kind of got that
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation of a hidden grow somewhere
that's been done cheap and fast versus
[SPEAKER_00]: sun-grown or similar words, which suggests
that, okay, yeah, it's grown under the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun, but it doesn't mean that it's not
done without exceptionally high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: growing technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned pesticide and the other
legalizing states have had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges with that, going to market with
flowers that we eventually found out were
[SPEAKER_00]: rife with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the new regulatory structure in
California, is that pre-baked in that
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide testing will take place or is
the particulars for that still to be
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's baked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So testing for both potency and purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we just need to get more labs up
and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess that's also an assumption that
doesn't necessarily play for California
[SPEAKER_00]: because since you already have labs for
testing in the medical market,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of them will just be expanding more,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most of the reputable dispensaries
have been testing their product for
[SPEAKER_01]: several years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of the big commercial edible and
other product companies have their
[SPEAKER_01]: products tested as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, one thing that's really
interesting is that when you look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution of the cannabis industry in
California, and I started studying it back
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2002 when you would walk into a
dispensary and you would get a brownie,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was basically just wrapped in
cellophane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone made it at home and brought it in
and you had no idea how strong it was or
[SPEAKER_01]: what the ingredients were or if brownie A
was going to be a lot different than
[SPEAKER_01]: brownie B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, looking just 10,
15 years later, the sophistication and the
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging and the testing, nobody mandated
that companies did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all self-regulation by the
industry in response to patients wanting
[SPEAKER_01]: to know what was in their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that as much flack as the
cannabis industry gets for just caring
[SPEAKER_01]: about money and it's the big green rush,
the folks that started this industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: they really cared about their patients and
about what they were giving consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they didn't, we wouldn't see them
taking the steps to do packaging and
[SPEAKER_01]: labeling and testing before the state
absolutely mandated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's reasons why the cannabis
probiotic growing movement, Homeland,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the growers there early on for
medical, they were very, they had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: concern about what was going into their
patients because it was a labor of love
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great that that kind of a head
space is at the front of the new
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial market as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Amanda, you know, there's one
thing I want to ask you because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of folks that are
listening, they may be moving towards
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and a lot of them may be new to
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to bring their skill set
from another industry over into cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: either with a license or without.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those folks are going to run
into a situation like folks did in other
[SPEAKER_00]: states where they want to hire a
consultant to help them bridge from their
[SPEAKER_00]: present industry experience to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been so many horror stories
of consultants from other states and folks
[SPEAKER_00]: getting swindled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just like to give you an opportunity
to share some of your experience of what
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs might want to think about
when vetting their consultants to hope
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can choose one that's going to
really be to their benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody's a consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's been in the business forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's getting really crazy out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, doing due diligence is very
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because somebody seems like they have
their shit together does not mean they
[SPEAKER_01]: have their shit together because there's a
lot of money that you can pay people to
[SPEAKER_01]: make it look like you have your shit
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to really ask them,
you know, how long have you really been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you get your start?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what companies have you worked
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have somebody that's been doing
this for less than five years,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say don't do it because the
industry has changed a lot, but not having
[SPEAKER_01]: the knowledge of where it was 10 years ago
is really not going to play well for you
[SPEAKER_01]: as a new business person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, I would make sure that
whoever you hire has a working knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: of government, how policies are made,
how bills are passed in the legislature,
[SPEAKER_01]: has some kind of experience with lobbying
or knowledge about how policy works,
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is different than any other
industry in that the policies that are
[SPEAKER_01]: passed will absolutely impact your ability
to succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have someone that has a
lot of knowledge that's willing to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: Sacramento, you know, a few times a week
to really stay on top of the hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana bills that are going to come
down the pike this year, you're not doing
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself a service by hiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you have to have somebody
that's political, and you also have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have somebody that has a working knowledge
of where this movement has come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, recently we had this marijuana
business conference in Las Vegas,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a friend of mine was there
representing students for sensible drug
[SPEAKER_01]: policy, and she said that three people
asked her what the drug war was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say, if that's you,
and you're out there going, hmm,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the drug war?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go turn around, walk away from the
industry, because honestly, you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: us more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a great segue to my next
question was going to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis entrepreneurs have got to be
active learners, probably as much or more
[SPEAKER_00]: than just about any other industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also know that there's so much poor
information online when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, specifically for California,
I'm going to ask you a two part question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, where can clean information
about what's going on in the legislature
[SPEAKER_00]: and with the regulatory groups be found
online for California?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second, do you have any other
sources for information for entrepreneurs
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would recommend they go to
instead of just blindly Googling whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: their question is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, never blindly Google anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's I think is a good lesson for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the National Cannabis Industry
Association, which has a chapter in
[SPEAKER_01]: California, the California Cannabis
Industry Association, I would really
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend checking them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they have really stay on top of
things that are happening in Sacramento
[SPEAKER_01]: and at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a wide variety of companies that
they represent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have caucuses that are industry
specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: So caucuses for manufacturers versus
distributors versus cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I think that's a really
good way to stay on top of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the Bureau of Marijuana Regulation,
their website at the state level will have
[SPEAKER_01]: updates on bills that have been
introduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also have been doing these town
halls across the state for different
[SPEAKER_01]: sectors of the industry where they want to
hear feedback from people that want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: involved and kind of what their concerns
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would definitely recommend doing
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are some great incubators
and accelerators out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One in particular is Canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Canopy started in Boulder and they just
opened offices in Berkeley and also down
[SPEAKER_01]: in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are an accelerator specifically
for companies that do not touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the companies that we're talking about,
the ancillary services, the software,
[SPEAKER_01]: the streamlining, they're the ones that
would support those kinds of businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in California, you know,
I would check them out because they have
[SPEAKER_01]: classes and they have opportunities for
people to join their programs to help grow
[SPEAKER_01]: their businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Amanda, before we say
goodbye here, there's one thing I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to hit on that's actually happening there
in your locale there in Oakland that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think is interesting to point out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've read a couple of articles
about the ideas of reparations for at-risk
[SPEAKER_00]: minority communities that have been
unbalancely hit with the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it's the city of Oakland is
actually giving deference to licenses to
[SPEAKER_00]: folks that are from these minority groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obviously not explaining it very well,
but that's what I'd like you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you explain that policy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in California, we have a law at
the state level against affirmative
[SPEAKER_01]: action, meaning that we're not allowed to
do set asides for women in minority owned
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some localities like Oakland have tried
to figure out what is a proxy for that so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can make sure that those that have
been most impacted by the drug war have as
[SPEAKER_01]: many, if not more opportunities to get
involved in this new regulated industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than others do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in Oakland, the idea was put forth
to set aside half of the licenses for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis businesses for people that have
been negatively impacted by the drug war,
[SPEAKER_01]: either because they live in a part of the
city that is heavily policed for drugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they themselves have been incarcerated
in Oakland for a marijuana-related offense
[SPEAKER_01]: within the past, I think, 10 years or five
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the original plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a bit controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not because of its intention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are no people that think this is
a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people agree that and recognize
that there have been communities that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been more impacted by marijuana
prohibition than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there's been a bit of a political
fight over who exactly should be included
[SPEAKER_01]: in this equity program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the city council members has
really derailed the process with really
[SPEAKER_01]: quite crazy demands such as current
marijuana businesses have to give 25% of
[SPEAKER_01]: their revenue, including retroactively,
to the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just things that are really making it
difficult to move forward with this plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, we're looking at
alternatives, including opening up the
[SPEAKER_01]: number of police beats that people can
qualify for the plan, making it so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not just a marijuana incarceration in
Oakland, but anywhere in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right now, we're going back and
forth with the city about what exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: this plan will look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it's putting Oakland behind
our other neighboring cities in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: their licensing and regulations around
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is concerning because Oakland has
always been kind of on the forefront of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that they've kind of been
sitting on their laurels like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, well, Oakland's always out in front,
so we can take as much time as we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because no one else is going to do this
licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And surrounding cities have started
licensing what Oakland wants to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're seeing businesses,
unfortunately, start to leave the city of
[SPEAKER_01]: Oakland to seek licenses in other
localities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we definitely support the idea of
helping people that have been most
[SPEAKER_01]: impacted get into the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have to do it in a way that makes
sense and in a way that will maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: Oakland as a competitive city in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: industry for decades to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's a really interesting
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about competing goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you not only are you trying to
help these minority communities that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been impacted, but at the same time,
at a city level, you need to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect Oakland as a business entity and
make sure that these companies decide to
[SPEAKER_00]: set up shop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll be very interested to check
back in with you on that down the line as
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulatory structure around all of
this evolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's we're going to stop for
today.
