[SPEAKER_01]: Hey there friends it is Shango from
Shaving Fire and I'm here again with Dan
[SPEAKER_01]: Jimmy from Gnome Automatics and we're
gonna talk about one particular cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: that he brought to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually it's the very first plant that he
brought to market and the reason why we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna talk about Alf today, specifically
Alf number five, is because you know over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years as Dan's plants have become more
and more popular with auto flower or auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flower growers everywhere, more and more
people are interested in his original
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did his original genetics come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if they like his stuff now they're
interested in going back a few generations
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting some of his earlier stuff so
they too can work with those and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: his particular Alf number five seeds
haven't been available for some time and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know on the forums and Dan will tell
me people ask him for him at shows and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything so people still really want
that Alf number five and so I figured you
[SPEAKER_01]: know since I'm here anyway might as well
take a chance and ask him to share with us
[SPEAKER_01]: the lineage of the Alf number five his
very first drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dan tell us about Alf number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Alf number five and you know I think
we'll get this out of the way everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: asked this one question and I remember
coming over to one of the Vimy events and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's one of the times that I was
actually donating Alf number five so we
[SPEAKER_00]: could get it out there get it to patients
and you asked what Alf stood for and if it
[SPEAKER_00]: was related to the alien which it is not
and it actually has a backbone into why
[SPEAKER_00]: it's called Alf and the genetic line it
stands for Afghan little fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan little fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan little fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's way different than the alien Alf on
the TV show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah yeah and the reason it got that name
is because the Afghani part of it are
[SPEAKER_00]: different lineages of Afghan influenced
cannabis that have been put into it so Alf
[SPEAKER_00]: number one Alf number two and Alf number
three and Alf number four came from Spain
[SPEAKER_00]: is where I sourced the original Alf
genetics from a breeder named Masi and she
[SPEAKER_00]: did the work up to Alf number four which
are four different Afghani influenced
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that were introduced into an
auto so she had breeding stock that she
[SPEAKER_00]: had were auto flowers she would take one
Afghani influence one of them was mazar I
[SPEAKER_00]: may not be pronouncing that right
introduced that into her auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that made Alf number two and then
Alf number three I think was skunk number
[SPEAKER_00]: one I believe on the lineage that's a
little that was just a little hazy for me
[SPEAKER_00]: because it wasn't talked much about but
the banger that came out of that was Alf
[SPEAKER_00]: number four which was deep chunk
introduced into the previous Alf lineage
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's where the color started
happening and that's when the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: started getting larger and that's when I
acquired them because I fell in love with
[SPEAKER_00]: her patio she had these patios shots in
Spain and this is before AFM this is you
[SPEAKER_00]: know she's like I met her icy mag days
rollitup.org days you know like we were
[SPEAKER_00]: bouncing around forums because we would
either get hated on people made poke fun
[SPEAKER_00]: of us because we're messing with auto
flowers back years ago and people are like
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowers were disdained for years and
still are in a lot of circles in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: circles they are but the reputation is
starting the people are starting to come
[SPEAKER_00]: around to the reputation because of the
work that we're putting into them you know
[SPEAKER_00]: so I got I acquire Alf number four from
Spain from bossy she gave me she said play
[SPEAKER_00]: with it do whatever you want to do with it
breed with it that's why I'm sending it to
[SPEAKER_00]: you I want it to carry on I want this to
be around and there was a lot of there was
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of potential the actual folio
generation of my Alf number four I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely sure I'm most likely it was F9 or
higher because her patio shots like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about a minute ago were just these
multi pots of auto flowers and by multi
[SPEAKER_00]: pot what I mean is like several autos in
one pot are these black and purple hues
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was gorgeous to see and I wanted
that yeah and I knew the genetic potential
[SPEAKER_00]: was there to help me further on down the
road so I get out number four it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: make out number five to stick true to her
heritage I added Bubba Kush which is
[SPEAKER_00]: another indica slash you know style
broadleaf cultivar to it and that's when
[SPEAKER_00]: all the magic started happening from the
liftoff for my genetics that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's pure alpha number five anvil came
from that line and coal miners daughter
[SPEAKER_00]: came from that line as well and you're
talking a moment ago like people want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the back stock they want Alf number
five to breed with because I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized it I'll never feminize it to
keep it true to its breeding heritage and
[SPEAKER_00]: then anvil I get asked for constantly you
know which is a pedigree outside it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice event phenotype I mean anvil is
everybody wants it because they want that
[SPEAKER_00]: purple color everything that you cross to
anvil comes out purple it does and it also
[SPEAKER_00]: adds one other thing that people really
really like and that's size and figure
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah yeah and the structure is great yeah
anvil gets big fast I mean some of them do
[SPEAKER_00]: run 90 days or longer indoor but you got
to remember you're getting extra veg time
[SPEAKER_00]: with them the plants are getting bigger
you're getting a bigger harvest and then
[SPEAKER_00]: of course those bones are good to breed
into anything else too I don't offer her
[SPEAKER_00]: in regular seed anymore I get asked for
that in regular seed it is gonna come back
[SPEAKER_00]: so is Alf but anvil will come back
feminized as it has been locked into and
[SPEAKER_00]: then Alf will come back as regular soon
I'm not gonna give dates yet I got one
[SPEAKER_01]: project I gotta finish yeah we know how
seed products are projects are it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna get back to that one of these
days so then like like a decade later
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like oh I should try to pop those
seeds you know yeah exactly what for
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation purposes too like I don't
want to sit on I mean I do a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: job of preserving my seeds I've gotten
seeds that are ten years old to germinate
[SPEAKER_00]: most recently was another batch of Alf
number four which mossy called the dragon
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend of mine open him up he had
the room to do it we did video chat to
[SPEAKER_00]: help with selections like two three times
a week when flowers started kicking in and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a reproduction of those to keep
them alive so I'm gonna search back
[SPEAKER_00]: through the original dragons and I'm gonna
work on our number five it will be this
[SPEAKER_00]: winter I've got the room and space to do
it now where I can isolate called force
[SPEAKER_01]: you've told me a few different times just
kind of mentioning it the the impact that
[SPEAKER_01]: Alf had on your breeding program yeah can
you just describe like you know in
[SPEAKER_01]: principle the impact that it had on your
program yeah so like in principle it
[SPEAKER_00]: improved the program exponentially for me
gave me good breeding stock it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: going out and getting a good quarter horse
you know to breed with to work on a farm
[SPEAKER_00]: you need I wanted a good workhorse
somebody who was robust somebody who was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give me potential and have a
diverse past that I could potentially open
[SPEAKER_00]: anything up and when I started introducing
like the other like the Bubba Kush to it
[SPEAKER_00]: you know to make Alf number five that's
when it was kind of like the gene pool
[SPEAKER_00]: busted open and it gave me both mildew
resistant size it gave me new colors it
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me honestly gave me confidence to
move my seed lines forward is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: really did you know I remember you asked
me earlier is you know when did you drop
[SPEAKER_00]: it how long ago was that I want to say
around four four and a half years ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: I can correlate that because of a
conversation I had with a dear friend of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine Jordan shout out to Jordan he came to
visit me here and we went to a can of con
[SPEAKER_00]: together because we're finally in legal
states and we realized quickly the can of
[SPEAKER_00]: con was okay but it was a way to get a
bunch of free shit which was cool that was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much the way it was out here at
that time and he had a conversation with
[SPEAKER_00]: me in the hotel that night and he said
remember getting ready to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed game make sure your breeding stock is
on lock there's a lot of people out there
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to enter into this they're throwing
out Hermes they're throwing out garbage
[SPEAKER_00]: crop don't be that guy and that's that's
stuck with me forever and we're still
[SPEAKER_00]: great friends you know but it's good to
have a friend to tell you that because he
[SPEAKER_01]: values your reputation because he's known
you for so long so um so you saw the alf
[SPEAKER_01]: being grown by mossy and you fell in love
with it because of what it was doing on
[SPEAKER_01]: her porch and so then you brought it to
the states and you started working with it
[SPEAKER_01]: and added bubble kush and then eventually
bred other things to it to to really kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of make the the original backbone of your
of your of your collection yep what are
[SPEAKER_01]: you doing with lines from alf now you know
alf itself might be a couple generations
[SPEAKER_01]: back but what are you working on now that
is of that same lineage so alf produced
[SPEAKER_00]: coal miners daughter which was a
phenotypical isolation and found matching
[SPEAKER_00]: parents and I've worked it it's an f5 now
and it has been used to hybridize several
[SPEAKER_00]: things as a recent because it also holds
the color it's very good at hashing it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very good at molded mildew resistance and
bugs don't seem to bother too much which
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of nice like we've talked earlier
I unfortunately have to battle mites every
[SPEAKER_00]: year yeah thrips not so bad but my biggest
foe out here are the mites and it seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like they stay away from it yeah
you know and so coal miners daughter lives
[SPEAKER_00]: in 304 which is the pickleberry cross with
which you know pickleberry coal miners
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter coal miners daughter came from
alf so those picked up and then the osage
[SPEAKER_00]: we talked about earlier which is behind us
here is my bobby's widow with coal miners
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter in it bobby's widow is kind of
like coal miners daughter in a sense bobby
[SPEAKER_00]: was born by using alf number four and
dynathem's white widow is what made that a
[SPEAKER_00]: new initial bobby's widow cross the reason
the bobby was it's bobby's dragon was
[SPEAKER_00]: because of it was a phenotypical isolation
she had done and as you can kind of see
[SPEAKER_00]: here as we're talking you can hear the
mentorship coming out she did multipots I
[SPEAKER_00]: love to breed multipots you get a good
idea of what you're dealing with with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lion in the offspring she did phenotypical
isolations is what's what I have done when
[SPEAKER_00]: I took alf number five and I did pure alf
coal miners daughter and painful so her
[SPEAKER_00]: influences are kind of still there as I
progress forward with the alf number five
[SPEAKER_00]: and its variants um I haven't had the the
pleasure of coming across some mossy is
[SPEAKER_00]: she still in the game she's still very
active on on a flower dot net she is still
[SPEAKER_00]: around I talk to her every now and again
she's probably a little frustrated at me
[SPEAKER_00]: right now I've got to get some packs out
to some prize winners and I've been kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of swamped so I haven't got those out I
mean so I'm sure she's a little little
[SPEAKER_00]: upset with me on that one but they are
coming I promised everything's packed I
[SPEAKER_01]: just got to get them to the post office
yeah yeah I think that I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that just about every breeder
everywhere has to say yes yes the packs
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming out it's gonna be alright yeah
they're coming and it's just like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people may or may not know I have
a nine to five I'm a father we do coach
[SPEAKER_00]: sports I've got dogs I've got you know the
gnome automatic side and you know I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: house to take care of and a family and
everything so things can get crazy from
[SPEAKER_00]: time to time so it's nice to have a day
where we could just sit and chill and talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about this because it doesn't happen often
yeah no it doesn't happen it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: happen enough right luckily we just live a
faria away from each other so that helps
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you're you're my closest
cultivation buddy so alright so I guess in
[SPEAKER_01]: wrapping up I would want to thank you for
all the donations you've made of the ALF
[SPEAKER_01]: number five to Vimea the the Vashon Island
patient outward outreach group that that I
[SPEAKER_01]: started out on Vashon where I live you
know in the in the early days you would
[SPEAKER_01]: just bring packs and and it's interesting
because every now and then I'll come
[SPEAKER_01]: across one of those packs and they may or
may not have seeds but you know how
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes in somebody's like like garden
or greenhouse like an old pack from a
[SPEAKER_01]: prior year would be sitting there yeah and
I'll pick one I'm like holy shit you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got ALF and they're like oh I loved that
plant you know I need more Vimea meetings
[SPEAKER_01]: so I can get more of those seeds but like
two things that are funny about that one
[SPEAKER_01]: is that people don't realize that like the
ALF isn't for sale you know anymore right
[SPEAKER_01]: and then and then the second thing is is
that people don't know how close they were
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually getting more ALF because you
know right before we had to take the break
[SPEAKER_01]: during the whole COVID thing from having
meetings because you cannot bring like
[SPEAKER_01]: patients together in that kind of
environment you actually gifted Vimea a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred pack of ALF number fives and we're
figuring out what we want to do with that
[SPEAKER_01]: next but but you know you're always been
so generous with patients everywhere but
[SPEAKER_01]: especially on you know the neighbor
patients on Vashon where I live so thanks
[SPEAKER_01]: very much for for sharing that you and I
both really share the vibe of making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that seeds get good seeds get in the hands
of patients and and not that that they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to just grow like the extras
you know the freebies so thanks for that
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely dude you know and it's like you
said it's always been an important part of
[SPEAKER_00]: who I am with this thing like the whole
reason I started growing cannabis was
[SPEAKER_00]: because of somebody who was dying with
cancer you know it is why the whole reason
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into it and then I get introduced to
find that you have these meetings on the
[SPEAKER_00]: island and it was a very intimate setting
and you are bringing in resources of
[SPEAKER_00]: people and not only were they had safe
access they had access to quality stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: they also had access access to quality
information to go along with it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and that meant a lot to me so making sure
that these parents these patients have
[SPEAKER_00]: access uses it fit right in with the whole
purpose and why I do this sure I enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: having the business and stuff like that's
great it's awesome it's been it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: really damn fun but like the most
important part to me is the patients you
[SPEAKER_00]: know just getting it to them making sure
they have it and you know kind of paying
[SPEAKER_01]: it forward right on awesome man so so I
guess I'll end with some plugs for your
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff so so if you want to find out more
about Dan's work and gnome automatics you
[SPEAKER_01]: can go to the website at gnomeautomatics
.com and then you can go to the Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: which is gnome underscore automatics right
that's correct right on and then you know
[SPEAKER_01]: he's got packs out they're like just about
everywhere so go to your you know go to
[SPEAKER_01]: your favorite distributor and score them
there and Dan's work is actually really
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciated by big farms too who need all
the plants to be consistent because he
[SPEAKER_01]: works his lines to you know the number
five the number six then right you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the you know you'll get down to you know
eight or nine generations on some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: they're consistent and so if you're a
farmer and you're looking for you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand or four thousand of the same
thing by all means reach out to Dan too so
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway thanks for your interest in elf
number five you know I hope that you found
[SPEAKER_01]: this valuable and thanks and I appreciate
it thank you man thanks for letting me
[SPEAKER_01]: share a little bit about my past right on
