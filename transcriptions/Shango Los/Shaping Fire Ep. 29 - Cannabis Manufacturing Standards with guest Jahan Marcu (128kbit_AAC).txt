[SPEAKER_01]: Making cannabis products for yourself or
your arthritic grandmother is one thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but making cannabis products for the
public is a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only are you way more likely to get
sued if you make a mistake, but selling
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products commercially means that
you need to adhere to a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: These standards are generally manifested
in a hodgepodge way through state
[SPEAKER_01]: experimentation, product failures,
and everyone's fear of violating the coal
[SPEAKER_01]: memo.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of those methods will necessarily
derive scientifically accurate
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing standards for cannabis
products, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mess.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today my guest is Jehan Marku.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jehan Marku is Chief Scientific Officer
and Chief Auditor for Americans for Safe
[SPEAKER_01]: Access and the Patient-Focused
Certification Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also on the board of directors of the
International Association for Cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: as Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He received his Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: for significant contributions to the study
of the structure and function of the CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor and the role of the
endocannabinoid system in bone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before earning his Ph.D., Dr. Marku worked
at the California Pacific Medical Center
[SPEAKER_01]: Research Institute studying the
anti-cancer properties of compounds from
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: He serves on multiple government and trade
association committees and scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jehan's work has appeared in a wide range
of media, including Forbes, The Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: Post, and Vice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also an author of the American Herbal
Pharmacopeia Cannabis Monograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jehan Marku was the first recipient of the
Billy Martin Research Award from the
[SPEAKER_01]: International Cannabinoid Research
Society, and he is a court-qualified
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic cannabinoid and cannabis expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Jehan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in the early days of medical
cannabis in Colorado and Washington and
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon and California, there were pretty
much zero production standards and few
[SPEAKER_01]: best practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was being made in, you know,
kitchens and spare rooms in people's
[SPEAKER_01]: homes, and most of it was made with care.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, most of the products were not
potency tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even toured one production facility
that had a chicken as a pet indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the push for more full
legalization was because everyone wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to increase quality standards and make
products more uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do you see as the early
motivators for cannabis folks to
[SPEAKER_01]: standardize and improve quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a number of things that were
putting pressure on cannabis providers at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one was doctors' confidence in
the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and when we first saw California
and other states come online with their
[SPEAKER_00]: medical programs between 1996 and then
starting in 2002, when Americans for Safe
[SPEAKER_00]: Access first helped create the
distribution and access centers in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland, California, by passing those
early regulations, you're right,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no required testing and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it became quickly evident that
physicians, which there were only a
[SPEAKER_00]: handful at the time writing
recommendations, weren't really that
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with recommending a product
that they did of an unknown consistency or
[SPEAKER_00]: safety and an unclear about what education
their patients were receiving before
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, while physicians were
recommending this in a very small number
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, they were also concerned about
their own education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of approached it from that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing that happened was the
DEA's denial of a rescheduling hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: happened around the turn of the century,
one of the several at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we read that as a roadmap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people probably didn't read the full
few hundred page reports, but I've read
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what they said is there's
these seven factors, there's these eight
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that cannabis has to fulfill to be
rescheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was there are no standards
of production, distribution, safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't studies or, you know,
on a lot of the products that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: accessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an education or training and
things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, oh, well, why don't we address
those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, DEA, for telling us what we
need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Steph Scheer, the executive
director of ASA, engaged in this really
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing campaign more than 10 years ago to
bring in standards groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were years long conversation
with the American Herbal Pharmacopeia and
[SPEAKER_00]: the American Herbal Products Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we began working on the American
Herbal Pharmacopeia Cannabis Monograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, there were no standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we created this monograph with
people like Ethan Russo and Mahmood
[SPEAKER_00]: El-Sadiq.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rafael Mishulam was a reviewer of the
document as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many, many other people, I think about
30 people in total, reviewed the monograph
[SPEAKER_00]: that myself and several other people
drafted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that readily got adopted across the
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's so much catch 22 in
that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEA is all like, you know,
we don't want to take it off schedule one,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would allow people to use it for
research until that there are standards
[SPEAKER_01]: and the standards they'd have to come from
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're you're put in this position
where you need to start really small and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the great thing is, is that the
University of Mississippi has been
[SPEAKER_00]: producing cannabis for decades that people
with compromised immune systems have been
[SPEAKER_00]: using without ever having a recall of
their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are occasional adverse
events reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, say what you want about the
specifications of the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone's a big fan of there being
stems and seeds and pulverized material,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it still met standards for use in
vulnerable populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people to this day through the old
federal IND program are receiving 300
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-world cannabis cigarettes a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Irv Rosenfeld, who's one of
them, has never, you know, his doctor has
[SPEAKER_00]: not as yet to report, you know,
him getting lung infections or having any
[SPEAKER_00]: serious illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some sense, we know that the the
cultivation production can be
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what standardized really means is that
the variability is known and you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: range, a target you're trying to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know what your range or
your variability is in your product,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have product specifications,
how do you know that's your product?
[SPEAKER_00]: And simple things like that can really
make a huge difference in the confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: that physicians might have and patients
might have because you don't just have to
[SPEAKER_00]: win over the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're grasping at whatever is available
to treat their symptoms, to improve their
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their caregivers are often the ones
who are accessing those products,
[SPEAKER_00]: administering those products, and making
critical thinking decisions about whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not that product is safe and
appropriate for their loved ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by increasing confidence in these
products is by adhering to voluntary
[SPEAKER_00]: consensus standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, every industry has pretty much
created its own standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who are involved, the
stakeholders, the interested parties get
[SPEAKER_00]: together and create standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we did with the American
Herbal Products Association, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: really amazing organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our standards are also public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we mentioned the monograph,
which creates, if you want to call this a
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical medicine or herbal supplement or
something like that, follow these
[SPEAKER_00]: standards to meet these specifications,
meet these guidelines, and you're making a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that fits that definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, you also have the operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The operations need trained staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Americans for safe access,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure that you're ensuring that
for patients is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with the American Herbal Products
Association, we decided to form these
[SPEAKER_00]: committees with them for cultivation,
manufacturing, laboratory testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, and dispensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over eight years, with involvement of
over 100 cannabis companies, we created
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when these were published,
they were readily adopted by over 20
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time, we saw recall
plans, adverse events reporting,
[SPEAKER_00]: lab testing, and mandatory employee
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has also been, I think,
a game changer for a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk for a moment about the
people involved with making the standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, Americans for safe access was,
was driving this pursuit, but you were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about lots of different people
coming in from different parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry to create this voluntary
consensus standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when there are so many different
players with a wide variety of approaches
[SPEAKER_01]: and opinions, how does a nascent industry
like ours derive a set of standards that
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow incorporates the body of knowledge
of all the people involved?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you get together a bunch of
cannabis people and there's usually as
[SPEAKER_01]: many opinions as there are people in the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without going too much into the
methodology, how did you find that the
[SPEAKER_01]: group opinion somehow melded together to
come up with a singular best practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think first, I'd like to illustrate
it with what the herbal products and
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical medicine industry has done in
the US and how they have come together,
[SPEAKER_00]: because even within existing botanical
medicines and herbal supplements,
[SPEAKER_00]: not all those companies adhere to the same
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are less robust in the health and
safety practices they take than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was a recent expose,
for example, at a major shopping outlet,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Target or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other herbal supplements had very little
to no active ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the same thing with some of these
CBD products that people are selling on
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that they have 0.00% CBD in them
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that a lot of
independent groups have looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'd like to use as an example
of how the industry can get galvanized is
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes for survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the 1990s, when OPA really became a
prominent player, the standards holding
[SPEAKER_00]: group for the patient focus certification
program, Larry Kessler, the then head of
[SPEAKER_00]: the FDA, made an announcement without a
strategic plan for it that he was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make all vitamins illegal in supplements
that didn't have a letter or number in
[SPEAKER_00]: their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vitamin E would be okay, B12 would be
okay, but say goodbye to your ginkgo
[SPEAKER_00]: biloba extract or potentially essential
oils, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can imagine, this galvanized an
industry in a way that had never been seen
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the FDA, through a decades long
process of gaining power, made a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: power play here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what ended up happening was that the
herbal products manufacturers and industry
[SPEAKER_00]: launched the most successful grassroots
campaign in the history of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: All health food stores across the country
and stores that sold herbal supplements,
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamins, botanical medicines,
put caution tape and tarps and things over
[SPEAKER_00]: the supplements, those sections and said,
if you want to have, this is what the FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to do is take away your ability to
choose your medicines, to choose your
[SPEAKER_00]: herbal supplements and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in between 1993 to 1990, 1994,
Congress received more letters about the
[SPEAKER_00]: right to choose your own botanical
medicines and herbal supplements than any
[SPEAKER_00]: other issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peace, the federal deficit,
war, you name it, that was the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the FDA called APA and said,
we give up, let's write a bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wrote the Dietary Health and
Supplement Education Act or DSHEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this created standards for labeling of
herbal products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shortly thereafter, there was also the
good manufacturing practices laws that
[SPEAKER_00]: passed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gave the industry a group of
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still to this day, there are many
great players in the botanical medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: and herbal product space, but there's also
a lot of characters who decide not to
[SPEAKER_00]: engage in that or create their own
standards group or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is it gives a path forward
for those people who are thinking ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that for the cannabis world,
it was, well, there are no standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: My regulations in my state haven't caught
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I immediately, a lot of companies see
the validity and value of taking on
[SPEAKER_00]: national standards or voluntary standards,
even if they're not required in their
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an example, medical cannabis
is not required to be tested in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are many companies that engage
in product safety tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not required to be testing for
their patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it becomes a market differentiator.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're able to use it in marketing to
say, hey, we adhere to a higher level of
[SPEAKER_01]: quality assurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and those are the places I think
that will stay open.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my mentors said to me, you're like
the world's luckiest paleontologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, well, you get to walk with
the dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 10, 20 years, no one's going to believe
you that there were these huge,
[SPEAKER_00]: big lumbering companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much like the dinosaurs, the
environment was very different then than
[SPEAKER_00]: it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think when we think about changes
in regulations, what is going to survive
[SPEAKER_00]: these changes in development of
regulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on the East Coast, what I'm seeing
with my work changes gears a little bit is
[SPEAKER_00]: with doing regulatory inspection trainings
and writing checklists for regulators and
[SPEAKER_00]: working with our contracts we have with
the program administrators, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting very serious about compliance,
not just with the cannabis regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but worker safety issues too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing cannabis operations
around the country now getting inspected,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they're federally illegal,
getting expected by state agencies and
[SPEAKER_00]: even the state agencies having nothing to
do with cannabis are issuing fines,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for worker safety violations
and dangerous environments, which could
[SPEAKER_00]: simply be that you don't have a fire
evacuation map on the wall and little
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that that you would expect
from any other employer you went to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are a lot of good players out
there and we cannot sit around and
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight and point out the bad guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think what we can do with standards
and third party certification is easily
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight the people who are doing things
right, who are doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the power of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, it differentiates people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the key to acceptance of
cannabis and getting over these walls that
[SPEAKER_00]: keep popping up is the standardization of
products, is applying these standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: is appropriately testing your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sometimes think that someday there's
going to be a cultivator or a manufacturer
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to get really upset when
someone brings them an influx of regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: THC reading from a lab and they're paying
for thousands of dollars of milligrams of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC that simply aren't there in the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that as things move forward
and get more regulated, the accuracy of
[SPEAKER_00]: lab testing, the reliability of labs,
the reliability of sample collection,
[SPEAKER_00]: representative sampling of products,
of standardization of processes is not
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to become an issue of quality,
but it will be a very serious economic
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already seeing that in extraction
vessels, which again, I've seen a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: groups that can't predict their yields
from doing an extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just say, oh, I got a lot this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as far as I know, a lot isn't really
a quantifiable number.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot compared to what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think people are always
surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I've done in my
own independent research field is I look
[SPEAKER_00]: at a lot of cannabis waste and there's so
much valuable stuff that simply isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted fully, that is thrown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes regulations do interfere
with some of these processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'd like to see more people looking
at cannabis roots, but some states make
[SPEAKER_00]: you throw that away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot of opportunities
in innovation and increasing efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: and overall product safety as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a lot of this hinges on a
couple of things is access to those
[SPEAKER_00]: educational materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, American State of Access helped design
a study on dispensary staff training,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was published in 2016 in December by
Ryan Vandrie and Marcel Von Miller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they showed was that a lot of
dispensary staff don't have science or
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine incorporated into their training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me illustrate something for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: To set the stage, the thing that I worry
about is imagine if, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had aggressive cancer and I was new to
cannabis and I went into a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have just three things to guide
my choice about a medicine for my
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a strain or variety name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is a potency level,
how much THC or CBD is in the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third thing is something that
says, keep out of reach of children or do
[SPEAKER_00]: not consume while driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really all the information that you
might have when making a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the quality of training of the
dispensary staff were the ambassadors of
[SPEAKER_00]: these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not producing the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not cultivating the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the dispensary staff has probably
never been inside a manufacturing facility
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it becomes really important that
they understand from seed to production
[SPEAKER_00]: what is important in these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that most, something like 30
to 40% had no science and medical
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had them over a phone interview make
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, okay, you have a patient coming in
with high anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you recommend in this instance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that you're not supposed to make
recommendations strictly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta be careful about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was, again, a survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of testing their knowledge about
the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some interesting findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one was that we had the statements
anonymous from the dispensary agents
[SPEAKER_00]: reviewed by physicians, by a panel of
physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about half the recommendations the
physicians thought would have exacerbated
[SPEAKER_00]: a patient's symptoms instead of improved
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was concerning.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, someone comes in with saying
they have appetite wasting or anorexia or
[SPEAKER_00]: HIV-AIDS and they need to improve their
appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone recommends a CBD-rich product,
which does not stimulate cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will not make you hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that would not have improved
someone's symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD can also be alerting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if someone's looking for something
that's gonna help them sleep better,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's debatable whether or not something
rich in cannabidiol alone would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: best choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you some conceptual examples
to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I actually run into that all the
time with patients who are taking CBD for
[SPEAKER_01]: pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wanna take it at night for the
pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it causes them to feel a little
stimulated and have a hard time going to
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we move their CBD to the front part
of the day and give them something with
[SPEAKER_01]: light THC from, dare I call it,
Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, strain and helps them with their
insomnia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, we're a little late for our first
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and take our short
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also very funny to listen to the
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you're at your place there in
Brooklyn and you can really get a sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like kids outside playing
hopscotch or whatever they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I live in Crown Heights and there's
actually a rabbi down the road from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a big family, but he's also one of
the medical cannabis recommending
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and take that short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Jehan Markhu, Chief Science
[SPEAKER_01]: Officer at Americans for Safe Access.
[SPEAKER_01]: We humans are attracted to plants because
they offer us relief and are a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes though, the best parts are
buried inside the plant and we need to use
[SPEAKER_01]: specialty extraction technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to cannabis, it is
extraordinarily important to extract its
[SPEAKER_01]: precious oils without changing them in the
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to preserve the properties of the
cannabinoids, terpenes, and other
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents that all work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1994, Eden Labs has been developing
extraction technology and processes to do
[SPEAKER_01]: just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs was founded by a cannabis-loving
engineer during the early days of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana in California and the expanded
Eden team has been designing and building
[SPEAKER_01]: industry-leading solutions for cannabis
extraction ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs' flagship product is the newly
improved high flow CO2 extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: As other extraction companies enter the
market, it is the high flow from Eden Labs
[SPEAKER_01]: that everyone chases and tries to compare
themselves with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but the improved automation
software allows data to be collected,
[SPEAKER_01]: stored, and studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs can outfit your whole lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden's cold finger ethanol extractor
creates astonishing whole plant extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: working alone or in tandem with an initial
stream distilling step to isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: monoterpenes before extracting the rest of
the botanical constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden offers you many options including
vacuum distillation, column distilling,
[SPEAKER_01]: stirred reactor units, and accelerated
solvent recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you partner with Eden Labs,
your lab team is enrolled into the Eden
[SPEAKER_01]: Labs training program to boost their
understanding of Eden's best practices to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that your outputs are exactly what
you require for your application,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be DAB oil, oil for pen
cartridges, or edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you work with Eden, you're not just
buying the tech, you are buying dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: customer support to help you attain your
business goals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear Eden's CEO, A.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Braddock, talk about the company's values
during Shaping Fire episode 19 that was
[SPEAKER_01]: all about CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the new companies in the market
just smell opportunity, slap an extractor
[SPEAKER_01]: together, and hire a marketing company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs has been listening to feedback
from extractors and consumers for about 25
[SPEAKER_01]: years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about both you and your
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partner with Eden Labs to extract
astonishing cannabis oils and terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: that you will be proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash Eden
to find out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know that Shaping Fire has a
fabulous YouTube channel?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I attend conventions to speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_01]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Kevin
[SPEAKER_01]: Jodry of Wonderland Nursery talking about
breeding cannabis for the best terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile, Dr. Sunil Agrawal on the history
of cannabis medicine around the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: Tad Hussey of Keep It Simple Organics on
living soil, microbes, and mycelium,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Ben Cassidy of True Terpenes on using
terpenes for health in your everyday life,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Reggie Gaudino of Steep Hill on the
cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes, the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system, and holistic
orcharding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even my own presentations on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: As of today, there are over 50 videos you
can check out for free.

[SPEAKER_01]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Jehan Marku, Chief Science
[SPEAKER_01]: Officer at Americans for Safe Access.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked during the first set about
some of the best practices that have
[SPEAKER_01]: started to become industry standards and
where those standards are even coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I think a lot about
is the contrast between processing enough
[SPEAKER_01]: for uniformity of the product so it meets
a standard versus the importance of whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by whole plant medicine, of course,
I mean preserving all the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents as a whole group in the final
product so the patient can take advantage
[SPEAKER_01]: of the entourage effect for both human
healing and equality buzz, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more we process, the more we seem to
break up the plant into its discrete
[SPEAKER_01]: parts, thus moving away from whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure that you've had to give it
this a lot of thought in developing these
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do you kind of think through this
for yourself to find a happy medium
[SPEAKER_01]: between repeatable results of a product
but also being whole plant since that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where all of the really good cannabis
studies are based on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, well, so I've been injecting
cannabis into various instruments and
[SPEAKER_00]: applying it to cells for a fair amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I quickly realized this issue just
within my own hands because I was having
[SPEAKER_00]: to generate data and just a simple student
level and present it to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was working with an internship with
Arno Hazekop, which seems like a lifetime
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, where I had to ride a bicycle and
pick up samples from a coffee shop as part
[SPEAKER_00]: of a product safety study and analyze
those in the lab at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Leiden in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I quickly found out that, wow,
ethanol versus other solvents like ether
[SPEAKER_00]: or sodium hydroxide really could change
what you were looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use solvents in a setup where
you could actually remove the acids from
[SPEAKER_00]: the extraction or you could favor the
extraction of some other terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something we're seeing now,
I think, is affecting testing is people
[SPEAKER_00]: are like, oh, the labs are getting it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, sometimes it's the user
error there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also when we do a targeted analysis,
like saying, we just want to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and you extract for those,
nothing comes out entirely unscathed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have an efficiency there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some research that we've done over in
the Czech Republic comparing different,
[SPEAKER_00]: very recently comparing different solvents
and extraction processes, we found like,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy cow, like, oh, wow, if you use
methanol over ethanol, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: favor certain terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I think people need to start
thinking about is what they're testing
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have a targeted approach,
which is like, I want to test for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can have non-targeted,
which is, I just want to see everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's there before I begin the targeted
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about losing compounds
and changing things, it's absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could start with one set of powdered
flour, like a standardized batch of flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say, imagine a 50-gallon drum of
powdered cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone takes a handful out for a
different extraction process to make,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, an oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could end up with as many oils as
samples you took with different
[SPEAKER_00]: specifications because someone uses a
different ratio of methanol and ether or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is that they're extracting in,
methanol chloroform, what have you,
[SPEAKER_00]: versus ethanol or CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you could end up with different
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you think about the lab,
well, what are they using?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they using to prepare their
sample for analysis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the lab just doesn't take a cookie
and like, oh, this looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to shove this into my $250,000
piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to destroy a workhorse
in your lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just clog it and shut down the system,
call it a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to extract what they want to
test out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that as we think about
manufacturing, we shouldn't think so much
[SPEAKER_00]: about focusing on accuracy is important,
but also, what are you making?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your specifications?
[SPEAKER_00]: People are very efficiently using CO2,
which I think can be one of the safest
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction methods, but oftentimes,
if you're not super savvy and have 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years of experience, buy bi-terpenes and
you have to kind of collect those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you add them back to the product,
are you adding them back in the same ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my very first research poster was
entitled Plant Wisdom, Cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_00]: Enhances the Anti-Cancer Effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first thing I ever presented at
a research conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I developed that idea, of course,
from talking with amazing people,
[SPEAKER_00]: reading other people's work, but doing my
own analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had at the time gotten the
permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think enough time has passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at San Francisco State University,
I got this very special permission to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: very short-term project studying cannabis
through the legal market that had
[SPEAKER_00]: developed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a patient at the time, which made
things less complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, I got permission for this
one-year project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found in my own very small
sampling was when I used different
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction methods, I did see slightly
different ratios of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I used the same extraction method
against different samples, I saw there
[SPEAKER_00]: were varying ratios of terpenes and
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I didn't quantify everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just doing a non-targeted approach,
saying, well, what does the fingerprint
[SPEAKER_00]: look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we repeatedly make these
fingerprints?
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a while, I was like,
wow, there is a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even 10, 15 years ago,
you could find amounts of CBD that were 1%
[SPEAKER_00]: to 5% in the cannabis material being
distributed in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one was looking for it at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I brought that data to a lab where
I was working and said, hey, I have this
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography data that looks at ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's something here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of these ratios might be good
for treating a certain disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, well, we have these really
aggressive brain cancer cells and petri
[SPEAKER_00]: dishes that don't seem to have anything
that affects them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we throw some cannabinoids in
there and see what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so rather than start with the data
that we had from analyzing samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: we started with math.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started with, well, let's just add
THC in an increasing amount, see what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's add CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's add CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's add CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took amounts of those
compounds that really did nothing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cells and started combining them
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through mathematics and what's called
a bunch of other nerdy statistical stuff I
[SPEAKER_00]: won't go into, the paper has already been
published, so if you want to look that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found basically that you could
enhance activity with combinations of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that came out of
that was a four-to-one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC to CBD in a petri dish to inhibit
brain cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you say we wanted to turn that
into a product saying, wow, that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like something that can affect a very
particular type of brain cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very particular molecular pathways could
be triggered, that might inform what type
[SPEAKER_00]: of product you want from your
specification.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the other cannabinoids are not
important and the other terpenoids are not
[SPEAKER_00]: important, then you're going to extract
and process for those purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think my roundabout way of
talking about that is there can be what's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant and there can be what you
determine scientifically might be needed
[SPEAKER_00]: for a condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two things are not diametrically
opposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through proper extraction, through knowing
what you want to get in the end product,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can then choose an appropriate
extraction method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I feel like it's a little bit of
a ready, fire, aim approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put everything into the extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this, it's some sort of magical
filter that separates things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think when we think about
manufacturing, people should have an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind about what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think JW Pharmaceuticals is sort of
the great conceptual example, is they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted a one-to-one ratio of THC to CBD in
their product, as well as a high level of
[SPEAKER_00]: certain terpenes that have strong
anti-anxiety properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they took their CBD rich material,
made a hash oil extract, took their THC
[SPEAKER_00]: rich material, made a hash oil extract,
and then combined those in ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sort of thinking I think needs to
start creeping over into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients are taking different strains and
combining them to explore their effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would encourage more operators to be
more open about what they're making and
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're combining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just take all the refuse and throw
it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep track of where that extra material is
coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are two different strains and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's interesting that,
excuse me, that you kind of approach the
[SPEAKER_01]: question from the opposite direction than
I normally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the whole plant evangelists
that I talk with where we generally look
[SPEAKER_01]: at it as that, okay, your best would be
either smoking or eating the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's perfect, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a step down from that would be an
ethanol soak, which gets a good amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you go down through the
hydrocarbons and CO2, you're getting less
[SPEAKER_01]: and less of the whole plant-ness of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like your idea that, too,
instead of continually going back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant or the flower as being the goal and
to have all the extraction methods and
[SPEAKER_01]: processing methods have to compare
themselves to the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, go the other direction and say,
okay, what's the end goal of the product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this an intense dab oil for an extreme
pain patient?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this somebody who needs to get just a
little bit of THC but a whole lot of THCA
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're working with Lyme's
disease or rheumatoid arthritis or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that approach is actually
far more forgiving for designers than the
[SPEAKER_01]: way most of us go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that opens up some new
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me take this one more step further
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some product designers break the
cannabis plant into all of its individual
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents and then re-blend them as
they wish, customly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other folks use isolates of components
and just sell them as is, like the
[SPEAKER_01]: popularity of CBD isolate right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some use the full extract cannabis
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be variability in the
components from run to run, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be true to the strain behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question for you is, do you think
that there's a place for that variability
[SPEAKER_01]: that's necessary when using whole plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because let's say that I run 10 plants of
the same strain and I make ethanol hash
[SPEAKER_01]: oil out of it and they're all in syringes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be some drift between
syringe, but they really are the pure
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you resolve that for yourself when
doing standards between staying true to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant versus having repeatable results
so that labeling on the package is
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, we have two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, companies have already created
standardized products with whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bedger Can International, fantastic
example of what you can do with
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized cultivation procedures and
creating standardized plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make cannabis plant material
that will meet pharmaceutical standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some eyebrow raising things that
they do like gamma irradiate the material
[SPEAKER_00]: which some people don't have a problem
with, some people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The banana I ate this morning was probably
gamma irradiated from the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ability to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut is a state I like to use too
because they have to meet pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about this drift,
it's absolutely possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this drift that we talk about,
it happens with all natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't like to often invoke talking
about the alcohol industry, but it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: illuminating and informative when we talk
about hops is most closely related
[SPEAKER_00]: relative, the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So breweries deal with this similar issues
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a thing called heads, hearts,
and tails when you make a huge batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the differences between some
types of beer and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to graduate school in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very rich and vibrant beer
community there of these various breweries
[SPEAKER_00]: that people travel from all over to visit
and they deal with the same issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've done it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've put science in there saying,
when some stuff is coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: vessel and we're bottling it, we're paying
attention to those different things
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's certain parts of it you
don't want where the sediment has settled
[SPEAKER_00]: or near the top where it might be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it needs to be continuously mixed
while you're allotting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are lots of other products
that are natural that we see around us
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate to use company names,
but one of my favorite things to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: people is why is Budweiser the king of
beers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it because it's delicious and
refreshing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really because it's the same
anywhere you open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open it in Japan or Paris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in Tennessee, it's going to be the same
product within a certain level of
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think thinking about it in broader
terms, yeah, if you are capsulating or
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging a batch, there might be certain
things you can do to reduce the standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's also why you keep track of
batches and also know what part you might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen extracts that have been sitting
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In storage, I used to work under a D.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: license in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did some really just super fun stuff
collaborating with Mapu and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Sipi used to characterize
new cannabinoids you would discover and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And visiting Ole Miss, you can see that
even extracts that were homogenized after
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been sitting for a while,
they will start to separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will see this sort of head,
hearts and tails sort of thing happen or
[SPEAKER_00]: even a by basic thing where some of the,
you know, fats and stuff go to the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: even just sitting on a shelf over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the drift, you know,
with some of the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's more serious than others,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's if there's a drift in CBG,
unless that's the part of the medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: that you need, you know, the CBG may or
may not matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with THC, obviously, it becomes
serious really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the most serious challenges
that edibles makers have is to ensure that
[SPEAKER_01]: each piece has the same dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, eating the first of 10
cookies in a package, expecting it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 milligrams when it's actually 17
milligrams can be a big deal to many
[SPEAKER_01]: users.
[SPEAKER_01]: So homogenization is a real problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what best practices do you see
the industry adopting so each edible of a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular package is reliably dosed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that comes down to developing
a method for properly extracting the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids from your edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that has always struck me as
weird is that, you know, I visit a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis labs and almost no manufacturer
provides a blank of their product for the
[SPEAKER_00]: labs to calibrate to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they might provide them the soda or
the cookie or the lozenge, but they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: provide them just that matrix like,
oh, here is what we use so you can create
[SPEAKER_00]: a sample prep method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's part of it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was an issue when we were doing
at a small team and we were traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: between different labs with our equipment
to look at edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we published and threw out into
the Internet was, hey, if you freeze these
[SPEAKER_00]: products and pulverize them, you can
create a powder of almost anything and
[SPEAKER_00]: then do a more efficient extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, you know, we ran into the issue
where companies could not supply a blank
[SPEAKER_00]: of their product so that we could spike it
with cannabinoids and make sure that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were validating that collection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that there is one that's aspect
of it, which says that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every every single cannabis
manufacturer needs an in-house lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't label your own supply,
but it can be extremely helpful to check
[SPEAKER_00]: along the production line if you're doing
things correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you go from step A to step B to step
C to step D, you're taking measurements of
[SPEAKER_00]: one type or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're organoleptic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a smell and feel thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a decarboxylation step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the final testing,
you send it out to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what's now, you know, versus the
old reactionary method, which is we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make something and get a pass
fail at the end, which leads to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of questions about standardization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, thin layer
chromatography using the silica plates and
[SPEAKER_00]: other devices can provide a wealth of
information to help guide you in that
[SPEAKER_00]: production process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think for your if you're trying
to develop a better brownie or lozenge or
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery of any product, you're going to
need the in-house lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just isn't going to be feasible usually
unless you have a very good relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're nearby working with a lab to
get those instantaneous results that can
[SPEAKER_00]: feed R&D and give you sort of real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make adjustments in the process
to make sure you're getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also have to determine what makes
a batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what you see, you know,
people always talk about the oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dog food industry uses like 50 pounds
of dog food per batch to do their sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: for quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you tell, you know, oh, yeah,
we're going to do 50 pounds of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, no way that like is like
the price per gold per ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way we're giving you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way too expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not you know, those numbers are
conflated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, what needs to be understood
is that when you first start a product,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount that you have to sacrifice for
quality control to establish those limits
[SPEAKER_00]: is vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's large.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big wide sampling area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you say, OK, look, these products
are being consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: These products have these specifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start to narrow that testing
window and make it tighter and tighter and
[SPEAKER_00]: tighter until there's issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to kind of expand it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of like our universe,
which expands and contracts as should the
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling window to ensure that your
product safety and consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think, you know, if you're,
say, making edible products, you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrificing a batch or two for lab to make
sure you have a validated method for that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take our second short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.

[SPEAKER_01]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time to really dig into something as
deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there is more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and to
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage loyalty in the customers you
already have, but you certainly don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time and you're not ready to hire
someone full-time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you, I recommend blunt branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blunt branding principles, Kirsten Nelson
and Anthony Garcia are focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging and website
[SPEAKER_01]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that is pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: the most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and Anthony will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_01]: of sale and keep them coming back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with blunt branding on three
projects now for various clients and every
[SPEAKER_01]: single time they have done more than they
have promised and over-delivered on
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: making me a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, every friend I've referred them
to has come back to thank me and that just
[SPEAKER_01]: does not happen every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grab a pen and paper because the
website address is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_01]: give blunt branding a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_01]: while using cutting edge technology in the
background that make all of this easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: automatic and trackable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash blunt
branding to find out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also click the link in our weekly
newsletter, blunt branding, marketing that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes you money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess this week is Jehan Marku,
chief science officer at Americans for
[SPEAKER_01]: Safe Access.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the obvious end game for all
of these standards outside of just simple
[SPEAKER_01]: patient and consumer safety is that
eventually the United States will be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to participate in the brand new
international trade of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's already starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the United States is quickly falling
behind because we're still schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that you work with
international groups to help develop these
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm curious, you know, at this
point from the countries that are just now
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to trade, like, you know,
cannabis exporting and such, who is
[SPEAKER_01]: setting the international standards for
cannabis now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an international governing body
that people are referring to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it simply country A and country B,
they're adopting their own standards and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trading based on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Largely who determines the standards and
international regulations are the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who show up to those meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of standards are done through a
voluntary consensus process, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: that volunteers, people are giving their
time to international standards groups to
[SPEAKER_00]: work on these committees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, I am a chairman of the D
37 cannabis subcommittee under training,
[SPEAKER_00]: credentialing and assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the standards I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, they really they really gave it a
sexy title, didn't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost fits on a business card.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were working on an acronym.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, they have a dozen other
subcommittees are addressing everything
[SPEAKER_00]: from security to cultivation standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there it's all run by volunteers at
ASTM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there that's the international
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to get to the international
level, the individual players like the
[SPEAKER_00]: country A country B has to develop
monographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the US has a monograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've reintroduced cannabis into the
pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland has a monograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany has a monograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple other countries do,
which has led Europe to say, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, these countries have standards for
their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can start to come together and
harmonize those across jurisdictional
[SPEAKER_00]: boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we really want to avoid is,
you know, politicians who have no may have
[SPEAKER_00]: no experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, there are there's like two
politicians in our entire country that
[SPEAKER_00]: have a science background.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, most do not have experience
with medicine or product safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's they're just kind of doing what
sounds good often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we end up with these really
incongruent standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where international standards come in
is if a group like ASTM, which if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't aren't familiar, I'd consider a
quick Internet search.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save us some time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their international standards body
create tons of standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've submitted our best practices that
we've worked on to help guide this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as ASTM posts something,
countries that don't have any regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: established, which is pretty much a lot of
them, will adopt that immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will probably supplant what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we talk about walking with
dinosaurs, if you're not paying attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to what's happening with the voluntary
consensus standards process, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be hitting a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of time and developing
your own standards at the local level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whether or not that will be even
considered by international standards
[SPEAKER_00]: group that all governments look to for
guiding their industry is dependent on you
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing those standards and showing up
to the meeting where people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this for like 100 years,
developing standards for products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think, you know, I used to say,
I think erroneously or maybe misspeaking
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, you know, I was encouraging people
like actually stop creating new cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so many resources here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I feel more like, OK, maybe it's a
good thing that we see all these sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: independent groups that aren't talking to
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they should be bringing their
standards up for peer review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one dangerous trend for me that I see
is groups that sell standards to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standards are not some secret thing that
should be behind paywalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: These should be accessible to everyone so
that everyone can understand product
[SPEAKER_00]: safety so they can effectively protect
public health in these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that participation is
essential right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking if even if your only option is
locally, but put pressure on your
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives of that local industry
association to participate in ASTM,
[SPEAKER_00]: to participate in OPPO or these other
groups that are working nationally and
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go, when you attend these
international meetings where the where the
[SPEAKER_01]: standards are being discussed and brought
to fruition, are there U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: government representatives there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: has attended it.
And I think this is a good opportunity for
you to get involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an opportunity to just poo
poo anything that we were not involved
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can imagine a world where,
you know, we're all we're all still
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule one and over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and this this international body is
making these standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: government isn't involved when we finally
get around to de-scheduling, suddenly
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll be like, oh, well, we weren't
involved with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to have to start all over
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my question for you is,
is the US government involved in some ways
[SPEAKER_01]: so that when we eventually do schedule,
we can slide right in?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second part of that question is,
what do you think that we would need to do
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring our industry in line with those
standards so that we could start
[SPEAKER_01]: participating in international trade?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that government
representatives will always have an
[SPEAKER_00]: arms-length approach to something like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not to mean that people who don't
have experience or are showing up as
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals not representing government
agencies are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do encounter people who work or have
worked with the EPA, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the FDA has rotational
advisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're not just like,
oh, I'm working with the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to work with them for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people say that, but oftentimes
they're rotated in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they work for a year, then they're
off for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that allows some
interesting dynamics there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think whether or not the US
government participates, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also worth pointing out that groups like
the United States Pharmacopeia,
[SPEAKER_00]: the USP, a lot of people talk about this,
that's not a government agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a non-governmental agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost a lot of standards groups are
non-governmental agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're independent and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just say, you know, the
standards process with ASTM is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take years to develop and release.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us eight years to develop the
standards that have been adopted in over
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 states for best practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see something similar with
ASTM, but it's best to start early because
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it remains schedule one,
I would make a significant bet,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a two to one on it,
that if ASTM was to release the standard
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow, it would be rapidly adopted in
all the states as saying, you must follow
[SPEAKER_00]: standards equivalent to this ASTM standard
because it is the international body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would supplant a lot of perhaps
what they're referencing now in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature or complement what they're,
you know, I can give you an example maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, must train employees according
to standards by ASTM or must, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: have security practices in line or equal
to the standards at ASTM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, whether or not
the US is ready for international trade,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some ways it's already happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: GW's Sativex, Epidolex, do you think they
need it rescheduled to get their products
[SPEAKER_00]: in the country?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their market advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the University of Mississippi
with their cannabis production,
[SPEAKER_00]: their market advantage right now is the
schedule one and their single license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we have to think about a
little skeptically is that some groups
[SPEAKER_00]: like pharmaceutical companies may not need
it rescheduled to do what they want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with international trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis products can't be made
here really, but they can be shipped here
[SPEAKER_00]: such as like, again, Sativex and licensed
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that whether or not it gets
rescheduled, people need to be ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: the next wave of standards because even if
cannabis got rescheduled and let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: say for sake of argument, went to schedule
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would change for all the dispensers
and industries in California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably nothing because they'd all still
be federal, legal, non FDA approved
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we would see is an increasing
ability of our own government to issue
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EPA might be able to start to say,
oh, it's not a schedule one substance
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can issue some pesticide guidance
officially, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now all pesticide use of
cannabis, even if it's appropriate,
[SPEAKER_00]: safe, is illegal because it's a schedule
one substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandatory minimums, criminal penalties,
access to banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these issues might loosen up if
the wheels were greased by a change of
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduling status, but we still have a lot
of work to do to harmonize that federal
[SPEAKER_00]: and state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's this weird area where we're on
track to harmonize federal and state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of milestones to reach,
but just because that's happening doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that international standards aren't
going to be becoming mandated in those
[SPEAKER_00]: states that have cannabis programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, since the standardization process is
so long, I'm actually quite relieved that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's already an international body
who's getting started now so that by the
[SPEAKER_01]: time that we reschedule or de-schedule,
there are standards that are already in
[SPEAKER_01]: place instead of starting that 20 year
process whenever we get around to
[SPEAKER_01]: de-schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for being on the show,
John.
