[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we don't have anybody that's
advocating for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure your mom's so proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was crazy that your mom
didn't know when you were in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mom's like, why are you in the
hospital?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was totally... It's funny to chop it
up with your mom on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so far out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom's hysterical.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she's this... She's so naive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous, but she is an absolute
super genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a chainsaw, a mental chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you engage her in her world,
she's frighteningly bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frighteningly bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's so earnest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she asks questions of... People will
come on your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be like, crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she'll like... And they're like,
oh, here's a polite answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's Kevin's mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Kevin's mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I laugh and people trip out and they
go, why do you let your mom into your life
[SPEAKER_00]: like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, because it allows them to be
able to enjoy your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to give it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave you life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave a lot of their life to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the trade when you get
older is that you have to allow them to
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy your life too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we make deals where if it's
personal stuff from the past that
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be said online, I get her up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going too far with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anything else you want,
you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great because my mother's hysterical
in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, my god, you look for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: But brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
