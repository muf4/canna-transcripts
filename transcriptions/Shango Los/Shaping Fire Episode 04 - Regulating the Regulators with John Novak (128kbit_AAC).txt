[SPEAKER_00]: Legal marijuana is not something just for
the West Coast anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis reform is spreading like wildfire
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the election process last week,
licensed adult use marijuana states
[SPEAKER_00]: expanded to include California,
Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada,
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of the existing Washington,
Colorado, Oregon, and Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes eight states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, Arkansas, Florida,
Montana, and North Dakota joined the other
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 states where medical cannabis is now
blessed and regulated and taxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona is the only state to have had a
marijuana initiative on the ballot this
[SPEAKER_00]: year that failed to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily though, while Arizona adult use
didn't pass, they have a pre-existing
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana law to benefit Arizona
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this all means is that there's going
to be a whole lot of cannabis-related
[SPEAKER_00]: rulemaking at the state level in the next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we have seen from other states already
though, that is likely going to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptionally messy process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned from Dr. Dominic Korva on the
show two weeks ago that even though
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis policy transfer from other states
that are already legal is becoming more
[SPEAKER_00]: common, many of the legislators and
rulemakers at the state level have zero
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and knowledge of cannabis and
they very likely wish they didn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every state has made cannabis legalization
way more complex than it needs to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: both because they are unfamiliar with
cannabis and rulemakers are still afraid
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis and think it means violent
crime will increase when actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we are certainly going to see
going forward is a patchwork of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: laws that are different from state to
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this much rulemaking going on all at
once, you can be assured that there will
[SPEAKER_00]: be some backdoor deal making between
legislators, law enforcement, business
[SPEAKER_00]: people, and others who will seek to exert
undue influence on how cannabis policy is
[SPEAKER_00]: formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask you, who will be watching these
rulemakers to ensure that they follow
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate laws concerning governance and
rulemaking for new law?
[SPEAKER_00]: No one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no one responsible to make sure
that bureaucratic regulators are
[SPEAKER_00]: performing their role in a legal way.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in Washington state, for example,
the liquor and cannabis spore has already
[SPEAKER_00]: been found guilty of meeting secretly with
law enforcement and others, but only after
[SPEAKER_00]: citizens caught them doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's show is about citizen oversight of
cannabis law implementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to consider some of the ways
that lobbyists can try to influence
[SPEAKER_00]: policy, how regulators have attempted to
make rules in the shadows, and we will
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss some citizen oversight strategies
that you can use to help your state
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators stay honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is John Novak, founder of
420leaks.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420leaks.com is a citizen oversight
organization that focuses on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: policy in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their researchers obtain hard to find
information through public records
[SPEAKER_00]: requests, as well as daily monitoring of
state bills, rulemaking, local ordinances,
[SPEAKER_00]: and news that will have an effect on
cannabis patients, providers, and
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very appreciative that you asked me to
come on, looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know we've been trying to put this
together for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we finally got a chance to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John, a lot of people, they kind of
like to have the idea that their state
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators and legislators are having
their best interests at heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they like to just assume that their
government officials are following the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, we know that that is
not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we start by giving a little
bit of a context of why 420leaks is
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: From your extensive research, who are some
of the other groups interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: influencing cannabis reform at the state
level, and why are they trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: influence it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we have all the local activists
who each have their own issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of it human rights based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the home grows and sharing,
descheduling, those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we have the business
interests who are looking out for their
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom line and regulating the industry in
improper ways and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have other tiers of interested
parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are more, the biggest ones I
would say are the state, the agency lobby
[SPEAKER_01]: firms and associations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for instance, the Association of
Washington Cities and Counties,
[SPEAKER_01]: they all have their big lobby group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have, oh, for instance,
the Liquor Control Board, they have their
[SPEAKER_01]: own lobby group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Health will have their own
lobby group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those kinds of groups are,
that's really what you see down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have kind of what I call the
hidden persuaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they seem to be the ones that are more
from Wall Street firms that are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: come in and basically run the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't really see a whole lot of
their faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see one or two, but for the most part,
you don't even see them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a lot of their work behind the
scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the state agencies, those have been
the hardest on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they seem to have the most impact as
far as regulating or I shouldn't say
[SPEAKER_01]: regulating, but for instance, like zoning
stuff and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the biggest problems that we
hear from those guys is that they are
[SPEAKER_01]: scared of federal law, they say,
and implementing any of this stuff at the
[SPEAKER_01]: state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They believe leaves them open to
prosecution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lot of the big push that they
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other side of it too is they rely
on federal funds, federal grants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Health gets grants for
different areas of healthcare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liquor Control Board, I'm not sure if they
have a federal grant program in place yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the cities and the counties especially
are really tied into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They receive a lot of federal money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question that I'm trying to find
out is, is the tax money from 502 enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to offset that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite sure yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are the biggest groups that have
been down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm gathering here from your
answer is that every state is gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of players that are trying to
influence policy and some that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: expecting, but then there's a lot of extra
folks with priorities that are kind of in
[SPEAKER_00]: the shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Substance abuse is another group that you
see a lot of down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I guess in probably law
enforcement too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So putting myself in the seat of the
regulator or the legislator who is the
[SPEAKER_00]: target of the influence and also the
target of your research to help keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it isn't necessarily that they are
trying to be bad actors themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the fact that they're being
influenced from all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need watchdogs in each state who
are making sure that folks are not bending
[SPEAKER_00]: or breaking the rules in their influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a pretty fair way to look at it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the watchdog is just looking to
make sure that people are playing by the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our state though, keeping an eye on the
legislators is a little bit harder because
[SPEAKER_01]: they have exempted themselves from most of
the public records.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about the only way that I can get
public records on them as if they were to
[SPEAKER_01]: make like a public statement about a
document that they used in order to come
[SPEAKER_01]: up with a policy, something along those
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I could ask them, hey,
well, I want to see that document.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, the legislators are
pretty much off the boards and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: ask, but they're not under any kind of
requirement to turn over any records.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of one of the ways that I get
around that though is I'll go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: agency side and say, I want to see your
communications with specific legislators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I can get it, sometimes I
don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of how much information
that they were actually willing to put
[SPEAKER_01]: down on paper and send back and forth
between each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as keeping tabs on the
legislators, one of the better ways is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to the Public Disclosure Commission
website and following where all the
[SPEAKER_01]: campaign contributions are going.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very big part of this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work that you do is obviously very
arcane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people know how to request
these documents that you uncover that can
[SPEAKER_00]: show the corruption or the bending of the
rules or whatever you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's go step by step, to a certain
degree, on how you decide what records you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're talking about getting these
records.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, to a novice like me,
I don't even know how you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I'm thinking about is that Freedom of
Information Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know if that's the
appropriate rule in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: For folks who are seeking to emulate you
down the line, kind of just give us a
[SPEAKER_00]: blueprint of how you get these documents
at a state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's start with just 502 in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it passed, the state, now it's called
the Liquor and Cannabis Board,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then it was called the Liquor Control
Board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each agency, when the legislature
passes a bill and puts rulemaking power
[SPEAKER_01]: into the hands of the state agencies,
like was done with 502, then the Liquor
[SPEAKER_01]: Control Board goes through a process of
gathering as much information from various
[SPEAKER_01]: sources, including the public,
normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they will put together a package
and then implement the rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in our state, we have an actual RCW
that defines how that information has to
[SPEAKER_01]: be maintained by the agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's called the Rulemaking File.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can request that full file and then
they're supposed to give you everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have on hand that led them to
the decision-making on that specific rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for instance, the thousand foot rule
for how close cannabis businesses could be
[SPEAKER_01]: to a school or a park or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was an actual rule making
process where they had to take input and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that kind of stuff and document it and
keep it on file.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can ask for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a simple step to take with the
agencies is just asking for their
[SPEAKER_01]: rulemaking file.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of the 502 rulemaking file,
we got a lot of information from it
[SPEAKER_01]: originally, but we started seeing that
there was a lot of information that was
[SPEAKER_01]: being left out, specific meetings with law
enforcement, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kept digging further and asking
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, we started getting some of
that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't always know what you're going
to get, of course, when you ask for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you have to kind of get a general idea
of what you're looking for, at least,
[SPEAKER_01]: to give a general idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say ask for, what does that
actually mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is that as simple as sending an
email to somebody and asking for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that there's some application
you have to fill out or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a couple of different ways
you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it with a handwritten letter
and ask for specific documents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we're talking about the liquor
and cannabis board, each agency has their
[SPEAKER_01]: own public records division, and they have
their own rules set around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a small fee if they have to
scan over hard copy documents into
[SPEAKER_01]: electronic version.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a charge there or printing
and scanning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So minimum types of charges.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, what it is, you go to the
liquor control board, and on their page,
[SPEAKER_01]: you look for public records on the side
panel, and you go there, and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually give you an email address.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's publicrecords.lcb.wa.gov.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just ask, basically ask for what
you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I do it is I start off,
and I just say public records request in
[SPEAKER_01]: the subject line of the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll say in the main body of the
message, like, this is a public records
[SPEAKER_01]: request for the thousand foot rulemaking
file.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like these in electronic format if
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, I sign my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give them my phone number and send it
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be as more complicated if you're
looking, say, for specific tax
[SPEAKER_01]: disbursements to specific agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go general.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go very specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just all really depends on what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually surprised at how easy it
actually sounds like it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a request that sounds like
just how anybody else, anybody could do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it sounds like there's a certain
amount of discretion on the receiver of
[SPEAKER_00]: the email, too, because you're asking for
whatever you're asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be redefined by the person on
the receiving side about how much scope of
[SPEAKER_00]: work they're going to do to answer your
request.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll actually, usually they will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, let's say I hit the send
button.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent that request in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the agency has five business days
from there to respond back to me to let me
[SPEAKER_01]: know, OK, we got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are not completely sure of what
you're asking, they may ask you to clarify
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might restate it in a way they think
that you're asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you have to follow up and make
sure, yeah, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it is what you asked for and you
feel that they have it right in their
[SPEAKER_01]: head, what you want, then you just let
them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that you got to keep
on top and at least respond back and make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that you're actually getting or
they're telling what they're telling you
[SPEAKER_01]: is what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have to give you a specific
time period on approximately how long they
[SPEAKER_01]: believe it'll take for them to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a little bit of work,
but in the long run for each individual
[SPEAKER_01]: one, it really doesn't take a whole lot of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, again, keeping tabs on their
responses and making sure you respond back
[SPEAKER_01]: the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take our first short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into something as
deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there is more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage loyalty in the customers you
already have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you certainly don't have the time and
you're not ready to hire someone full time
[SPEAKER_00]: for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blunt Branding principals Kirsten Nelson
and Anthony Garcia are focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they leave responsibility for
improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is pretty much the most important
part of marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and Anthony will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale, and keep them coming back to you
and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on three
projects now for various clients and every
[SPEAKER_00]: single time they have done more than they
have promised and over-delivered on
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making me a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every friend I've referred them
to has come back to thank me and that just
[SPEAKER_00]: does not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grab a pen and paper because the
website address is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_00]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_00]: while using cutting edge technology in the
background that make all of this easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is John Novak of 420leaks.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John, before the break, we were talking
about how to get the files targeted to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're looking for and then how
to go ahead and put in a request for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually was surprisingly easy
compared to what I thought it was gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that one of the things that you
have found is very often you will be
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for particular documents and they
should exist because most states have some
[SPEAKER_00]: version of the Open Meetings Act where
when they meet to talk about future
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations and laws that they have to
document that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you found that, at least in
Washington, this wasn't happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that people should
be looking for to potentially happen at
[SPEAKER_00]: every state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you tell us a little bit
about that so people know what to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we found early on
was that the Liquor and Cannabis Board
[SPEAKER_01]: were having secret meetings with law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they began publishing their calendar
of events and we were seeing that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were having these public meetings in the
big cities like Spokane, Seattle,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Yakima.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they were also listing that they
were having meetings with these different
[SPEAKER_01]: groups during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And according to our state law,
if two or more of the board members meet
[SPEAKER_01]: together, it becomes an actual official
meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The public needs to be notified and their
input needs to be considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going through the rulemaking file,
again, seeing they're asking for their
[SPEAKER_01]: calendar of events, then you can kind of
get an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, what's being publicized openly
and what's not?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of how we started
catching them on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to say they're having secret meetings,
I just want to drill down that a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit because that could be hyperbole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secret seems to suggest some kind of ill
will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that these were intentionally
being hidden or did they just not make no
[SPEAKER_00]: one put it in the file?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it seem like an accidental oversight
or does it feel like they were
[SPEAKER_00]: intentionally trying to keep this out of
the file?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's another great part of one of
the things you can ask for is the
[SPEAKER_01]: communications between people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we asked for all communications as
well on this specific thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started seeing that the meetings
were being set up by the Liquor Control
[SPEAKER_01]: Board staff at the request of law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the concern was the law
enforcement wanted to have the full
[SPEAKER_01]: attention of the Liquor Control Board
without having to talk around the general
[SPEAKER_01]: public.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just wanted their group, their
message.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all well and good if you're
having a meeting with an individual board
[SPEAKER_01]: member.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you put the board together,
then you're getting into a whole different
[SPEAKER_01]: level of public integrity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was, we could see in the
communications that that's what they were
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not want the public to be
participating to counter any message that
[SPEAKER_01]: they were trying to get across.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be really odd to read those
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you write an email,
you're talking to another person
[SPEAKER_00]: personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're speaking to them in regular
language.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are going into a bureaucratic
file of documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably see some things in those
emails, which are both odd, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: telling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start to pull out people's intent
if you're reading them in their own
[SPEAKER_00]: language, if you read all the messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You very much can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for whatever reason, they continue to
write their emails back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, some of the things that we've
got some of them saying basically just
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't, for the most part,
these agencies don't have a lot of good
[SPEAKER_01]: things to say about the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about phone calls?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everything happen via email so that
there's an official paper trail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how would they document phone calls
that would take place between a lobbyist
[SPEAKER_00]: and a regulator?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lobbyist and that's a whole different side
of public records because they go under
[SPEAKER_01]: the Public Disclosure Commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I spent about two years studying up on
politics and money and all that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff before we got involved with actual
political action committee stuff because I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to make sure that we followed the
rules and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really have complete answers
for you on lobby requirements and bills
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that I was somewhat
disappointed in finding out was that when
[SPEAKER_01]: lobbyists write or present bills,
there really is no requirement that that
[SPEAKER_01]: be disclosed to anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that is must be disclosed
on the lobby side is the if money is being
[SPEAKER_01]: spent one way or the other, for instance,
if the lobbyists were to go and take them
[SPEAKER_01]: out to dinner or give them some kind of
gift or something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those kinds of things have to be reported,
travel expenses, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was really the only way that I
found that you can see what lobbyists are
[SPEAKER_01]: behind what bills is one, go down to the
public hearings and see who is coming on
[SPEAKER_01]: board with them, or two, look and see what
lobby firms are contributing to what
[SPEAKER_01]: candidates and to which.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other side of lobbying, too,
is not just candidates that they give
[SPEAKER_01]: these contributions to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also go to committee caucuses,
party committees, and those groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no limit on what you can give to
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a limit on what you can give to a
candidate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, a business lobby firm had
about $50,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say probably 20,000 of it may have
gone out to about 20 different candidates
[SPEAKER_01]: at about $1,000 each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you'll see big chunks of money being
pushed to these caucus or party
[SPEAKER_01]: committees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The parties then distribute it from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The caucus committees are more
issue-driven, apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of wheels that need to be
greased by lobby money in order to get
[SPEAKER_01]: bills passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has been both a very eye-opening and
very revealing part of this whole study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the biggest puzzle, though,
because there's a lot more pieces that you
[SPEAKER_01]: gotta put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a puzzle is actually a really good
example because as I sit here and listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to you, when you were telling me about the
master file that's kept about the
[SPEAKER_00]: deliberations before a regulation is made,
I was thinking to myself, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's great that they keep all that stuff
at one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, we need to watchdog them to
make sure that everything goes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: file, but that's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can watch how our regulations are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then your next set of information
was all like, oh, yeah, we can't track
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't track that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find out who the lobbyists are working
on something, you need to go and see who's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly, this tore up my conception that
this was transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it suddenly feels very not
transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine you having to read all of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that most of it is pretty
mundane emails and communications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of a sudden, you find somebody
saying something that refers to something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you haven't seen anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then things start to unravel, but you have
to dig forever just to find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't sound very transparent
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest details, of course,
is finding which lobbyist wrote this bill,
[SPEAKER_01]: which went to this senator, to this
committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the real legwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot more than just sending
public requests back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does take a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be very time consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a whole other wing of activism
that really needs its own staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have, again, back to the agency
public records.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost, again, its own staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: In any given year or two, we also have
these state agencies will go crying to the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislators saying that, oh, this is
costing us way too many man hours to find
[SPEAKER_01]: all these records.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a constant tug of war.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's the price of a
democracy though.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're doing this research,
you just must be elated when you find a
[SPEAKER_00]: thread to pull on though.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to spend a couple days
trolling or not trolling, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the right word, but anyway,
digging through a big pot of documents and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you find one thing, you're like,
oh, here's something that could give me
[SPEAKER_00]: cause to make a new records request
because now you can get more specific or
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody referring to an idea or a meeting
that is not in the rest of the file,
[SPEAKER_00]: that must be very gratifying at that point
because you're like, oh, here's something
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a little bit of training in your
mind to listen a little harder for key
[SPEAKER_01]: words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a study released by Department
of Health and I think in collaboration
[SPEAKER_01]: with a couple of other agencies,
Liquor Control Board and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they wanted to look at how 502 and all
of this was impacting our youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they came up with a study that they
went out to different high schools to see
[SPEAKER_01]: how it was affecting the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the conclusions they came up
with left me scratching my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just by the sheer fact that they did a
study and sent people out makes you
[SPEAKER_01]: realize, aha, there's a document there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a list of questions somewhere that
they were asking people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I saw the file, basically the
information that I saw that led me to this
[SPEAKER_01]: was a PowerPoint presentation put on by
the Department of Health that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: presenting to legislators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was reading down through all the
slides and I kept coming across these
[SPEAKER_01]: different study points and a couple of
them really had me scratching my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, okay, I need to see the
study and where all this information was
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from because one of the things they
were claiming was that the minorities were
[SPEAKER_01]: having a harder problem with it in the
schools than the white folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, this is sounding a little,
I don't want to say racist, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the research that I've seen in the
past showed that blacks and whites use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis at a pretty even rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why they were saying that the black
kids in school were having a harder time
[SPEAKER_01]: with it, I want to know more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I asked for the actual study and I just
got that a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a chance to go through and
look at it, but seeing on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: they had done a study that I knew then,
okay, I can ask for that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on, I follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes for some pretty detailed reading,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hey, we're gonna take our- It's a good
way to put yourself to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to take our second break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look inside this crystal ball with me for
a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking just a couple months into the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing the future of the Shaping Fire
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show sure has grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've continued to interview fascinating
cannabis industry luminaries and our
[SPEAKER_00]: audience has gotten huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has doubled and redoubled and doubled
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are high fives all around the
Shaping Fire world headquarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: New listeners are subscribing every day
and begin to listen to the back catalog of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the great interviews there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where the Shaping Fire
audience learns about your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were incredibly smart today to become
an early adopter and place a commercial in
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire's early episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, today, you are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay a fraction of the cost we'll be asking
in just two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, all the audience that listens to
our back catalog of interviews will hear
[SPEAKER_00]: about your company again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
so new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_00]: listening audience we will have forever.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Losin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this week is John Novak of
420leaks.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John, during the show today,
you have described a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: detail-oriented work, a lot of pushing
against the bureaucracy, but also with
[SPEAKER_00]: important wins of being able to keep
regulators honest and essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: defending the citizenry of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal, of course, of the show is to
inspire people in other states that are
[SPEAKER_00]: just coming online with cannabis and
starting to normalize and moving towards
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of legalization to inspire folks
to watch their own state regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gotta ask you, what are some of the
challenges personally to doing this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of work?
[SPEAKER_01]: The personal challenge is, the hardest one
is just keeping yourself motivated to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through all this boring stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, especially when you get in
gigabyte after gigabyte of information,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's one of the hardest things to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to get other people to help out,
that's been a struggle because it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: the funnest work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rewards, you may have to go weeks,
if not months before you see any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, you're doing it and you're
passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've got to know that it's
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, somebody's got to watch the
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why for you do you feel that it's
important that people like you stand up
[SPEAKER_00]: and watch the government to make sure that
they are doing things by rule of law?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I actually started doing,
I would say my skills on this came
[SPEAKER_01]: actually from doing a due diligence on
stock for the stock market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a lot of going through and
reading all the company documents and
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring out where money's coming in,
where it's going out, if they actually
[SPEAKER_01]: have a product and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just takes a lot of going through a
lot of boring, boring information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it is super important to do if
you take investing seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of the training that I
had going into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and it really kind of started out for
me, of course, I wanted to see where all
[SPEAKER_01]: the laws were going since I am a patient
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also wanted to see how what kind of
environment I would be getting myself into
[SPEAKER_01]: if I decided to enter into the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really the biggest push for
me of why I wanted to do all this,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if I, you know, first off,
we got, you know, let's let's be honest
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is still against federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a that's in and of itself means
you got to so many different areas of law.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you got to make sure your butt's
covered on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to follow not only state law,
you got to follow what the feds are doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of get an idea of what other states
are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that attention to detail and due
diligence is really what gave me my push
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefits of doing it, though,
are absolutely wonderful, because instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of relying on, let's say what the press is
telling you what's going on or what any
[SPEAKER_01]: individual legislator or even any
individual activist might be telling you
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have the actual documents in
front of you, you see what's being said.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you just you have a much better
understanding of the entire situation
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're taking it from the horse's
mouth instead of, you know, different
[SPEAKER_01]: spins on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, I think, is one of the most
valuable parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the to a certain degree,
I wish it was more keeping politicians and
[SPEAKER_01]: the state agencies honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biggest threat that if we don't do
this is that they'll just think that
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody's watching and they can get away
with whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't then they'll take they won't
take the full steps to completely document
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the worst extremes, of corruption
that we've you know, you hear about in the
[SPEAKER_01]: news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, when I talk to other
activists and even some legislators and
[SPEAKER_01]: people in this, they say as a whole,
our country is and local government is
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming more corrupt than than more
honest these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is, you know, in a lot of ways,
I think that this activism really has more
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with about open government than it
does about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this might be kind of a
bittersweet question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I know you've dedicated,
well, at least your life right now to
[SPEAKER_00]: this, because this is your your main
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, how do you know when you're
succeeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this seems like you are,
you know, you're working on this ocean
[SPEAKER_00]: trove of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do you how do you know when
you're winning?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the easiest way to know that when
you're winning is, of course, you get
[SPEAKER_01]: attention from the president.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get attention from the press or
legislators, and they'll come up and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, we want to change what you're seeing
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an immediate type of win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be very gratifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, though, most of the wins
come in ways that you can kind of see your
[SPEAKER_01]: information is influencing the public
debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though your name is not specifically
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that a lot in the let's I won't
bring up any big names, but some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger newspapers in this in the area
absolutely refuse to have to publish my
[SPEAKER_01]: name for 20 leaks or anything to do with
it, because they are interested in a
[SPEAKER_01]: multibillion dollar industry continuing,
which I'm all for, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's you know, let's do it honestly
here, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I do see a lot of that,
though, when a bigger story will come out
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you'll and you'll kind of start
hearing about, you know, the debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say, for instance, the there was a
massive leak where the Laker control board
[SPEAKER_01]: accidentally turned over private
information on applicants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some of the the cannabis reporters
jumped on that immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then at the higher level of,
you know, of, you know, let's say like
[SPEAKER_01]: through Seattle Times, the you know,
the bigger the Spokane Chronicle or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the bigger newspapers,
they didn't cover that until the liquor
[SPEAKER_01]: control board actually started sending out
letters to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the big news got in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, for the most part, we weren't
we didn't get a lot of credit for that
[SPEAKER_01]: leak.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we started seeing a bigger issue
being talked about about private about
[SPEAKER_01]: patient privacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes you don't get the credit,
but you can see that your point was made
[SPEAKER_01]: and the debate is beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so you have to kind of a lot of
it is you don't you don't get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: credit for some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the debate moves forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really the end goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be the the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the debate is moving forward,
you're winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's let's finish up with this last
question, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if if, you know,
my goal with this show is that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to reach out to our listeners
across the country and maybe have them
[SPEAKER_00]: hear your story about what you're doing in
Washington and inspire them to do that in
[SPEAKER_00]: their own state, because you know,
if it takes your full time to do
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, you know, we need at least 49
other people across the country to be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this so that each state can be
covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so somebody out there is listening
and they're listening to the work that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds, you know, interesting and
engaging to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're thinking about doing this in
their own state.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say to them to help inspire
them to move forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find this is both the
hardest and most but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: most rewarding thing that you'll do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're you'll you're going to find a lot
of a lot of garbage in there that has no
[SPEAKER_01]: real revel or real no meaning to exactly
what it is you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that that drives me is
the human rights angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That every person out there should have
the right to plant a seed and take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have a focus like that,
it kind of narrows down to a degree what
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically you're going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and it helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and the other thing it does is it when
you're sending out those requests,
[SPEAKER_01]: it puts those agencies on notice that
you're watching them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most sometimes, you know,
they're so big, they have so much money
[SPEAKER_01]: and influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when when you take that information
and then make it public and then suddenly
[SPEAKER_01]: they take it a little more seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's what I began to find
that you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do you get the information that
you're looking for in a more complete
[SPEAKER_01]: picture, but you also begin to develop a
reputation, especially with legislators
[SPEAKER_01]: that while they may not like what you're
doing, they know why you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, they really don't
have much to say to the negative side on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being able to inform your fellow
activists of exactly what's going on and
[SPEAKER_01]: what these laws and so it helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps your group to really define where
the issues you need to focus are.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us get caught up in a lot of the
extraneous stuff, you know, and the red
[SPEAKER_01]: hats versus the blue hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or should we have like six plants versus
eight plants or four?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times you get groups that
kind of split apart and get trapped into a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you you focus on specific
issues and you can see where the enemy or
[SPEAKER_01]: the obstacle is, it becomes easier when
you go in with a handful of documents,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when they're in their own words
and you say this is why it needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here and actually that's another point
of the thing is you can find a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that's wrong and they do want to
hear some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really what they're looking for is,
OK, how do we make it right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you cannot get to that step of how do
I make it right until you have all the
[SPEAKER_01]: information in front of you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the biggest part of why I think
this is most important.
