[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, thank you for being here and
welcome to the 230 panel on Cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: Myths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please silence your cell phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been having a heck of a lot of
problem with that today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Shango Los, host of the Shaping Fire
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like listening to smart interviews
with the top minds in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: I invite you to check out the show at
shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have an extraordinary YouTube
channel with over 150 speaker videos I
[SPEAKER_03]: record at events just like this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, all three of our panelists today
appear on the Shaping Fire YouTube
[SPEAKER_03]: channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, our speakers on our panel today are
Colin Bell, to immediately to my right
[SPEAKER_03]: into him, is co-founder and chief growth
officer of Grossentia Mammoth Microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He received his PhD in biological sciences
specializing in soil microbial ecology and
[SPEAKER_03]: plant microbe interactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next to Colin is Peter Konjoyan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter created his research and consulting
business, Konjoyan Horticulture Education
[SPEAKER_03]: Services, Incorporated in 1992 and has
been immersed in both the commercial and
[SPEAKER_03]: research areas of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse industry for several decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: His current research is focused on
controlled environment agriculture and
[SPEAKER_03]: hydroponic crop production.
[SPEAKER_03]: To his farthest side is our good friend
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff Lowenfels, author of the seminal
Teeming with Microbes, Teeming with
[SPEAKER_03]: Nutrients, and Teeming with Fungi Books
series on the Soil Food Web.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff, when I asked him for his bio for
today, even though I've said it many
[SPEAKER_03]: times, I said, do you have any upgrades?
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, no, just skip my bio and say,
oh, where'd it go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ruin your joke, Shango.
[SPEAKER_03]: That Jeff might be Lord of the Roots and
write books, but he is most proud of
[SPEAKER_03]: starting Plant a Row for the Hungry,
a program designed to get every gardener
[SPEAKER_03]: in the United States to grow one row of
food to donate to someone who needs it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to buy his books,
but you do need to plant a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, our panel today is a little different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is entitled Dispelling Myth in
Commercial Cannabis Cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I was talking with the guys in
advance of the panel, I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: so what do we want to talk about that
hasn't been done again and again and again
[SPEAKER_03]: at cultivation?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all started talking about the
things that people do that bug them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, all right, I got a list of
all these things that the guys hate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, all right, that'll be the
theme.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's call it Dispelling Myths.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all new content from the fellows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, question one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get warmed up with something really
open-ended.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're going to start with Colin,
and then Jeff, and then Peter on this
[SPEAKER_03]: question, so everyone can jump in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Colin, one thing we have all seen is
how much in cannabis we all need to
[SPEAKER_03]: unlearn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Myths are everywhere, from people who
think you can identify the sex of a seed
[SPEAKER_03]: by looking at it, to others thinking that
you can get higher if you hold your hit
[SPEAKER_03]: long enough to cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And both are obviously untrue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cultivation has its own wide range of
myths.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Colin, and then Jeff and Peter,
what is a cultivation myth that you still
[SPEAKER_03]: see people talking about that needs to be
identified and fixed within cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: horticulture practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think I'll start with simple
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to be a little academic
and a little geeky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea that you don't need microbes
or microbes aren't important in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture systems and that you can
actually sterilize systems, any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic or root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no such thing as a sterile system
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really fully sterilize anything,
not food, not water, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, the idea of thinking that you can
work with a sterile system is completely
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I would like to start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what do you think the ramifications
are of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the ramifications of thinking
you're dealing with a sterile system are,
[SPEAKER_00]: one, you're attempting to sterilize a
system that's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're putting a lot of effort in
buying a lot of disinfecting chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're flushing through your root
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you're spending time and money
doing something that's not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fruitful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second part of that, and I think
more importantly, you will knock off a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of microbes when you flush disinfectants
through a root zone of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of these are going to be
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, what I think is a real challenge
with that paradigm is you're going to kill
[SPEAKER_00]: off a lot of beneficial microbes that you
really want to have within your
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere, within your grow zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to promote, potentially,
the competitive advantage of pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: that can exist in that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would say is if we can bridge
the gap of understanding how to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: natural processes into these precision
hydroponic agriculture environments and
[SPEAKER_00]: fight biology against biology,
you can actually learn to nurture
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial microbes to balance out the
potential pests that will inhabit your
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone without them being there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I do a Bernie Sanders?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, you're up next anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, same question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have a different answer,
but I just want to add onto that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, from my perspective, and it's not
a perfect analogy, is if you read my
[SPEAKER_06]: second book, things don't go into a cell
unless they have an electrical charge on
[SPEAKER_06]: them, with the exception of boron.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the microbes that put the charge on.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I put it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't have the microbes,
you don't have the charge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't have the charge,
you're not getting anything in your cells
[SPEAKER_06]: that you want to get in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why we do it that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what bugs me more than anything?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, cultivation bugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when we first had this
discussion, I was going to say flushing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But since then, I've been working and
thinking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to say, worse than that,
removing leaves, live leaves from a plant,
[SPEAKER_06]: ostensibly in order to get more light on
the bud so that it will fatten up and grow
[SPEAKER_06]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot, for the love of me, see why
anybody would in the life of me want to do
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would they want to take a
photosynthesizing factory and shut it
[SPEAKER_06]: down?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that just doesn't make any sense at
all.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you happen to believe that the sun is
what causes that bud to swell by falling
[SPEAKER_06]: directly on the bud itself, even though it
has a limited amount of photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_06]: leaves in it, you can take the leaf and
just sort of bend it out of the way,
[SPEAKER_06]: or clip it out of the way, or tape it out
of the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't cut live leaves from a plant,
period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter, same question to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a cultivation myth that you want to
expose some light on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I want to first build on what Colin
referenced about the natural biome around
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the past 15 years as a traditional
commercial greenhouse researcher,
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been working with water treatment,
the chemicals that Colin mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to be careful with.
[SPEAKER_05]: My work has been treating systems and
irrigation lines so that we can reduce
[SPEAKER_05]: algae, biofilm, and plant pathogen
populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could draw an analogy between East
and Western medicine and how over our
[SPEAKER_05]: lifetime we seem to be meeting somewhere
in the middle, we now need to find that
[SPEAKER_05]: sweet spot where we can control the algae
and the biofilm throughout the system but
[SPEAKER_05]: not be injecting enough to harm the
natural balance of the microbes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for me, it's all about research,
research, learning, gaining knowledge,
[SPEAKER_05]: and Colin and I are talking about how we
might collaborate and bring the two worlds
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: My pet peeve, or the myth that I'd like to
dispel, is whenever I'm in a hydroponic
[SPEAKER_05]: supply store and I walk down the
fertilizer aisle, in my opinion as a
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional horticulturist, there are way
too many fertilizer products, and while I
[SPEAKER_05]: acknowledge and am trying to learn quickly
the nuances with the cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: because I've spent my research career on
poinsettias and geraniums and petunias,
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to learn how it's unique,
but I still don't think we need all of
[SPEAKER_05]: those products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Peter, to follow up with that,
if you were to go down that aisle and only
[SPEAKER_03]: keep the type of products that you think
are necessary, what would you keep?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to sidestep that slightly,
Shango, and bring in how Colin and I,
[SPEAKER_05]: with our research training and background,
I'm an Ohio State Buckeye for graduate
[SPEAKER_05]: school.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were?
[SPEAKER_05]: Texas Tech graduate school.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean to exclude you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were Northeastern and Harvard,
correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think what I see is not necessarily
I'm going to pick out which products
[SPEAKER_05]: should be there, Shango, but I think in
this industry, we need more science and
[SPEAKER_05]: research validating the products that are
on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm used to my side of horticulture
going through that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I'm in the trade show downstairs,
and tomorrow in my presentation I'll
[SPEAKER_05]: reference some of this, when I see a booth
that feels the need to say science-based
[SPEAKER_05]: or science-backed in its message,
I'm wondering why does this industry need
[SPEAKER_05]: to do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It must mean that so many others are not
science-based.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a good sidestep, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So question two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next question is about developing
best practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll start with Peter, who was just
speaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Peter's giving a presentation tomorrow
all about how to design your own internal
[SPEAKER_03]: company experiments so that you can
develop next level SOPs and maybe happen
[SPEAKER_03]: to discover some intellectual property
along the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be very interesting,
and that's tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to start with you,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So since we are all growing cannabis as a
commodity, small differentiators between
[SPEAKER_03]: companies make all the difference,
whether they be in marketing, product
[SPEAKER_03]: quality, or distribution expertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis companies with an awareness of
analytics and spreadsheets are setting up
[SPEAKER_03]: in-house cultivation experiments to create
some citizen science right there in the
[SPEAKER_03]: front lines of cannabis growing instead of
in a lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Peter, what is the mindset that you
recommend to commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivators who want to embark on setting
up experiments under their own roof,
[SPEAKER_03]: and where should they start?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to start out by trying to dispel
another myth, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hear the word research, and it can
sound intimidating or dry or difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a 65-year-old, I'm still as excited
today as I was at 18 to see a seed
[SPEAKER_05]: germinate or a cutting root.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for you folks as cultivators,
my word is grower on my side of the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we hear the phrase citizen science
scientist these days in our daily lexicon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to say cultivator scientist,
grower scientist, and the excitement about
[SPEAKER_05]: running a trial or an experiment in your
own operation that, if designed correctly,
[SPEAKER_05]: will result or yield some really good
information that you use to make
[SPEAKER_05]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I get charged up about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to convey to you folks
through the course of the conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Colin, your approach is slightly
different because you're coming out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a real challenge with
understanding how to conduct research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of more complicated,
thought of as more complicated than it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the truth is the more simple research
or an experiment is, the more resolution
[SPEAKER_00]: there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find as a team, and Peter kind
of changed my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met a lot earlier this year,
and we've engaged ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's coming from a horticulturist
point of view, and I'm coming from a
[SPEAKER_00]: research scientist's point of view from
Colorado State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of pretty sophisticated
research for years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecosystem level, lots of interactions,
those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand setting up
experimentation, and I kind of take it for
[SPEAKER_00]: granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a microbiologist creating
technologies, biology that I want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: in agriculture, and I want it to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to collect the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked Peter on the phone point
blank, and this was like early February,
[SPEAKER_00]: why do so many experiments fail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why isn't biology more actively adopted in
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll never forget what he said,
and I wanted a real and biased answer from
[SPEAKER_00]: a horticulturist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, Colin, you might not like
this answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I don't like this answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth is cultivators don't
necessarily, I'm talking generally,
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how to conduct experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over 50% of the trials that you engage
in, and that was from his experience
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to me, are going to be skewed
because of experimental error on the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower side in the grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been testing that hypothesis ever
since, engaging with facilities avidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes one misfeed, or one AC
outage, or one infestation, to completely
[SPEAKER_00]: disseminate an experimental design,
an experimental trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, and again, and again,
it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if someone comes to me and says,
you know, I think I see a result,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not so sure, then you dissect what
happened across that experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: that growth trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either something did happen, or there was
an infestation, or the power went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something that seems like
interfered with the controlled side by
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that the challenge is a
little bit of knowledge, and having a
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated area, facility that's very
controlled, that you can dedicate,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, to a controlled side by side,
where you don't change anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want the resolution on what to add
into your grow, don't change anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be in the same room,
the same climate, the same strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just manipulate one factor,
and then you measure differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see a difference by changing
one factor, and you can repeat that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because science is repeatable,
then you might have something that will
[SPEAKER_00]: bring value to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having the commitment and the time and
the dedication to conduct that trial is
[SPEAKER_00]: very challenging for a lot of commercially
producing facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on, good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of home and patient
growers in the room, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jeff, you know, you've been helping
gardeners better their skills for decades
[SPEAKER_03]: through your 40 plus year gardening
column.
[SPEAKER_03]: How might these ideas apply to a home
grower?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, of course, home growers,
particularly home cannabis growers,
[SPEAKER_06]: are the worst scientist experimenters in
the world, because, you know, we get this
[SPEAKER_06]: idea that, oh, you know, this project,
this is supposed to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I'm only allowed to grow eight
plants, if I put it on one plant and it
[SPEAKER_06]: works, I've wasted seven plants,
you know, I'll put it on all the plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we don't experiment properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have enough discipline to do it
the right way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what I've tried to do in terms of
my books is write books that give you
[SPEAKER_06]: enough science so that you can figure out
what's going on and whether it makes
[SPEAKER_06]: sense, just as we have to learn which
social media platforms we can rely on and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, which news organizations are
real and which aren't real, all this
[SPEAKER_06]: Russian crap, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just as we got to learn that stuff,
we have to do the same thing with regard
[SPEAKER_06]: to where we get our science from.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get a lot of science, because it's so
easy now for people to do, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: geometric stuff and do DNA testing and all
these things we never thought possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do right in your own home,
you know, for maybe a thousand bucks,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can do DNA stuff and people are doing
it, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that doesn't mean they're doing it the
right way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to just be on our toes all the
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have to put pressure on
companies when they are selling us a
[SPEAKER_06]: product to be able to tell us enough about
the product on the websites, which they
[SPEAKER_06]: all have, that gives us confidence in the
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can go to Collins site and go to
Mammoth and we can look up what they have
[SPEAKER_06]: and what they're doing and who they are
and all that kind of stuff as opposed to,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the product you buy that's,
you know, got something on the label that
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't really know about and,
okay, nice picture, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of the miracle grow, you know,
versus being sensible and doing your
[SPEAKER_06]: homework.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to ask a bonus question
before we move on to the third question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what would each of you think would be
an area that a commercial cultivator or
[SPEAKER_03]: even a home grower might want to look into
doing a little of their own research?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think is an area that's ripe
for fresh research?
[SPEAKER_06]: Turpees and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, we still are stuck in
the Sativa Indica base when you go in and
[SPEAKER_06]: purchase and sell, and that's stupid
because we know Indica and Sativa,
[SPEAKER_06]: first of all, may not even exist properly
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: And second of all, we know that that's not
the parameters that we should be using to
[SPEAKER_06]: determine what we're buying.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would say anything you can do to
learn about flavonoids and cannabinoids is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be a big plus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my response is, as a grower,
having grown up on a vegetable farm and
[SPEAKER_05]: run a commercial greenhouse, for me,
it's learning how to... I got the phone,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I just didn't get the watch.
[SPEAKER_05]: God, there isn't a chip because I don't
have enough hands, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So for me, it's experimenting,
learning how to allow that plant to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether it's yield, whether it's size,
whatever it is, how do we manipulate how
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant grows and respect that the
plant's going to grow with or without us,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we're merely there to serve it and
help it reach its potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to redirect you a little bit,
Collin, because I know, because we're
[SPEAKER_03]: buddies, that you've probably toured more
professional cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: operations than anybody around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even globally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you've seen the insides a lot in
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would think that you would have a
different kind of insight about what kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of research could be taken up in those
facilities that would immediately benefit
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm going to kind of pivot from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's research and there's a lot of
things we can do, and we're very
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in quality and terpenes and
cannabinoids and the different strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that can do these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of room for genetics,
and I'm excited about a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about inputs and maximizing
and really dialing in per strain how to
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize growth and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I talk about it all the time,
but honestly, you know, I'm becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: increasingly aware of and kind of focused
on getting a better understanding of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been aware of, like, in the grow
now, it's just like ecology and like
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem ecology is what I'm looking at
in a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different interactive
properties that influence plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's not only genetics,
there's lighting and there's temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's humidity and there's airflow
and there's all these below ground factors
[SPEAKER_00]: like even that, not only the quality of
the water, but the temperature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water and then nutrients you have going in
there and the oxygen flux in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a microbial component and
then there's contamination, all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that it's thought of as
a holistic approach, more than not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when people walk into a grow,
I saw this fascinating technology just
[SPEAKER_00]: this week while I was here where we could
actually analyze hot spots of
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look in a room and see where
there might be potential sources of danger
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as infection, as far as a pest
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could have the cleanest room in
the world except for on the mop handle,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for on the fire hydrant or the fire
extinguisher, except on the cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can be in completely buttoned up
suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's things that you don't know,
you don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never think that the mop that you're
using to clean your facility is a source
[SPEAKER_00]: of contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I saw that, I was like,
wow, you know, how do we get to the level
[SPEAKER_00]: where we understand how to control for
those unknowns or those things that just
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't in our purview?
[SPEAKER_00]: And measuring at that level is where I
think the most important progress of any
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, you know, you have to have the right
genetics and it starts and stops with
[SPEAKER_00]: plant genetics, but you can ruin any plant
genetics as soon as there's an infestation
[SPEAKER_00]: or as soon as there's a temperature drop
or as soon as there is a temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm fascinated by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's a really interesting
environment that's very hard to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I would say,
just this overall awareness of every room
[SPEAKER_00]: is an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And figuring out how to dial in or
mitigate risk over time would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: bring growers more value than any other
research project.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't sure if you leaned forward
because you're going to jump in on that,
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jeff, we're going to start with you on
this question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So during the panel today, we've
encouraged people in different ways to
[SPEAKER_03]: educate and change habits, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look into what your processes are and make
sure that those are the processes you
[SPEAKER_03]: want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we look into the future,
say five years from now, which is a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time in cannabis years, what is one thing
that you see significantly changing in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis horticulture and how might
commercial cannabis cultivators plan for
[SPEAKER_03]: it now as it comes down the line?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, go for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think auto flowers are the next tomato,
both for the home gardener, because I
[SPEAKER_06]: think they're easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're small.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have a photo period problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can grow from seed to harvest in seven
to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a tomato plant that my mother
would grow, particularly once it's legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: She might have even thought about it when
it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: But commercial growers, on the other hand,
really put their nose up in the air about
[SPEAKER_06]: these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: But lately, they are equally as good in my
book as a commercial plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you take into consideration the speed
they grow, auto flowers are the next
[SPEAKER_06]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be seeing them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be seeing them at Lowe's
and Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be seeing them at Christmas
time decorated like little Christmas
[SPEAKER_06]: trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The genetics have changed so drastically
in the past year or two that they are
[SPEAKER_06]: every bit as good as commercial,
large, big gigantic plants that take a
[SPEAKER_06]: long, long time to grow and that have a
photo period necessity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're new to auto flowers and you're
not really familiar with it, oddly enough,
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff and I are both giving talks tomorrow
on autos.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to his.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to his.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff's got a new book coming out in
October, which is auto flowers for
[SPEAKER_03]: beginners and for maybe your neighbor who
you want to get into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: His, at the beginning of the day,
is going to be an introduction to growing
[SPEAKER_03]: auto flowers, kind of a general
introduction to cultivation, period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then my talk in the afternoon at two
thirty is going to be more about
[SPEAKER_03]: patient-oriented medical grow applications
and commercial applications in a bigger
[SPEAKER_03]: scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff, that was auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you, Peter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Reminding you since I kind of took it back
off course, what's one thing that you see
[SPEAKER_03]: significantly changing in cannabis
horticulture in the next five years and
[SPEAKER_03]: how might commercial cannabis cultivators
plan for it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I first respond?
[SPEAKER_05]: Add to something that Jeff said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, from the commercial ornamental
world, we've been trying to do this with
[SPEAKER_05]: poinsettia, which is a short day plant in
chrysanthemum for generations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with breakthroughs here that might then
spread and be applied to other crops,
[SPEAKER_05]: poinsettia is this country's number one
flowering potted plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So far.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well said.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we know of.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been reported.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a poinsettia ruderalis cross,
Peter?
[SPEAKER_05]: As a home beer brewer and a lover of
growing hops in my backyard and the
[SPEAKER_05]: relationship between the crops,
there's just so much excitement going on
[SPEAKER_05]: and bouncing around my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shango, to answer your question,
an interesting dynamic that I see is that
[SPEAKER_05]: the commercial greenhouse grower is now
looking to grow indoors with vertical
[SPEAKER_05]: farming without the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your industry traditionally has grown
indoors without the sun, and you folks are
[SPEAKER_05]: looking to grow in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my messages tomorrow is a plant is
a plant is a plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see a wonderful opportunity to
industries that are passionate about the
[SPEAKER_05]: plants they grow coming together,
working together as horticultural
[SPEAKER_05]: interests.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my message to my growers around the
country that are growing poinsettias and
[SPEAKER_05]: geraniums and having trouble battling the
mass market and low pricing, my message to
[SPEAKER_05]: them is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not us?
[SPEAKER_05]: We know how to grow crops in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just need to retool and learn how to
grow this new species.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my message to you folks is welcome
aboard.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's plenty of room and greenhouse
space for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to dig into that a little bit,
Peter, so are you saying that the big
[SPEAKER_03]: change coming to cannabis cultivation in
five years is that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: moving even more so into greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the point you're making?
[SPEAKER_05]: To a degree, Shango, I am not one that
believes that it's going to end up one
[SPEAKER_05]: size fits all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to have a blend regionally
between outdoor, greenhouse, and indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not going to say that LED lighting
is going to take over the entire industry
[SPEAKER_05]: because I'm on an advisory board for a
medical group up in Maine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have been growing indoors and are
now looking to expand and put up a
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse to complement, supplement.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing quite like those sunshine
fed terpene profiles, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Colin, same thing with you,
brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the next five years, what do you see
as being a significantly changing thing in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis horticulture, and how can
commercial growers prepare for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just having a conversation with
someone else yesterday, Todd McCormick.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really interesting dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been in the industry for a long time,
and he's working with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear this repeatedly, at least in
North America, in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial facilities are scaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so incredibly expensive to
maintain an indoor warehouse style
[SPEAKER_00]: facility through the energy use alone and
the mitigation of pests and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going on that you have to manage,
and the labor and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen several tomato facilities,
large scale commercial tomato,
[SPEAKER_00]: high value tomato facilities that are
growing tomatoes for nothing, swapping
[SPEAKER_00]: over to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point, there's a threshold
where these large scale, very
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated producing companies are
gonna flip to cannabis and change the
[SPEAKER_00]: game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that cannabis is going
to drop, and I don't think cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be the cost of a tomato,
but I think it's gonna drop significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a crystal ball that works,
but I have a sense from enough data points
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in and people in the industry that
you have to be ready to produce at
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly less than you can produce
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of take that, the people that
haven't been able to produce in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the markets that have had a shift or a
significant shift in costs are not in
[SPEAKER_00]: business anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that scale's key, and I think
greenhouse growing is one way that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: scale and stay competitive in the cannabis
industry, if you're a producer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would add to that, too,
that there's no question that the scaling
[SPEAKER_03]: is coming, especially as the big ag
companies are coming to the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also think that most of us who love
the plant, we think like artisan
[SPEAKER_03]: producers, and while we definitely need to
get a lot of the tricks of the trade from
[SPEAKER_03]: folks that we can, from scaling,
to use in our artisan grows, I also think
[SPEAKER_03]: that we, as both business owners,
but also as a cannabis scene, need to
[SPEAKER_03]: search our hearts and figure out how much
we want to support scaling, because a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of these companies are going to be
producing huge fields of flavorless
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers that are going to be the Budweiser
of cannabis, and then there's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: people who are doing craft at smaller
levels, but their skills have got to turn
[SPEAKER_03]: to specialty marketing, and so that their
products are set apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I agree with you on the scaling,
but I also think that we each need to
[SPEAKER_03]: decide for ourselves how far we want to go
down that path.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all need to grow some tomatoes just
so that we know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they're growing cannabis,
we'll have tomato cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I add to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Fort Collins, Colorado,
and there's a lot of breweries in Fort
[SPEAKER_00]: Collins, Colorado, and New Belgium Brewery
is one of those, and we kind of modeled
[SPEAKER_00]: our company, Man with Microbes,
over some of the culture and values that
[SPEAKER_00]: New Belgium did, and they're really known
to be company-owned and these really
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful properties internally,
and that's how we modeled our company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're a company, our employees own the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has shares, and I think that's a
really cool thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm a research scientist going to a
business guy, I don't really care about
[SPEAKER_00]: business structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to do things cool,
and that's some of the things that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And New Belgium Brewery is right around
the corner from our facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having a conversation with one of
the folks, kind of higher up in that
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, and they're really
struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, and it was a really well-known
craft brewery, Fat Tire, and they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of different brands, and they do a
wonderful job branding, and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: great products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened is they were dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the largest microbrewer
operation in the world, and they still
[SPEAKER_00]: are, and they're suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason they're suffering is because at
one point they're competing against
[SPEAKER_00]: Budweiser and Coors and all those major
breweries, and they distinguished
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves because they weren't that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the craft versus just the
producers that are growing flavorless
[SPEAKER_00]: flour, and I agree with that, and I think
there's always going to be a demand for
[SPEAKER_00]: craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happened to New Belgium Brewery
is Budweiser acknowledged that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they started buying up craft
breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, although New Belgium thought they
would have a brand loyalty, after a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: years people got amnesia, and they're
buying these craft breweries that are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually owned by Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's this strategic shift from
the large breweries to also be a craft
[SPEAKER_00]: brewery, and I think it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I heard that, I was like,
huh, there's a potential for that to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty keen on having small craft
breweries and small family or
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-family-owned businesses be a huge part
of the cannabis industry, and we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: small company ourselves, and so I'm keen
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's important to look at the
dynamics of other industries to see where
[SPEAKER_00]: that trend might be, so if you know where
the puck's going, you can kind of position
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself to protect yourself from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we make a mistake looking just
at the alcohol industry as, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's so comparable because they both hit
you high.
[SPEAKER_06]: My father was in the butter business,
and then Marjoram came along because some
[SPEAKER_06]: guy wrote an article that said,
you know, butter fat's bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: It turned out to be false.
[SPEAKER_06]: False news and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's rolling over in his grave today now
that we know that it was all bunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he was in the butter business,
so he came out with a little Marjoram,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and he had his Marjoram going
along, but his was a craft butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he stuck with it, and then he started
private labeling, you know, and things
[SPEAKER_06]: like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are ways you can keep alive and
do it, and I think that's a much better
[SPEAKER_06]: analogy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, as local people, you're going to
need to start co-opping together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's going to have to be the packer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's going to be the grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's going to be this, you know,
we need to start being crafty about being
[SPEAKER_06]: craft businesses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think we're thinking together
quite yet, but it'll happen as soon as,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, Budweiser gets into the
business, and it's not going to be very
[SPEAKER_06]: long, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to weigh in on that,
Peter?
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a question over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have questions now or again?
[SPEAKER_03]: We may or may not have time for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but Peter, if you, we're not going to,
continue on, I was actually going to shift
[SPEAKER_03]: to questions now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did you want to weigh in on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go ahead, and then we'll move to
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so this thread that you're pulling
about size of operation and Colin's
[SPEAKER_05]: reality check on scaling is very dear to
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried to spend my career as a
researcher conducting research to help my
[SPEAKER_05]: fellow growers who are small and medium in
size.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think part of the story that Colin
shared with New Belgium is, and I've
[SPEAKER_05]: experienced it on the commercial
greenhouse side, when you end up too big
[SPEAKER_05]: to be small and too small to be big and
get caught in that middle area,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm very passionate over my lifetime
as a commercial greenhouse operator.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've often asked the question,
why is it in this country that the only
[SPEAKER_05]: measure of success is how big you are?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I could change that and create an
environment where you can be small and
[SPEAKER_05]: successful, that's my passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the torch I try to carry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we walk the path in commercial
greenhouses with ornamental crops and
[SPEAKER_05]: bedding plants and whatnot, where big
greenhouse operations fuel the mass
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my family's operation as a small
family garden center, we survived from
[SPEAKER_05]: this 1960 to 2010.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as the recession took hold,
we were always able to charge more than
[SPEAKER_05]: the mass market.
[SPEAKER_05]: But during the recession, we couldn't
charge enough to stay in business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we closed our doors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very passionate about your industry
being able to hold on to some success in
[SPEAKER_05]: being small.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, just to finish up the comment two
weeks ago, I heard that two of our top 100
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse operations, top 100 in the
country in size, acreage, are closing
[SPEAKER_05]: their doors and selling out for hemp
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: I turned to my wife and I said,
great, those big greenhouses put me out of
[SPEAKER_05]: business as a small family-run garden
center.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, they get what they, full circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they're going out of business and
selling out to a new crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is gonna be a problem for the little
guy, because the hemp stuff, the pollen
[SPEAKER_06]: gets into your crops and that's not good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's all a big, terrible circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got time for a couple questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you go ahead first?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a couple months ago, there was a study
published by a group out of Berkeley that
[SPEAKER_02]: they genetically modified a host of yeast
cells to produce cannabinoids such as THC
[SPEAKER_02]: and CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So piggybacking off of Colin's statement
about scale, do you really think these
[SPEAKER_02]: Budweiser's and Marlboro's of the cannabis
future are gonna be growing plants or are
[SPEAKER_02]: they just gonna be brewing giant fats and
this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that study and I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be fair, I'm not sure exactly the
state of that technology, but it's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that they still have a little
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's gonna be a place for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about the farm industry,
the farm industry's not gonna wanna manage
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses and grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna wanna make stuff in
fermenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I think as a consumer of cannabis is
gonna want to take it, consume from a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid that's extracted from a yeast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would assume no, but I'll tell
you what, if it's made into a pill.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what that statistic is on
pill consumption in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's extremely high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's gonna be a market for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's gonna be the market
that we acknowledge as a cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a medical market there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you have Crohn's, some terrible
intestinal disease and you can take a
[SPEAKER_06]: yeast based pill that'll release THC in
your intestines in an anaerobic
[SPEAKER_06]: environment, wow, pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That might make a tremendous amount of
sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to smoke the stuff?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some people put yeast on popcorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love yeast on popcorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have this idea having been in
horticulture not related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of industry groups that market
together, that work together, that produce
[SPEAKER_01]: research together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't see a whole lot of that
happening in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about that as being sort
of a model for how the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: could move forward with research,
protecting its brands, its artisan
[SPEAKER_01]: qualities, that kind of stuff?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're beginning to see it, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: In places like the Emerald Triangle,
here we have Clean Green certified.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are marketing co-ops in lots of
different places.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is it's been illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And still, there's no banking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody's worried that if they make
the wrong move marketing wise,
[SPEAKER_06]: the government comes down and says,
ooh, God, it's good thing Jeff Sessions
[SPEAKER_06]: isn't around, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are some that are there already.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I can speak for Colin and myself,
both being tied to the academic community.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got colleagues around the country
salivating for the federal law to change
[SPEAKER_05]: so that all of these university programs,
land grant universities, can get involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have friends all around the country who
are salivating as well when they're not in
[SPEAKER_03]: academics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard enough because at the moment,
you're not even supposed to be sending
[SPEAKER_03]: samples back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard to even develop labs and such
when you're not supposed to be shipping
[SPEAKER_03]: your samples.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and if you're only allowed to grow
six plants, for example, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's not an experiment, period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, unfortunately, we have reached the
end of our time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we need to make room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put your hands together for Peter Cunn,
Joanne, Jeff Lohanfeld, and Colin Bell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jango and Angelico.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
