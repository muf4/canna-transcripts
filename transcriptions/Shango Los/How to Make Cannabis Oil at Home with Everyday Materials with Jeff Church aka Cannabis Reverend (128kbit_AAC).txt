[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight's demo is from Jeff Church,
also known globally as cannabis reverend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff has mastered every modern extraction
technique and most of the ancient ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has traveled the world to both learn
exotic techniques as well as spread modern
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques from the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a long time patient advocate from
way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been in the front of the laws
helping humans get relief since the very
[SPEAKER_00]: early days here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff is presently an extractor and hash
maker at 502 Processor Puffin Farms and he
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to consult everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff is absolutely one of my mentors but
even more so I'm really honored to call
[SPEAKER_00]: him a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please welcome Jeff Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for coming tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome to see such a huge crowd here
and just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tonight we've got ethanol hash oil on
the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know a lot of you guys call it
ethanol hash oil, a lot of people call it
[SPEAKER_01]: full extract cannabis oil, Biko,
RSO, there's a lot of different names but
[SPEAKER_01]: basically what it boils down to is the
best method for the extraction and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol and so that's why I prefer to call
it ethanol hash oil rather than Brick
[SPEAKER_01]: Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brick Simpson is a great guy, definitely
helped a lot of people find this oil but
[SPEAKER_01]: it has nothing to do with him at this
point you know and so kind of that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: I've drawn the line a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tonight we'll make ethanol or I'll
describe how to make ethanol hash oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a flammable solvent so we're not
going to actually perform the extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: here tonight but I'll go through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically there's a few different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biko, a lot of people refer to that as a
full extract cannabis oil right so it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: full plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take every part of the plant,
some people even the roots of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and they take that and they do an ethanol
extraction on it and you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people do a warm long soak so 24 hours or
longer from some people and you end up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a really green extract that's full of
every constituent that's in the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: so for a lot of people that is the
medicine, that's what they want,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what they're after.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me personally I just really love,
I love extracting the resin of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I'm not as into all of the other
constituents that are in the plant so as
[SPEAKER_01]: you know like chlorophyll I'm not really
interested in having that in something but
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke you know so I'm more into this
quick kind of whole extraction method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you've got Biko, you've got
quick wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick wash is kind of like a way to make a
really nice hash oil at home without
[SPEAKER_01]: having to use butane you know you can do
rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin is a great method as well to make
hash oil but if you want to use a solvent
[SPEAKER_01]: you can take isopropyl alcohol is what
people used to use and I don't recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: that anymore but they had a quick iso
method, quizzo is what people would call
[SPEAKER_01]: it and you can do the same thing with
ethanol with 95% ethanol and do a quick
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction and get something that's going
to be nice for smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to have much of the green
in there at all but you know that's one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that people do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people do this full extract campus oil
that's really everything that's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant extracted into the oil or you can do
way on the other end this really quick
[SPEAKER_01]: wash that's just going to get the resin
heads of the plant and it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: contain everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also long soaks on flowers you can
do any number of things under the Sun you
[SPEAKER_01]: know with ethanol which makes it a really
versatile and really easy to kind of hone
[SPEAKER_01]: in what process you want to based on what
your final product is going to be what
[SPEAKER_01]: your final product is that you desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you need to make ethanol hash oil
at home is really simple you need some
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol and so this right here is
everclear it's 95% alcohol you need a you
[SPEAKER_01]: need cannabis of course you need a jar to
do the extraction you need a coffee filter
[SPEAKER_01]: for doing a filtration some form of you
know a press really works well so this is
[SPEAKER_01]: a potato racer you can dump the cannabis
right in there and press out the last bits
[SPEAKER_01]: of the ethanol and you need somewhere to
store it you know a syringe works really
[SPEAKER_01]: well for ethanol it's nice for dosing you
can kind of see where what amount you're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually using and then a method of
cooking the ethanol off and a method of
[SPEAKER_01]: decarbonate so for cooking the ethanol off
what we've gone to is a rice cooker and so
[SPEAKER_01]: the rice cooker really is that perfect
tool for you can run an extension cord
[SPEAKER_01]: outside because none of this should ever
be done inside when you're cooking on
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent it's a very dangerous thing you
guys are going to burn down your house if
[SPEAKER_01]: you do it in your kitchen eventually you
know so you know it's alcohol it's less
[SPEAKER_01]: flammable than doing butane extraction in
your kitchen but still it's not something
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want to do so you can run your
extension cord out you can set this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: up and the beauty about the rice cooker is
you're not going to scorch your oil
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's going to turn off before it's
done you know this this is meant to boil
[SPEAKER_01]: water so it's going to get quite hot you
know possibly up to 300 degrees but when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got a it's got a sensor in there
that'll tell that the temperature is
[SPEAKER_01]: spiked and it'll shut it off so the switch
gets thrown so what I go for when I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing an ethanol extraction at home is I
really want just beautiful golden tincture
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you guys can come and see this
later so this is what I made at home just
[SPEAKER_01]: in preparation for this class so what I
like to do is freeze the material and the
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol overnight so I like a deep freezer
because it's colder than my you know
[SPEAKER_01]: freezer that I've got with all the rest of
my food at home the deep freezer gets that
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol to that perfect temperature where
you can definitely still pour it it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: syrup there it's not like really slushy
you know which if you use like dry ice to
[SPEAKER_01]: chill it you can kind of get into that
slushy kind of territory and so you put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in there overnight then you take and pour
your ethanol over your cannabis and I
[SPEAKER_01]: prefer not to grind it I don't want the
green that's inside of it all of the resin
[SPEAKER_01]: is on the health side of the plant
material and the ethanol is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: saturate through it in the extraction
period that I'm doing if I ground it my
[SPEAKER_01]: yield would probably be a little bit
better but better of what?
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be full of other constituents
that are inside the cell walls when when
[SPEAKER_01]: you break the plant material you're
extracting what's exposed and so it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: really what I'm aiming for some people
really like to have that green hash oil
[SPEAKER_01]: for for eating and you know that's that's
a great method you would definitely want
[SPEAKER_01]: to grind it if that was the case just
using buds right just using buds yeah so I
[SPEAKER_01]: used flowers for this they were actually
some old flowers that I just happened to
[SPEAKER_01]: have around so it was a perfect extraction
material so you pour the ethanol over the
[SPEAKER_01]: material and put it right back into the
freezer and let it soak for three hours
[SPEAKER_01]: and so that's kind of the quick extraction
time frame that you can get into in the
[SPEAKER_01]: deep freeze and not have to worry about I
could probably extend that to five hours
[SPEAKER_01]: if I really want to and I have to worry
about too much chlorophyll being extracted
[SPEAKER_01]: but three hours I just really like that
number it seems to always work well for me
[SPEAKER_01]: people on the other hand definitely will
go for a 24-hour or even one month long
[SPEAKER_01]: soaks if they're really trying to fully
digest every last bit of what is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant but to each their own you
know I really love hash each like I said
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm more on the resin side of it rather
than the plant material side of it sure
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah we will talk about decarb I didn't
decarb so yeah there's definitely you know
[SPEAKER_01]: if you decarb some people say it's easier
to perform the extraction you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_01]: a more complete extraction I feel like
ethanol such a great solvent that it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of what I'm going after
anyway so I don't think it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary to decarb it and I really like a
acid form tincture and so in the acid form
[SPEAKER_01]: tincture you're going to have all of your
terpene content there if you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: decarb your material for the extraction so
that's one thing to think about so is your
[SPEAKER_01]: goal to smoke or to eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: it's to have a versatile oil that you
could use for it's going to be high in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids so this stuff here was decarb
so with the intention of eating but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very smokeable so yeah it's something and
you know it could have more terpenes in it
[SPEAKER_01]: if I didn't decarb it it would have tasted
a lot better I could have gone with a more
[SPEAKER_01]: gentle approach to it but I went and put
some heat on there and made sure that it
[SPEAKER_01]: decarb so you know that what most people
are looking for an ethanol hash oil for at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point is to eat you know a lot of
people are after the RSO or the FECO for a
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer regimen you know and so that's
that's really you know where they go but
[SPEAKER_01]: you can definitely make that with a quick
extraction you don't have to have all
[SPEAKER_01]: those other constituents in there they may
play key roles to have to you know to the
[SPEAKER_01]: healing but the cannabinoids themselves as
well all been shown to help cancer you
[SPEAKER_01]: know so it's kind of I'm not sure what
part of the plant really is healing us I
[SPEAKER_01]: just know that it's healing us okay so the
point of freezing the ethanol before is to
[SPEAKER_01]: lower the temperature of extraction so the
plant material is frozen the ethanol is
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen then when you combine the two
certain constituents aren't dissolvable
[SPEAKER_01]: like chlorophyll chlorophyll is not
dissolvable at freezing temperature or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not as readily dissolved so over time
you're still going to get chlorophyll to
[SPEAKER_01]: extract if you leave it in the freezer for
long enough but but starting cold allows
[SPEAKER_01]: you not to have these undesired
constituents that come over yes so please
[SPEAKER_01]: hold your questions at the end Jeff's got
a lot to get through right now so hold the
[SPEAKER_01]: questions right now we'll definitely talk
questions at the end here sure so freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: the material for three hours and then what
I like to do is just a simple coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: filter I put it into the jar and then I
fold over most of it but leave just a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit on unattached there so there's
there's an airflow so there's there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: space for airflow in here so then then you
just take your your cannabis and and
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol and you pour it right on over over
it and then I'll take after everything's
[SPEAKER_01]: poured out of it I take and put the the
plant material in here and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to squeeze right here like this and
one prop that I didn't bring tonight is a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice two cup measuring cup glass measuring
cup and you can just kind of set it on
[SPEAKER_01]: there and get your squeeze going and not
really lose anything and then pour that
[SPEAKER_01]: into the cup break through the filter and
so this right here is the filtered extract
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys can all at the end of the event
come up here open it up and smell if you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like to you can actually smell some of the
turkeys it's really heavy with alcohol so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard to smell but and then this is
this is the final oil over here the wash
[SPEAKER_01]: but so you take this after it's filtered
and you put it into the rice cooker flip
[SPEAKER_01]: the switch on and within about a half an
hour with the lid on all of the ethanol
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part most of the ethanol I
should say is gone and it still has quite
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit of turkeys in there there's a little
bit left it's not very well de-carved at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point so at that point you have a
couple options if you just have the rice
[SPEAKER_01]: cooker you can take and push down on this
switch a little bit and it'll pop right
[SPEAKER_01]: back up so just hold it for like two
seconds and then let it back up and then
[SPEAKER_01]: do it again and repeat until you start to
see the oil form little bubbles and so
[SPEAKER_01]: when it forms little bubbles you stop as
the boiling starts to slow back down you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do that process again and then
continue that until the boiling has
[SPEAKER_01]: finished and that's that's an easy way to
decarb it's not the most elegant it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to destroy some of the THC in your
extract but it's going to get you a decarb
[SPEAKER_01]: product without having to go through a lot
of extra hassle so if you're if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just trying to make it a quick easy
extract you can go there if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: take it one step further you can have a
pot on a hot plate with oil in it and you
[SPEAKER_01]: heat that oil up use a candy thermometer
to 250 260 degrees somewhere in that range
[SPEAKER_01]: and you take your oil out of the rice
cooker and pour it into a jar while it's
[SPEAKER_01]: still warm so it's easy to get out of
there and then set it in this in the pot
[SPEAKER_01]: of oil and decarb it that way and so
that's going to take you know anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: from 20 minutes if you've got just a very
small amount of oil 20 minutes from the
[SPEAKER_01]: time the oil reaches that 250 260 degrees
so it'll take a few minutes for it to warm
[SPEAKER_01]: up up to a couple hours if you have a
large amount of oil there for it to decarb
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can watch it boil and what's
boiling off is ethanol terpenes and carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: dioxide so when the carboxylic acid is is
broken by the heat the THC acid turns into
[SPEAKER_01]: THC Delta 9 and so that's that's kind of
you know the decarb process and during
[SPEAKER_01]: that process co2 is produced so it's just
it's broken off and you know that when the
[SPEAKER_01]: slowing of the bubbling happens the
majority of your of your extract has been
[SPEAKER_01]: decarb or you have too little you know
you've got to watch that but in in this
[SPEAKER_01]: pot you'll know that your heat is is
pretty much right so then from there see
[SPEAKER_01]: so then from there you know you've got a
few different options you can put your
[SPEAKER_01]: extract into a jar it's gonna be really
hard when you try to get it out so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not the ideal container for it you know
you'd be warming up that jar and then
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to scoop a little bit out I really
like to pack it into syringes because they
[SPEAKER_01]: are kind of the easiest way to dose
something you know you can see how much
[SPEAKER_01]: you've just dispensed so you get an idea
of how much how many milligrams of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids you're getting into your
system if you have a rough idea of what
[SPEAKER_01]: your extract is which something by this
method is probably gonna be like a 60%
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid content at least if you do a
cold extraction and you can definitely get
[SPEAKER_01]: higher than that but if you soak it for
longer you're gonna get lower than that
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure and you know probably this long
one month soap would get you like a 30%
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what you're starting to your
list could be even more than that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really really bad starting material but
but yeah so I really like these syringes
[SPEAKER_01]: and and what you've been using is actually
glass on glass syringes and so the glass
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't react with any terpenes it's
not gonna be broken down so there's not
[SPEAKER_01]: much terpene content left in in decarbed
oil because you've cooked a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: off during the decarbed process but
there's definitely some left in there
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes are a solvents so packing it into
glass is much better than packing it into
[SPEAKER_01]: something that has any type of plastic you
know silicone and any type of plastic is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to absorb those terpenes and give
off plasticizers you probably don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be eating those you know I mean we eat
enough of them already with all the food
[SPEAKER_01]: that we eat that's packed in plastic so
probably best to stay away from it if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're making yourself medicine so that's
the the first way to do it is to pack it
[SPEAKER_01]: into a syringe or a jar and do it while
it's hot right out of the rice cooker or
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's already in a jar it's already in a
jar you're you're ready there right after
[SPEAKER_01]: the decarbed process is the easiest way
the oil is going to be so thick that when
[SPEAKER_01]: you get it into the syringe you literally
can't you know I push on the syringe and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no motion there at all so to
dispense out of these syringes you would
[SPEAKER_01]: just put it into a cup of hot water or run
it under the hot water in the sink and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's one way to get the pure pure
oil out another route that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: popular is to add some sort of a viscosity
agent one way or another so a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people use hemp seed oil MCT medium chain
triglycerides which is a fractionated
[SPEAKER_01]: coconut oil is a really popular one for
people to add and you can mix that in when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hot and then once you load it into
the syringes then you'll be able to squirt
[SPEAKER_01]: it right out of the syringe and eat it on
the go without having to heat it at all so
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll also help with the absorption
into your body so some people really like
[SPEAKER_01]: to eat the oil just raw without having
anything added to it some people like to
[SPEAKER_01]: have something added to it to help carry
it into the body and carry it out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: syringe yeah so I think that's that's
pretty much ethanol hash oil from cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: into the syringe it's really an easy
method of extraction so if you guys have
[SPEAKER_01]: some questions I'd love to answer yeah
sure definitely it depends on the purity
[SPEAKER_01]: of your teeth you know so it's all about
your starting material what what did you
[SPEAKER_01]: put in for cannabinoids you're gonna get
out a lesser amount because there's always
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be some left in your material but
that's pretty much what you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_01]: out yeah well okay so so it's really hard
to kind of nail that down I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's gonna be dependent on your
illness that you're trying to take it for
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really the big thing I know that a
very popular thing that people are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: is the 60 in 90 days so they'll try to get
60 grams of full extract cannabis oil in
[SPEAKER_01]: in 90 days and so you start off with a
grain of rice sized dose and that seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: be what pretty much everybody can tolerate
it might be a little bit much for for
[SPEAKER_01]: inexperienced users but a grain of rice
seems to be about right you could start
[SPEAKER_01]: with half that if you're really
inexperienced and then move your way up to
[SPEAKER_01]: a gram a day at the end of 90 days so
it'll take 60 grams to get you 90 days and
[SPEAKER_01]: that seems to be a popular treatment I'm
not a doctor so I really don't I can't say
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's what's been a purity but you
know but it seems to be a popular thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that people are claiming to have really
good success
[SPEAKER_01]: so I mean you can still take take material
down to a testing lab so if you made a
[SPEAKER_01]: batch of oil here in Washington State like
I'm pretty sure analytical 360 would test
[SPEAKER_01]: your oil for you so just go down to their
Seattle location or you know and they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll do it and then you'd know how many
milligrams are in how much and you'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to dose yourself by milligrams if you
want but most people don't have labs like
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know have access to that so we're
lucky here yes to respond to the first
[SPEAKER_06]: question about using keep in my experience
what advantage over using keep over flour
[SPEAKER_06]: you already have the trichomes and all of
this is a method of script mining what's
[SPEAKER_06]: on the outside when you use keep you don't
have plant material chlorophyll isn't such
[SPEAKER_06]: a big deal you get gold a lot easier and
there's less need to winterize because
[SPEAKER_06]: it's less fat to pull out all those waxes
you can do the extraction hot and not have
[SPEAKER_01]: to worry exactly as long as the key wasn't
too green right even smoke that the tops
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff but the rest of that stuff is
largely trichomes even broken drop the
[SPEAKER_06]: issue of a lot of chlorophyll and you can
be a little longer and warmer in your
[SPEAKER_06]: excuse me just cellulose left yeah you
give us a sliding scale on your yields at
[SPEAKER_01]: that three hour mark yeah so so what I got
here was probably two and a half grams
[SPEAKER_01]: from an ounce so you know it was a little
less than 10% on the yield when I make
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol hatch oil for 502 we're not using
flour we're using leaf and bottom buds
[SPEAKER_01]: right so it's like all the little little
pieces so like you know if I went to
[SPEAKER_01]: everything has its home you know so if if
it's good for this type of extraction we
[SPEAKER_01]: use it over there if it's not so this just
happens to be where everything goes there
[SPEAKER_01]: but we get about five percent yield and
we'll come up with about a sixty percent
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid content on the oil there as
well so and that's doing a cold extraction
[SPEAKER_03]: three hours as well how much how much
would you say your trim goes to this type
[SPEAKER_01]: of extraction pho well we're committing
quite a bit of it so pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: everything you know we've moved to
extracting flowers for all of our co2 oil
[SPEAKER_01]: we have sugar leaf to make bubble hash and
then pretty much everything else like all
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that are the small buds and the
rest of the not as resonance leaf but
[SPEAKER_01]: still you know as a tiny bit you know
there's this more shade leaf that all goes
[SPEAKER_01]: to it so a whole tier three is worth is
what we're processing into ethanol hash
[SPEAKER_01]: oil and so it's not out yet but it's
coming that's a whole nother story but
[SPEAKER_01]: winterize to take some of the greenery out
of it so winterization is happening with
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol and then in a cold environment so
we're doing ethanol in a cold environment
[SPEAKER_01]: and so the lipids that you would be
winterizing out of an extract that's a co2
[SPEAKER_01]: extract would not even come out because
they're gonna stay in the matrix they're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna stay locked in there because they're
the conditions for them to be dissolved
[SPEAKER_01]: are not there it's too cold and it's in
ethanol so ethanol doesn't you can't
[SPEAKER_05]: dissolve mostly lipids in ethanol so
you're looking at a 5% water content and
[SPEAKER_05]: that is all right right yeah I mean yeah I
don't know I wouldn't say that although
[SPEAKER_01]: like I think that you're gonna cut off
some of that water in your D cart process
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's that's really actually you know
a lot of people used to use water and as a
[SPEAKER_01]: buffer in their D cart so they toss some
in there and they would know because of
[SPEAKER_01]: how the water boiled out when it when it
was ready when it was D cart yeah so I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that if you're D carving it's not
not a big issue and I've never you know my
[SPEAKER_01]: co2 winterization I've never had an issue
with water except for from the co2 process
[SPEAKER_07]: you know we did extracts water so yes what
do you think of the method of D carving
[SPEAKER_07]: the bugs before you use them with the put
them in a mason jar so that the terpenes
[SPEAKER_07]: supposedly stay in there rather than doing
that after yeah I mean you know there's
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of different ways to do it and
that's another another thing that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could do you could take this tincture even
and set that into you know a hot bath
[SPEAKER_01]: right but then you're gonna have you know
closed environment with the solvent that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's boiling away and I just I feel like
you know that that could be dangerous in a
[SPEAKER_01]: home environment you know so it's not
something I was trying to recommend but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's totally possible in the terpenes if
you're aiming for an alcohol tincture
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than an RSO oil you could totally
retain the tincture or retain the terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: and have the tincture be activated but
you're going to change the terpenes from
[SPEAKER_01]: what they were on a flower to a degraded
version of that just like the THC is
[SPEAKER_01]: degrading down the terpenes are also going
to degrade down so you'll still be
[SPEAKER_06]: impressive so my advice my experience not
that I've done this illegally at home
[SPEAKER_06]: larger jar than the volume and you need to
periodically open and burp it because the
[SPEAKER_06]: solvent will vaporize and and you'll hear
the lid pop so you want to use a headspace
[SPEAKER_06]: by having volume above the liquid and burp
it when it pops yep and but then when you
[SPEAKER_01]: burp it, turps are flying out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand but it doesn't blow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you still save stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't blow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I mean it's going to force the
terpenes out right it's going to force
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol it's going to force terpenes out
and so you'll end up with a hash oil
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually if you had the lid off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now did I hear Susan's question right
though?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is she saying like decarbonize the flower
in a mason jar sealed prior to the oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right yeah so so I mean you can totally do
that as well decarbonize and then extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not done that specific way that
you're talking.
So yeah stuff continues.
I'd imagine that you really need to use
like two or three times the volume or five
times the volume of actually material that
you have.
I mean it's going to be like super thick
basically because you know if you've got a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain amount of solvent it's obviously
going to expand to all of the container
[SPEAKER_04]: it's in where it's heated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously a larger container would take
longer for that to all build up to a
[SPEAKER_04]: pressure that's actually dangerous so
probably definitely by bad thicker walls
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to wash an ounce of material
with ethanol from the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of everything do I want to use to
wash an ounce?
[SPEAKER_01]: About a pint would work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know your mileage may be a little
bit different but depending on how fluffy
[SPEAKER_01]: it is if you grind it down like I don't
suggest definitely be able to use less
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's totally fine to grind it
especially if you're just eating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not smoking it get the
cannabinoids out of the plant material and
[SPEAKER_01]: get it out in the most efficient way and
that would be saving you ethanol by
[SPEAKER_01]: grinding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget about the little bit of green
you're going to have in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your cost of production is lower if you
grind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No but it is a cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back on the heat subject can you go
into the ratios of starting material an
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce of heat to how much alcohol you'll
need to saturate that ounce?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah you know I mean I haven't really
recorded anything on heat extraction of
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol to like really know definitively.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just you know I would say that you're
probably going to need more ethanol than
[SPEAKER_01]: you would for a flower extraction right to
be able to get all the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's going to be a saturation
point with Keef.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just you know cover it till
like with flower that's all you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just cover the flower material make
sure that it's all in the in the alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've got the extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Keef if you just covered it that's
really not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to have a lot more
ethanol to perform that extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double it Jerry says.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to ask so many questions about
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're doing all the CO2 stripping
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing with that CO2 material?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you thinking about going EHL?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exactly what happens with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't perform the extraction myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what happens with the plant
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use every part of the plant that you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be something I've
actually Keef material after it was CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: extracted and tested the Keef and it was
20% DHC and so that's great ethanol at
[SPEAKER_01]: Hatchell extraction material.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree and I think that why I'm so
curious about it is that we did something
[SPEAKER_03]: similar in my brother's farm and he
processed back some waste and we got you
[SPEAKER_03]: know a one-to-one but like a high CBC high
kind of chromium profile which was quite
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting you know and we went through
medicine creek analytics so I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: if that's something where you want to go
and check the cannabinoid differences post
[SPEAKER_03]: strip and then maybe even the lower leaf
if you could like isolate the strain
[SPEAKER_03]: variants something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I would say that CBC would be in my
you know my knowledge it's an easier
[SPEAKER_01]: extracted constituent than THC acid and so
it's going to come over first in your CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what my experience is but I mean
you're saying kind of the opposite maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: The material could be CO2 or VHO.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure VHO could be totally different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure what the source material
was for that exact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah but we had a 20% CBC extract that was
a CO2 quick fraction that took off the
[SPEAKER_01]: very very beginning of the run really and
so it was yeah really really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 40% terpenes and 20% CBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously yeah so that was kind of you
know but that's not a product that's out
[SPEAKER_01]: on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you sterilize?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dricit sterilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know I ran into this issue with
break in the medical days and we had some
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash that tested positive for some
nasty microbes and so we were like oh my
[SPEAKER_01]: gosh what's going on here and so when you
do dry sip a lot of people do it cold and
[SPEAKER_01]: then this cold hash gets brought out and
it collects and condenses moisture from
[SPEAKER_01]: the atmosphere and you can actually have
some issues with dry sip having microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're doing VCO or you know ethanol
hash oil you don't have any worries about
[SPEAKER_01]: that as long as you perform the extraction
pretty quick because ethanol is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: kill any of those bacteria but if you're
pressing rosin from it it's an issue and
[SPEAKER_01]: so what we decided to do was we did a UVC
light treatment right out of the tumbler
[SPEAKER_01]: so the moment it came out of the freezer
came out of the tumbler we got that hash
[SPEAKER_01]: and we in thin layers did a UVC light
treatment to it and never had a microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: issue with it so it basically stopped any
of the microbes from being able to bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: into that heat so I don't know if that's
exactly what you're asking but there you
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have it in a nice contained
contraption basically like we built a box
[SPEAKER_01]: for a UVC light and then I actually had an
extension cord going way to the other end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the lab and did it because I believe
there's like ozone that's created there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some nasty kind of stuff that's created
when a UVC light burns so I always had it
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I had to switch over on the end
of the extension cord switched it off
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed it for it to sit there for a
little bit came by opened it up before I
[SPEAKER_01]: would do the stuff so I did take some
extra caution and yeah they sell them on
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon, Ebay, you can get them there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good time, push button, switch to the
usual lights at home people for $18 gives
[SPEAKER_05]: you three different loads put it on they
walk out of the room and push it because
[SPEAKER_05]: if it's not you don't have a site.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any more?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
You're welcome.
