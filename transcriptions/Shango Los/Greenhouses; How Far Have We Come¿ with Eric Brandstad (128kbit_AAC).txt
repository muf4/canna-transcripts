[SPEAKER_05]: Hey everybody, welcome to the 130
presentation on greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: How far have we come?
[SPEAKER_05]: Please silence your cell phones if you
haven't already all ready already.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm shango those host of the shaping fire
podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you like listening to smart interviews
with the top minds and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: I invite you to check out the show at
shaping fire.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we also had an extraordinary YouTube
channel with over 150 speaker videos I've
[SPEAKER_05]: recorded at events just like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one Eric's presentation from today
will be there next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, we probably got four or five
videos with Eric at this point talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about different aspects of greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: So make sure you check that out at shaping
fire.com and there are postcards in the
[SPEAKER_05]: back near the door while they last to help
you remember the name shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eric Branstad has been producing cannabis
on Northern California in Northern
[SPEAKER_05]: California for decades.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a nationally known greenhouse and
light depth expert.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking nearly everywhere now for almost
15 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is not, he is now founder of greenhouse
advisory group, helping commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivators choose placement, build,
and even rescue under producing
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's also a really good guy and a reliable
friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please welcome Eric Branstad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my phone away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I run the keynote, so I gotta have
my phone in order to run the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not checking my social medias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Shango for that nice
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good seeing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, a little bit about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, my family started farming in 1862
in California, not too far from
[SPEAKER_00]: Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they weren't into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was 18 years old, I left to go
to Humboldt County and, and kind of follow
[SPEAKER_00]: my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and the cannabis,
I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, I started learning a lot of
that right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot about cannabis right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, at that time for light deprivation,
it was called black boxing at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would take cardboard boxes and
individually, uh, black box each plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to create this photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old timers in the sixties,
late sixties going into the seventies used
[SPEAKER_00]: to black box all their small seedlings in
order to get them to sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so people have been black boxing
for photo period for one reason or
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, since the early seventies from a lot
of my research, um, I really got into the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse side of things for light
deprivation, um, greenhouses in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so basically we, I was with a
company called forever flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses and we pioneered the light
deprivation technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't necessarily invent it,
but we kind of made it available to the
[SPEAKER_00]: public and also spent a lot of time doing
research and development on how to best,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, work these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my presentation today isn't so much
on the technological side of how to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in the greenhouses because I've done that
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm basically kind of going to go over
where we, where we were, how we got there,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we've come, how far we're going,
those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a little bit of a history lesson
too, to kind of see why things we did are
[SPEAKER_00]: in place even today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of the reasons people went into
greenhouses primarily because prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: was starting to lighten up, especially in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with our quasi legal two 15,
um, greenhouses, especially up in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California were quite popular,
you know, mainly because of the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of times the weather was the
main concern for needing a greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't even used as a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people would put the skin on,
take the skin off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it rains, put it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, it's a nice day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it off type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it wasn't until later on where we
really started refining these light
[SPEAKER_00]: deprivation techniques and realizing that
we can use the greenhouse more year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really does make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though, because greenhouses were invented
for winter time, um, most people in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and hemp are all in for the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of an opposite way of
looking at things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you have these contraptions
that were intended for different seasons
[SPEAKER_00]: with these typical grow, you know,
these types of growers only want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: them when they're not necessarily intended
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course they have a lot of stumbling
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I like to say hostility that
comes along with it, just because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people go to the greenhouses, get too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and so the first thing that,
you know, people say they come from an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor background is we need a cooling
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're not all in Pueblo,
Colorado, where it's really hot and really
[SPEAKER_00]: dry or really dry even for that matter,
regardless of the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, California and the West coast is full
of places that are, um, high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the Emerald Triangle on a 90
degree day can have 40% relative humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the traditional cooling systems and
wet walls of greenhouses don't always work
[SPEAKER_00]: like they do in some of these drier
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so back in the day, we kind of had to
start out from this, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, grass root style, I guess you
could say, because we were also off the
[SPEAKER_00]: grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even today in California, there's a lot of
licensed farms that are off the grid and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they still use, uh, these types of
greenhouses right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the hoop house was really the
original or the first type of greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: that was used for pulling tarps to
actually pull the tarp over to create this
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so we didn't really, you know,
start out with automated everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and also with automated requires
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we had to really look at things
from a basic standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the hoop houses, um, you know,
these ones have some beds in them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there were also containers,
30 gallon grow bags were the most popular
[SPEAKER_00]: container for the majority of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you would say you can grow a
pretty big plant in a 30 gallon grow bag
[SPEAKER_00]: and we would move it in and move it out
the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 30 gallon grow bags would be on a
pallet so that we can move them in and
[SPEAKER_00]: move them out without actually having to
carry them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could call it rental company and rent a
tractor or a Bobcat for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have to buy a piece of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just rented, have it there,
pull the plants out, move the new plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time with the new plants,
we had four or five foot tall trees ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to go inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were able to be flowering the same
day as we moved out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that model changed a little bit
because of people trying to recycle their
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one thing everybody used to
throw their soil away, get new soil
[SPEAKER_00]: containers, you know, this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get into the beds, people are
saving their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not throwing the soil out every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, a lot of the growing
techniques have changed over the times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the main reasons was also the
plant counts in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were subjugated to plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some counties and places before we went
prop 64 recreational, we had some counties
[SPEAKER_00]: that did have some wannabe ordinances that
says, okay, you can grow 25 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow 60 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow 12 plants in these various
counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so of course you wanted to grow the
biggest plant possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they grew in 30 gallon grow
bags on a pallet to be able to move in and
[SPEAKER_00]: move out right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have no limited unlimited plant
counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still within a square footage,
but you can grow as many plants as you
[SPEAKER_00]: want in that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a lot more popular these days
for people to be growing really small
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hoop houses, like I said, had
different forms over the course of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those was the start of the
plywood in walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see a lot of today,
light depth greenhouses have solid end
[SPEAKER_00]: walls because they're keeping the light
out where the blackout system is because
[SPEAKER_00]: on the end walls where there's fans and
doors, it's really hard to automate a
[SPEAKER_00]: curtain right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all these different squares and
openings and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was much easier just to make the
end wall solid, but that came with
[SPEAKER_00]: problems too along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first hoop house that we did,
you know, we thought the plywood would be
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used the light traps over the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in that picture, the two
square, the two squares are the light
traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would keep the light from going
through, but we're able to still use the
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust fans and intakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years before that, we didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have light traps all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really had to know when to pull our
tarps and the weather around that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't always as easy as it is now as
far as breathability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so nonetheless, what happened was is
this greenhouse still had a hot pocket
[SPEAKER_00]: from the roll-up side walls up is a dead
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it doesn't matter if you open the
doors, turn on the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you turn on the fan, you actually
don't get one air exchange per minute
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've broken the seal of negative
pressure by rolling up the side or opening
[SPEAKER_00]: the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fan pulls from the closest point of no
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw right away a lot of people
running the hoop house is wrong because
[SPEAKER_00]: they constantly have the sides up with
these big, you know, electricity consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: fans running and they still were
struggling with the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically what we did for this
greenhouse at the time, because we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really know exactly what to do,
was right up here in this zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: we cut it out with a sawzall and made what
we called a trap flap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by opening both ends up at the top
right there, we didn't have air traps so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it would heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, greenhouses trap air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air that's trapped heats up and that
air has to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the fans don't get rid of it,
we have to avoid it naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by not trapping the air,
it didn't heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the number one goal was to
avoid the greenhouse effect in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did that with the plywood end
walls and then it went a little further.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next 2.0 wasn't this one actually,
that's a nice little picture, was this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doors go from the ground all the way
to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by having the doors go from the
ground to the ceiling, we now have the
[SPEAKER_00]: door and we have the vent at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people with the hoop
houses go with the passive ventilation
[SPEAKER_00]: because of being off the grid or limited
amount of power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're in California, you don't just
get power all the time anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shut it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, having the sides rolled up
and having both ends open from the top to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom took away the greenhouse
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We avoided the solar game, which was the
important part of the greenhouse growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't need it to be a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't walk outside on 100 degree day
going, we need it to be 130.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just isn't the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so avoiding the solar game in the
greenhouse was crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next step was having the
greenhouse covered through the workforce.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get through the hoop houses,
we'll see some cool, here's some artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started adding some artwork to
their greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody guess what strain that was
reflecting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple punch, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: See the cookie over there knocked out,
the banana over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But purple punch didn't end up being as
punchy as we hoped.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 40 acre hoop house farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, people do scale up with hoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people go, well, hoops are for
little basic cottage or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are considered berry hoops,
but they're already existing in Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbara County.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see, it's tough to see,
they're full of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's 40 acres of cannabis growing
in hoop houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is some scalability to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it does require a lot more
labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about the light depth
technique, a lot of people are familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with it nowadays from the more automated
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in the day when we first started
pulling tarps, it was with ropes and
[SPEAKER_00]: standing on ladders and doing some crazy
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really what they would do is have a
piece of plastic laying on the side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse with some ropes attached to
that piece of plastic and then some tennis
[SPEAKER_00]: balls at the end of the rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they do is stand on one side
of the greenhouse, throw the tennis balls
[SPEAKER_00]: over the greenhouse, and then go to the
other side and grab the ropes to pull them
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what that would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also what it looks like when it
fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that facility has 10 of those
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine the labor involved in
10 greenhouses on a licensed facility kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over the course of time,
we see a lot of people have to cut corners
[SPEAKER_00]: or chew the fat in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of different ways to
chew the fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this wouldn't be one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a greenhouse facility recently,
new construction and a way to save a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of bucks as they didn't get the
light depth system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a lot of ways, you can get by
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're trying to create flowers
throughout the summer, you need the
[SPEAKER_00]: curtain system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so saving some money right there isn't
really making any sense because you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going to be able to get to your
goal at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has been a lack of planning over
the course of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do run into some things here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a simple hoop house that's up in
Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it has is a manual depth system
on the inside that was rigged up by a
[SPEAKER_00]: handy greenhouse installer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so along the way, we do find
resourceful things that actually are kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the same concept of what we used to
use, but really bringing it into the next
[SPEAKER_00]: level, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having a manual interior depth
system is really important because of
[SPEAKER_00]: weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the manual depth systems are from
the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the outside comes with a lot of
exposure and problems as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them aren't as easy to permit in
some counties as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in California, at least,
and I believe in some other states,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in California, we have greenhouse
rules and we have what's called hoop house
[SPEAKER_00]: rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's code and non-code.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in some counties, for instance,
you might be able to build a 20 by 48
[SPEAKER_00]: under 1,000 square foot greenhouse with no
electricity and it can be exempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a building permit,
but it's legal to grow cannabis in.
[SPEAKER_00]: No electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't put fans or lights or
anything in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost like an outdoor grow with a
little protection or a little ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: do some light depth or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people look for those ways
around things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people will put 10 to 14 under
1,000 square foot hoop houses all over
[SPEAKER_00]: their property to get to their tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 square foot license, which seems
kind of crazy and a lot of work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, especially in the
Emerald Triangle, that's all there was to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step that we got into were the
Gothic frames.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually was lucky enough to sell one of
the first greenhouses in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, which was one of these Gothics
before it really turned into Pueblo back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had sold one of these greenhouses to a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were kind of the first on scene
for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Pueblo has really turned into the
megastructures now versus a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it was many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just another side view of the
Gothic frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gothic frame is a little bit like I'd
like to call mid-tech compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower tech of the hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be more engineered to be
permitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can also have the interior
automated light depth system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also can be engineered to handle more
snow and wind than hoop houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's also hoop house rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the guidelines for the hoop house
rules is that you take the skin off in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in Trinity County or even
Humboldt for that matter, they recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: or make it a rule even that you take the
skin off so that if it snows, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of it collapsing or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to grow year round and not
take the skin off, then you jump to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next bracket of greenhouse, which would be
possibly the Gothic-shaped frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a Gothic frame that's 144 feet
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the single structures got to be really
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also the gutter-connected
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gutter-connected Gothic frames also
are kind of the mid-tech of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gutter-connectable greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically come in a four and a six
foot on center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can't go everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also make good places to give
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of classes inside these
greenhouses because we didn't grow in one
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a demo greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it actually provided us a great
classroom if we did it in the spring and
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall because it would get too hot or
too cold to cram everybody in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first like-deb greenhouse
that we ever did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did this with a company called
Agritech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agritech worked with us many years ago
when no other greenhouse companies would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we've really
come a long way with as far as it took
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization for greenhouse companies to
even recognize us, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many years ago, there was only a
select few greenhouse companies that would
[SPEAKER_00]: even mess with the suppliers of cannabis
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we couldn't really get the things that
we needed or learn some of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we wanted to learn because there was just
so much differences between cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-cannabis related businesses and
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once we did get this like-deb
system installed and done, it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: became the fuse for all the other
greenhouse companies to copy and to use
[SPEAKER_00]: and to basically mimic, I guess you could
say, we were the first company to use a
[SPEAKER_00]: triple layer breathable blackout material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most companies were using single layer for
whatever other crops they use for light
[SPEAKER_00]: deprivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other crops might be poinsettias,
most commonly people know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the forestry service uses them to put
pine trees into dormancy to make seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different reasons,
but they all use one layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're finding that two layers is okay
because we're using light meters to
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify how much light there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going, oh bro, I see a light
leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we're actually able to use
things and go, okay, yeah, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: light here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by doing that, we've actually saved
a couple of bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from the suppliers, what they told
me is that most of Canada is a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent double layer and America's 50-50
on the double to triple layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it does save a couple of bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what it looks like with an exterior
deprivation system on the outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's closing a little bit, but you can see
that it does cast quite a bit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so interior systems are really better
to work with in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, you know,
the cost is what really drove people to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into some of the exterior ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, once it falls apart or becomes
non-code when compliance comes in,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no savings there either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is considered a rack and
pinion system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty standard in all the
greenhouses with all the companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that we even invented the
rack and pinion system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greenhouse companies already utilize
these and we just added our, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: specific curtains and special flashings
and corners and seals and things that they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't originally have before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what some cannabis growing
inside of a gothic looks like in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the second and third
place winner of the Emerald Cup right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget the name of the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes by Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody calls him Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his strain is called this is the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an abbreviation, but I don't
really use the abbreviation because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: offensive sometimes to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, there's a lot of fans in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great greenhouse for Grandpa for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get into the A-frame
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a few different A-frames,
but nevertheless, most greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers have a hoop house,
have a gothic, and have an A-frame choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's inside with the rolling
benches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones were next gen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's another agritech greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's actually, I like this one a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impressive to me because it's not
using exhaust fans and intakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a passively ventilated A-frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people kind of are on the
fence between mechanical ventilation,
[SPEAKER_00]: passive ventilation, which is better,
negative pressure, positive pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go over all that stuff later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But using a passively ventilated large
scale greenhouse like this, I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the ridge vents, sides roll up,
the ends roll up, and it's only using
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation fans on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really dig that greenhouse a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This greenhouse is a grotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have any fans yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still under construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these A-frames are configured in so
many different ways that it really makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of user friendly in the sense that
you can pretty much get what you want into
[SPEAKER_00]: one mega facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference with this one compared to
the others, even though it's an A-frame,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it's positive pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't be able to see that from the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the noteworthy part of this picture is
the airlock right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drive into that chamber with a piece
of equipment or a forklift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually is an airlock before you
enter the rest of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really great for contamination
purposes and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other industries have bigger problems than
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they go to great measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we can go to those,
it's maybe, I don't know, we can talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about whether it's necessary all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are all kinds of, like I said,
extraordinary measures you can go to to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to prevent bugs and pathogens and
other things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what it looks like inside that same
greenhouse with those big ducting tubes
[SPEAKER_00]: going across the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you that aren't familiar
with negative and positive pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: negative pressure is with the exhaust fans
at one end, intakes at the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air gets pulled through the greenhouse
and out the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is positive pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're turning the fans around and
blowing the air in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it can be fresh air or can recycle
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to know about positive pressure
greenhouses is that not all companies do
[SPEAKER_00]: them the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's always good to work with a
reputable company that really knows what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing when you're doing positive
pressure anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a negative pressure greenhouse,
but it's also got a corridor down the
[SPEAKER_00]: center, a little different than the one
that I showed at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: A-frames.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there's a lot of ways to do
these greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses with these corridors,
head houses and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another A-frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more outfitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting into flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's go time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another A-frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually it's a gothic, but it looks like
an A-frame because on the inside it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: huge and vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of existing greenhouses
in the Salinas Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike Pueblo, Colorado where it's all
new construction, California had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: existing greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all those existing greenhouses
needed a tremendous amount of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so between Santa Barbara County and
Salinas Valley and Monterey County,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just a lot of berry hoops,
existing A-frames, gothic frames,
[SPEAKER_00]: big gutter connected structures and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were for other industries like
cut flowers and vegetable startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they do come with this degree of
retrofit that is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people don't know what the
metric is for where do we begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know where to begin, but they don't
know where to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we don't know necessarily
what it takes or people have this other
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that if we go this far, we'll grow
the best cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times we go so far that we
spend so much money that it's really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to crawl out of these holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always look at the retrofits as a
great way to get into something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, if you're not
practical and have good planning of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to retrofit at what specific time
in order to get some crops going and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: return, it can actually be a huge money
drain, even though it looked like a great
[SPEAKER_00]: investment at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting up new greenhouses can be pretty
expensive, but also, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: these retrofits can go pretty haywire too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people where they move in,
lose their ass, another person moves in,
[SPEAKER_00]: they lose their ass, and the third person
moves in and it's like, oh, we're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these greenhouses are leased
too, so the landowner is really the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming out ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some glass structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think that the glass
structures might be the leapfrog to
[SPEAKER_00]: greatness, but it's not necessarily true
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of debate out there between
glass and polycarbonates with the clear
[SPEAKER_00]: and the diffused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have been around cannabis my
whole life, like I was saying earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: since I was 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just see a lot more than THC and
just CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the cannabinoids, the amount of
cannabinoids there are, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, are really important to make a
full spectrum or a complete medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times we can get down the
road of chasing THC or even chasing CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new thing is CBG, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people will say,
we only get these characteristics if we
[SPEAKER_00]: grow certain ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we're ready to lump
everybody into that category yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just not enough research out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research that I've been doing with
labs has been showing a lot of times that
[SPEAKER_00]: overexposure causes plants to overheat,
sweat, and actually lose some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: production, whereas a supported plant
actually living to its fullest potential
[SPEAKER_00]: can give us more benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, like I said, a lot of people will
like the controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for a more supportive
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The controlled world really gets kind of
used a little bit crazy in this idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna control things to the degree
of the planet makes no choices on its own
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times the plant is what
dictates everything, and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily us.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the tests that I did with a lab was
doing some OG Kush that typically is a
[SPEAKER_00]: high THC, and we did it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was, of course, high THC,
but under the greenhouse covers that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were experimenting with, especially the
diffuse, we had 7% CBD in an OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was pretty ironic to see the full
sun not develop some of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics that the more supported
plant was in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields are a little different,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can go back and forth, but again,
glass a lot of times was really great for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the Dutch cut flower and things
like that, but their plants act a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: different than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they'll say a plant is a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant is a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep saying those kind of things,
but it's not necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the other plants don't have all
these terpenes and cannanoids that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to procure in the first place and
maybe extract and save for later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you can take cannabis and dry
it out too much and lose the smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't bring it back a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it turns to hay, it's hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do that in the growing process,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take just the drying process to
screw things up, and so it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hand-in-hand process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over the course of time,
you know, we learned also that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this was a big deal in
California and actually a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the headlines and see the recalls in
different states and places like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cannabis doesn't let you slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a dynamic and
bio-accumulator, it's going to clean up
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil and the air around it and any of
the little sneaky things that people try
[SPEAKER_00]: to pull in to maybe save the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, because cannabis is heavily
tested and regulated, we can see all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are starting to do their
due diligence on the smokable flower for
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp to see if they have heavy metals and
certain contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I mean, I don't see a lot of tests
out there on the smokable flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it makes me nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because, like I said, we had a tough
time in California keeping it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it isn't just the farming practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drift is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the end of the day,
when you go to some of these valleys in
[SPEAKER_00]: Salinas and Monterey County surrounded by
strawberries, grapes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuces and things that are being
sprayed, it's not uncommon to pop for some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up north, a lot of people were popping for
lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like the elephant in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do the heavy metals come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of minerals and
micronutrients can have heavy metals in
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, you know, chicken bedding has arsenic
in it, and so organic chicken manure
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden hoses that have, you know,
made from different countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're not real rubber hoses,
they actually have little warning signs
[SPEAKER_00]: that say don't drink out of the hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is the stuff that,
you know, really contributes a lot to this
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination level that we're running
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant material passes a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see plant materials pass all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that to concentration, and that's
where we find all the goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily for most people, remediation does
exist, but, you know, now we're relying on
[SPEAKER_00]: our extractors to make sure that they do
the right job and get us the return that
[SPEAKER_00]: we need and don't go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost a lot on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hostile environments, really, this is what
creates, you know, the slide before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having these problems gets us to maybe
either A, learn how to farm better,
[SPEAKER_00]: or B, pull out the, you know, pull out the
tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try to, you know, to pull, stop this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pests are really, you know, a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross-contamination is easy to do in a lot
of these big facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people walking by with
trays of clones right past the harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, trays or carts going by with
harvested material and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mold is a big one everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times mold can be, you know,
just in some of these other states that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people in Oklahoma were super
fearful of mold on their outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dealt with outdoor crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dealt with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powering mildew is usually, you know,
a big one for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times it can be corrected
even in the growing medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people I spent 10 years chasing
environments around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot, oh, down below there's an
environment too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get that one right,
you're not going to correct any of this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hand-in-hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why greenhouse planning is
super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dealing with that for a long
time just in the idea that it's cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're using them in the summertime,
and not all these places work well for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the systems that are allowed or
available, not allowed available.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get into the ventilation systems,
a lot of people look for cooling,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of times I'm just trying to
avoid the solar gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can use these wet-walled
cooling systems, but again, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: work everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work great in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work great where it's really hot and
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's places in Southern California they
work really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a greenhouse one time in Death
Valley, of all places, and it was 114
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees outside, but they had the
greenhouse at 85 degrees inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They struggled when it rained outside and
the monsoon seasons came, and so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why I always like, you know, think about
it or say, you know, the greenhouses are
[SPEAKER_00]: only as controllable as the weather
outside sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the variables and changes in the
weather are going to change the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and how it actually operates
and how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, you know, hard to hear people
say I'm going to get a hybrid greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and really it's almost like an indoor grow
room with some free sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also can be kind of expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to tell people they're better off
just growing indoors rather than trying
[SPEAKER_00]: the hybrid greenhouse thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transpiration is the number one reason
that we have condensation in greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so a lot of times when people talk to
me about humidity in their greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want me to go up to them and say,
oh, just plug this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it'll take care of all your
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can ship it to you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what it is is backing up and
getting people to understand their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes we have not a complete
understanding of farming and what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing when we're getting into these
greenhouses into the summertime,
[SPEAKER_00]: creating these hostile environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have plants that are just like
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ours is called perspiration, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are called transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when a plant sweats, it gives off
moisture just like we do, even though it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't drip down its forehead,
it sticks to the roof of the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and wants to drip back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times condensation is a
result of plant sweat first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we deal with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of people would say default to
a cooling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I've been saying this whole
time, the cooling systems don't always
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the ways to deal with it,
A, is avoid solar gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need the greenhouse effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B is using diffusion, whether it's in
a climate stream, also known as a shade
[SPEAKER_00]: cloth, or through the greenhouse covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greenhouse covers can actually do
amazing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, diffusion you know, also the
greenhouse manufacturers, not the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers themselves, the people that
make these covers, the glass and the
[SPEAKER_00]: diffuse people kind of go head to head.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glass people will say, you know,
1% light is 1% growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diffusion people say, well,
I'm splitting light particles in half and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gathering more particles even on a
cloudy day than I would if I was directly
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I find that to be true a lot of
times because through the testing that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done on the cannabis from inside and
outside, we can see some of these delicate
[SPEAKER_00]: properties or you know, these terpenes and
these cannabinoids show up when they
[SPEAKER_00]: normally would get zapped or burned away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun can be really intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the colors that we use in
the greenhouse also can affect how the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this part of the video isn't as
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get over here, it's one of my
favorite tools in the greenhouse too,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: 103 degrees, I move it over three inches
and it's down to 86 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just the colors that I use in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really why you see a lot of tans and
grow bags and white ground cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were historically using black
ground cover because that's what the store
[SPEAKER_00]: sold, black plastic pots, because that's
what they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the smart pots were all black for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually we started seeing these lighter
colors and these other options come around
[SPEAKER_00]: because I really started pushing them and
using this thing all the time telling me
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you see, you know,
your root system in a black container up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 130 degrees, even if the air
temperature isn't that high, we already
[SPEAKER_00]: are running into a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water conservation in California was super
huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was another reason that we
were trying to understand some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things in the water usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see full sun under the
diffused, no ground cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does drop the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it actually made the
temperatures drop even more by using the
[SPEAKER_00]: white ground cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brown dirt still absorbs or stores
some energy and heat compared to the white
[SPEAKER_00]: ground cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so am I supposed to do a Q&A towards
the end or is this the end?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you end here in a couple minutes,
we'll have 10 minutes for Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 10 minutes for Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see more of this stuff on my
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's on this slide right here because
we're going to do a Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you go to my Instagram account,
Light Depth Greenhouse, you'll see a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more videos that I've posted over the
course of time on some of these concepts
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have people in Oklahoma that
were really fearful of heat and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have people in other states that
just want to do proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that I tell
people, especially in the greenhouse class
[SPEAKER_00]: that I teach at Oakster Dam University,
is proof of concept can be pretty simple
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as getting a hoop house standing on
a ladder and pulling tarps for two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really learn a lot about the
plant, the business, how things are really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go, the genetics that you're
going to run in a small two-month window
[SPEAKER_00]: and pulling tarps yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't beat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, depending on the hoop
house you get, you can get it for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people going really big and really
expensive just on the idea of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they haven't really ironed out a lot
of the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to stay in business and get
the most bang for your buck, I always
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend trying something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of times, depending,
even in California, we can legally do six
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a 16 by 12 foot hoop,
pull a tarp two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you blow it, you still learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Q&A?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, if you have a question,
raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm seeing big money and interest bring
together, say, in the art, data room,
[SPEAKER_01]: technology, and HVAC, and to create these
uber hybrid greenhouses in places like
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm still not sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the heat load that you're going
to be carrying through the winter there,
[SPEAKER_01]: not to mention the engineering is going to
go into that facility for snow load.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have this sealed grow
environment in a place where, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: claiming to me, like, well, still on these
cloudy days in northern Michigan,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're still getting 300 or 400 micromoles
on a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have yourself holding the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm still not sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just wondering if you've done the
engineering, or know anybody that has,
[SPEAKER_01]: in those northern latitudes where they
just don't have a lot of sunshine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yet people are still trying to sell
these uber hybrid greenhouse concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, again, greenhouses were
invented for wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll do good throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the summertime where I see them have
the most problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most people, like I said,
with their year-round greenhouse are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to grow in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yes, getting these fancy,
expensive, using other people's money to
[SPEAKER_00]: get these things going, big investments,
a lot of finance going on for big
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and big dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, a lot of people have some
variables and learning curves to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, yeah, it needs to be a
little bit pump the brakes and do this in
[SPEAKER_00]: sections, a little bit smaller phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always look for phase one and phase two
upgrades, if possible, all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people have big money and
want to go in and make a splash,
[SPEAKER_00]: make a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're setting the bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, we're setting the bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be the ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people are cool with
spending a bunch of money, getting a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of things they don't know how to run,
create a bunch of data that's only maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: to them, and not share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of it's not so great to
share the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, I get hired to go around
and deal with a lot of these experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to sort out what to do about
making them work efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them will work fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to take, and I've seen this
in a couple other facilities, it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: five-year learning curve.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have two questions for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a greenhouse here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the glazing that we went with
originally was the SolarSopt 85 100.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were pretty shocked to see the
reduction in transmission that was coming
[SPEAKER_04]: through that glazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're looking at potentially
re-glazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we need to re-glaze with a
different SolarSopt, a SolarSopt 90 40%
[SPEAKER_04]: transmission, the first question is,
what would be your ideal ratio
[SPEAKER_04]: transmission versus diffusion?
[SPEAKER_04]: The second question is, have you ever
experimented with any earth-to-air heating
[SPEAKER_04]: systems for greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part of the question,
and if I forget the second part,
[SPEAKER_00]: just remind me, I've got short-term memory
loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part of the question is,
I always use SolarSopt 85, but I work with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of greenhouse companies,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of different info out
there on what's coming back from these
[SPEAKER_00]: farms and whether they should switch,
go to clear, single, or double.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the discussion with a greenhouse
manufacturer right outside here about this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I was saying, I always benefited
from SolarSopt 85 single wall corrugated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the wintertime, it can get kind of
drippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of gets tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because on a double wall diffuse,
typically, the manufacturers will say it
[SPEAKER_00]: transmits 74% to 79% light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a single wall, they'll say it
transmits up to 85% light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while the transmission is
important, I think the diffusion is just
[SPEAKER_00]: as important, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really tough to get our cake
and eat it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are coming out with more things
over the course of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in Colorado, you're closer to the
sun, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always see closer, higher up the
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not always worried about the shading
as much, but one of the things that needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen is that our metric back in the
day and still to this day is that we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to get 50 pounds per 1,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our minimum average harvest,
50 pounds in 1,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we weren't hitting that, we had a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hit that plenty of times with
diffuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't a matter of yields or
whatever that we weren't getting from some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these greenhouse covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, it had to do with the
control, that word control, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: support of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summertime, we'd get a lot of
condensation because the plants overheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to deploy shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deploying shade cloth restricts light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turning on the cooling systems also helps,
but sometimes it was a combo of both,
[SPEAKER_00]: shade, cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're diffused, but we're
restricting light rather than diffuse,
[SPEAKER_00]: splitting light, and creating more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they say is that diffusion can
restrict and diffusion can split light
[SPEAKER_00]: particles and create, make more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I always say that diffusion
is almost like magic because it's creating
[SPEAKER_00]: more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there are people starting to
split the hairs a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know to say you should do
this, but that's kind of what I'm knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as the cooling or heating
systems, the natural ones, like the got or
[SPEAKER_00]: the geothermal type stuff, it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see that as like a dream part of the
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to make sure that that's
affordable and that somebody's done it
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really going to work because I
see a lot of people that want to follow
[SPEAKER_00]: the dreams on the first go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be kind of expensive because we
kind of need to get the business up and
[SPEAKER_00]: running with what works and what's
affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes, you know, if it's
affordable and you got a good person that
[SPEAKER_00]: knows how to do it, then by all means do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I come from the background of a lot of
people that come up and go, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason they get hired and
they don't really know how to do these
[SPEAKER_00]: things, you know, and it costs more money
time to get this stuff working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe it does or doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so time and money is really important
in cannabis to get up and running right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and get a return on investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I was kind of go with
simple and what works, get some return
[SPEAKER_00]: going and then start following the dreams
a little bit, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got time for one more.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just following up on what he was
asking as far as like the solar soft 85.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just kind of shocked because we
were doing some spot measurements that
[SPEAKER_03]: were finding basically by the time things
hit the canopy about 75% reduction in part
[SPEAKER_03]: and right up next to the glazing material,
more like a 50%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to get it analyzed
because there was some confusion over
[SPEAKER_03]: whether or not it was actually that
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just curious if you've done
measurements, you know, on like big,
[SPEAKER_03]: like very sunny day with that material,
what kind of reduction in intensity you're
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing, because obviously there's going to
be some as it's coming through the
[SPEAKER_03]: material and then the diffusion may change
things a little bit too, but just follow
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the power meter is kind of fool
me or the power meter is on my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: way of metering light.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times for me, I use a lux meter
and try to find out you know, not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily the sun's intensity through
par, but the amount of light that's
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so play around with a lux meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even get an app on your iPhone to
kind of see how bright things are from
[SPEAKER_00]: inside to outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a greenhouse facility that was
kind of in a cloudy day the other day and
[SPEAKER_00]: they really rely on their Gavita lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're just all about the lights in
the winter, keep the blackout closed,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of run it like an indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled out my lux meter and we had like,
you know, it was like 1200 lux under the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gavitas and then when he opened the
curtain and turned off the lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were over 13,000 at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, in a lot of ways, he was doing
self a disservice by relying on the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and not getting some of the free sun
because of the sun's intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I wasn't using a par meter to
kind of quantify its intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm not a huge par person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I know it's important to some
people, I just from my background,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of big cannabis grows and
a lot of wheat come out of these
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses and a lot of them have been in
the diffuse, but now we're kind of in this
[SPEAKER_00]: new age.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new era where people are, you know,
maybe producing less and I don't always
[SPEAKER_00]: equate it to the greenhouse skins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Eric Branstak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Eric.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
