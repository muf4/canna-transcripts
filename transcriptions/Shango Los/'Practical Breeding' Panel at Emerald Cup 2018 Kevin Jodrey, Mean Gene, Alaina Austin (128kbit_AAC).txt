[SPEAKER_02]: So to my right we have Elena from
Greenbiter Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next we have the meme master himself,
Meme Gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally on the end we've got Kevin
Jodry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to start it off today by
basically throwing it out to the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think of when you hear
the word practical breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a broad term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to a lot of people it means a lot of
things, so let's try to clarify a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Practical breeding in my eyes is
stabilization, making sure you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: intersex traits, looking for, you know,
it's really like every breeder has their
[SPEAKER_01]: own palette.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give every one of us, you know,
almost the same genetics and we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come out with something
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So practical breeding for me is making
sure you have stabilized genetics to your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, though basically,
like I said, intersex issues, make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's hearty, no molding issues,
resilient to you know, outdoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: nasty weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically what I call practical
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making sure that what you do is stable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stability is key.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can definitely agree with everything
she's saying and to add to that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like just basically with
practical breeding, trying to reach those
[SPEAKER_04]: goals, you know, it might be a terpene
profile or a drug profile, but basically
[SPEAKER_04]: just trying to get where you're going,
you know, and doing those, doing whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: tricks you can, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like she said, definitely resistance
to pests and pathogens, structure,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, trying to take something and fix
it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you're increasing the yield,
just trying to get to all those goals that
[SPEAKER_04]: you have for everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say that's definitely the practical
side of it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say thank you for listening to
me talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you're very tired of hearing me
speak by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at practical breeding more as a
functional breeding and it's really just
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your objective and that's
ultimately what you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people look at the holy grail
where all things match and work and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a lot of people, it's just really
trying to steer something in a realm that
[SPEAKER_00]: they desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that what it does, it allows
individuals to be able to make these
[SPEAKER_00]: choices without judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it becomes, I think,
hypercompetitive in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're all trying to do something
unbelievable for a lot of people as they
[SPEAKER_00]: go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really to first solve the first
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Alana was saying, intersex
traits, stability, gene science,
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are crucial and those are both
separate directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea with practical breeding for
me in this context is to decide what is it
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're seeking and then to go chase
that first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you systematically work through
all these other problems until you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately a stable package.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that in mind, I think like a good
way of kind of discussing the practical
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding is let's just say that someone
wants to create a line of their own,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe suited to their farm, their climate,
wherever they're based.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing I would ask is,
do you think we should take the kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: Luther Burbank approach that you just
described where we're selecting one
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristic and just trying to nail
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it possible to nail multiple things
each generation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally think it's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, the genetics that are
here today are some of the best that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost hard to get better than what
we're seeing, besides making it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, having such sequential charpings
that are against, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens and bugs and are so hardy and
resilient to mold that that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: direction that I think is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you put everything together
from taste, from the hardiness to yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have plenty of footboards in
our lineup that I believe have,
[SPEAKER_01]: not at all because it's hard to do that,
but almost there, you know, just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly believe in not just one direction
with breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, unless you have one specific
thing you're going for, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: just sticking with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't go, you know, any direction
you truly please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like, as a grower,
you look for structure that you like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you look for smells that you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: After so many years, you're like,
you can look at something and imagine,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my girlfriend's looking at me,
I was throwing out male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's not what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I truly believe you can search for
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree with that for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is, you know, if you can take a
look at stuff and go ahead and make a list
[SPEAKER_04]: in your head and go, okay, here,
you know, here's the end goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's based on these little
objectives along the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then something that's really cool now
is that we're all being able to work with
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot more plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you have a list, if you go,
okay, I needed to hit all these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you only have a few plants,
there's not a high likelihood that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: actually going to hit all those marks with
a few plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have a whole lot of plants,
then all of a sudden you might say,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, now going through in this
generation, we have, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you might, when you really think about it,
there might be 50 things that you really
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have enough plants, you can look
through and go, wow, this generation,
[SPEAKER_04]: we just got to, you know, we only had
eight of these things really working for
[SPEAKER_04]: us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you go through one generation,
find these right parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden you might go from
eight traits you want, and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_04]: you're at 35 traits you want in one
breeding, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that being like,
you, like we were talking about resistance
[SPEAKER_04]: to things that might be like, oh,
this one's really resistant to
[SPEAKER_04]: caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, spider mites will come out
of the trees to find it, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you might go, oh, but we got this
one, and look, it actually, it doesn't get
[SPEAKER_04]: either of these pests looking for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then all of a sudden, you know,
you're there with that one, but with a
[SPEAKER_04]: smaller population, you're not going to
hit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think with big populations and a
clear goal, trying to narrow it down where
[SPEAKER_04]: you're hitting all your marks,
it really can be done fast, but you have
[SPEAKER_04]: to have, the idea of what goals you really
want to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as you go through, sometimes
you're finding more things that you didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: even realize you wanted, but you see,
ooh, that's desirable, all right,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's lock that in too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your list might grow, as you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go, okay, we want these 50 things,
and then all of a sudden you see it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you go, ooh, but they're, okay,
let's lock in these other three or four,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you keep moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's definitely possible to make a lot
of progress really fast with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think narrowing down the focus of your
direction, meaning I want to go with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to develop a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people use
pollination methodologies where they cover
[SPEAKER_00]: a tremendous amount of different parental
stock with similar pollen, and then chase
[SPEAKER_00]: it out in these broader patterns,
and the problem is you can't really find
[SPEAKER_00]: what's coming out of your lines,
because these populations you need to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at that are big enough, when you start to
spread it out in too many different
[SPEAKER_00]: directions, it's kind of hard to figure
out what's coming out of the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scientifically, we can look at traits
to find out levels of heterozygosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it going to be dissimilar,
or is it homozygous, am I fixed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And science helps, but like, they know
their lines well, so when they throw this
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen on something, they say,
hey, that's something that I know I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want or I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of that is because they're
working their lines heavily with the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge base, and I think a lot of
people, when they're throwing pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're spreading themselves out too far,
too quick, and it doesn't allow them to
[SPEAKER_00]: really go into the plant and find out what
are the traits I really see that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of this, because you're going
to have to see a population big enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the recessives, and those are the
outliers that you're trying to find,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, when you're talking,
you know, caterpillar resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: light resistance, I don't know how many
plants you've got to go through to find
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but when you find the outlier,
you know, okay, in this line, this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeking, and then you'll start to find
other traits that you can recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: visually that seem to go along,
because genes appear, they're not just
[SPEAKER_00]: individual light switches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem with CRISPR technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR technology is we're going to edit
things in and out, but when we wipe
[SPEAKER_00]: something out, we also wipe other things
out that we're not aware of, and so
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional reading practices are really
this swirling of genes to find
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations that work in directions,
and I think that if you work a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: line, you try to stay constant,
even if it may not be the end result you
[SPEAKER_00]: want at the end, what you did is you
developed an ability to start
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding the pattern of
repeatability, and I think that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go through that, and I think that
readers are misunderstood for their
[SPEAKER_00]: forward vision of what they really want to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very clear vision down the
road, and they chase that, and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't hit it, but it's okay,
because the process of chasing it is what
[SPEAKER_00]: really refines the skill set in chasing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to practice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendelian squares are great, but it
doesn't work with polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too many options, and so this
looking and choosing and finding a
[SPEAKER_00]: generation that works and realizing you
went the wrong direction, wrong parental
[SPEAKER_00]: stock, you go the other direction,
you find the right parental stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a huge skill set that has to be
developed, and I think patience is the
[SPEAKER_00]: part that you have to have more than
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, on that topic of going through
the stock you created and pheno hunting,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you guys think about is an
appropriate number to pheno hunt with?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of people seem, in my
opinion, to have growing numbers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's kind of this undertone of
bigger is always better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you agree with that, and what number do
you think people should aim to do if they
[SPEAKER_02]: want to hunt some of their own work to
truly find out what's lying inside it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I've seen people pop a
12-pack and find multiple winners,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I've seen people talk,
you know, pop 100, 200 seeds and not even
[SPEAKER_01]: find a winner, so it's truly in the
genetics you're sourcing, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've popped, you know, a few skunk
seeds from an old, old, old, old grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it was from older than I
was, way before pre-96, and first they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't pop, next thing they popped,
but nothing came out too special,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was just, you know, a hundred and
three seeds, so sometimes it's all about
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual genetics and the parents that
you're getting, not just the large phenol
[SPEAKER_01]: hunt that you're doing, but if,
like, I say something like my dozy does,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance, if I pop 500 seeds of that,
it's hard to cull, you know, any of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single one has amazing terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, do I want the skittles
that's got the lemon and the lime and the
[SPEAKER_01]: citrus, or do I want more of, like,
the OGKB dominant, or, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's truly amazing to go through each
phenol and, like, see how homogenous
[SPEAKER_01]: things truly are and how, you know,
sometimes things are fairly young,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the ancestor size through different
parentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's truly amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know how to get something that I
think everybody should do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it depends kind of on what
you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like she said, if you already have
something and it's already been taken to a
[SPEAKER_04]: place where there's not much variation,
then, you know, you're just trying to find
[SPEAKER_04]: a slight improvement, like maybe
everything's there, but you want it to
[SPEAKER_04]: yield a little better, you might get
there, you might only need 10 plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: or you might even get there without five
good girls and go, okay, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: this one's just a lot bigger, okay,
cool, we're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: For what your goal is, your goal might be
simple, but then, like, if, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: say if there's kind of two different
aspects to bleeding, there's like
[SPEAKER_04]: preservation work or invention work,
and then there's like trying to get right
[SPEAKER_04]: to that cold, which is more for what,
like, a commercial producer really wants,
[SPEAKER_04]: where it's like, okay, this is everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're gonna do preservation work,
ideally, you wanna have no less than 200
[SPEAKER_04]: plants all in basically what would be
almost like an open field situation,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, if it's in a room or whatever,
but that preserves the full genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity, but that's different than just
trying to go, okay, we really want this
[SPEAKER_04]: big fat bud full of terpenes and THC or
CBD or whatever you're going for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it definitely, the numbers is
different, and then like I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, invention work, like, you know,
some people are gonna take like really
[SPEAKER_04]: cool things and just put them together,
and then that can go to other people,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then they run with that, and then they
try to dial it in too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all different numbers games.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's totally different goals, and you have
to look at it like that when you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: through a program.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the numbers are great for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to grow a thousand plants
in one thing, because how am I gonna smug
[SPEAKER_04]: a thousand plants and see which one's
really the best?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you really can't be hands-on in a giant
population.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good for, once you have it to where
you like it, but you have one issue,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's all you're trying to fix,
then a thousand is great, because you go,
[SPEAKER_04]: here's the one the caterpillars didn't eat
out of a thousand, because you couldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: find that in 50 seeds if that's how it
worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's definitely,
if you really want to know what's the best
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke and what people really like,
you're gonna be better off only having 10
[SPEAKER_04]: or 20 females, so we can all sit here and
really mull it over, because otherwise
[SPEAKER_04]: it's impossible to analyze all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has to be analyzed by humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can't just be all laboratories,
because a laboratory can tell you,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, this has so many turbines,
and it's so much of these desirable ones,
[SPEAKER_04]: and when a human smells it, they go,
um, this doesn't smell bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then something might look like it's
not even special, and all of a sudden it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, whoa, everybody loves this thing,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to be hands-on, and you can't
be hands-on with a hundred thousand plants
[SPEAKER_04]: in a big old field.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be in touch.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the plant, and actually feel like
what it does to you, and have other people
[SPEAKER_04]: experience it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to keep it limited to a
certain point, but that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're just trying to fix one thing,
and it's like an agriculture problem,
[SPEAKER_04]: like we need one that's easy to harvest
with machines, or whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_04]: then yeah, you might want to run out
thousands and thousands.
[SPEAKER_04]: You already know everything else is there,
and you need to fix out one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're just looking for the magic,
you're gonna have to really get in there,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're not doing that with a million
plants, we're not gonna know what's there,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just depends on the goals,
really, for numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people exaggerate the
numbers they're looking through,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it sounds better when there's a
number 842 after the plant's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, special skunk 842.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, how the hell do you just
want 842 of these things, and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: keep track of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm somebody that hunts plants in
different directions too, because I hunt
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff for, like, biomechanics,
and when you're talking about extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is numbers, because we're gonna pull it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can infuse terpenes to these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're talking large
populations, I'm looking for outliers
[SPEAKER_00]: numerically, and for specific reasons,
but you know, what Gene's saying is he's
[SPEAKER_00]: saying if you're gonna smoke this stuff,
then ultimately that has to be the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to smoke that many
different varieties and really start to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare them back and forth, and it's a
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so populations that are, you know,
50 plants, they're actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta take in and go through them and
consume them one after another,
[SPEAKER_00]: then log them, and you have to standardize
when you smoked them, and what was your
[SPEAKER_00]: mental state when you did, because
otherwise you're putting your perception
[SPEAKER_00]: on it, so you're not being objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're talking huge quantities,
a lot of times, you know, that's because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working with stuff that's not as
stable in its reproductive abilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning you're gonna see a tremendous
amount of deviation from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that helps you neck down to get a
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, you can start to work
on refinement, which is like Alana said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen packs that, you open a pack up
and there was five killers, so there was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 10 seeds, five of them were
girls, all of them were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just took on a little different
directions, and you made the choice on
[SPEAKER_00]: where you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you crack old, you know,
packs, you're looking at hundreds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and none of them are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of it is you have to actually
crack some seeds and take a look at what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing, and that'll kind of help
you understand how big a population you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to look through.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no set number, but most of the
time I see people tell me they look
[SPEAKER_00]: through this many and I'm like,
how'd you keep track?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they look at me and I go,
oh, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just kind of, you know,
can't affront.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the point, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes, man, smaller populations,
like I look for outliers over the course
[SPEAKER_00]: of years, so I'll go through a population,
I'll look at 50, and then I'll keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that I believe are best from that 50,
and then I'll run another 50, and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: pull the outlier out from that,
and then I can compare the choices I made
[SPEAKER_00]: from each one of those selective groups
and compare them against each other and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, hey, is one a clear winner,
or do they have different distinctions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of it now is where you're
selecting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're selecting your varieties for
indoor operations, that's what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get selected, but that doesn't
mean it's going to do well in greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: debt, or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where the selection process happens
dictates the number you need, what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want, and then you have to make sure you
say, this did well here under these
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstances, because it doesn't mean you
can transfer that selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I'll do multiple selections
on the same stock so that I have something
[SPEAKER_00]: that works indoor, something that works
outdoor, and they're both pretty similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have different resistances to
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor is a little easier because it
doesn't have to have the sensitivity
[SPEAKER_00]: factor to moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where outdoor, it has to have a natural
resistance, because you can't control that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all that goes into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're doing this stuff, you just
kind of have to be practical about it
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, and don't hold yourself to a
constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to screw up and hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make some mistakes while
you're looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to throw some good ones away,
and eventually you start picking up good
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just touched on the next question,
which is basically the future of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: production worldwide seems to be moving
into an outdoor, sun-grown setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet we seemingly see a lot of breeding
still being done indoors, and pest
[SPEAKER_02]: management and things like mold and fungus
are commonly not listed as high on the
[SPEAKER_02]: list of attributes that people are
breeding for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that in mind, how can people help
to select for these traits?
[SPEAKER_02]: We reference the females that you can see
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about males?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you find the males that have got
IPM resistance and things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw them outside and see how they do
outside in some nasty ass weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they can handle it, they don't look
decrepit and ready to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean, some males don't even
water them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hardy, so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The structure's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You give them a little stem rub,
and they smell insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like the regular, like, uh,
smell like everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always the ones that stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially like, I want to say,
you know, the torture chamber is always
[SPEAKER_01]: the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds crazy, but, you know,
stress them.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how they turn out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a trick actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Males, if you, you know, a lot of times
people when they're breeding, they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: let the males go long enough to really see
what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've noticed that males that are from
stuff that's not really mold resistant,
[SPEAKER_04]: the males themselves, if you let them run
and run and run, the males will actually
[SPEAKER_04]: mold themselves like a female,
but a lot of times a lot worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing will just turn to mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a trick for selecting males
that's really cool that I kind of just
[SPEAKER_04]: figured out on accident, and I've never
heard anybody mention it before.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of a cool tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you actually bud your males all the way
out, the way a plant grows, everything
[SPEAKER_04]: closest to the tips is going to go first.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what really starts flowering first.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, things tough that when they
flower, that's kind of how it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what's lower down will be later on
males.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you take everything that's already
flowered and you leave what's lower and
[SPEAKER_04]: you let it regrow, still in flowering
mode, it'll want to shoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those secondary shoots that come up,
they'll actually show what kind of the
[SPEAKER_04]: resin that plant produces.
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't do it at first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people don't know this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like top secret info, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: It will grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will grow back, and it'll almost be
like you reversed it to be a female.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you can actually smell the resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really wanted to get nitty gritty,
you could actually harvest those little
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves and maybe dry them, stick them in a
bomb.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can at least rub the resin on your
fingers and feel it, and you can tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so by taking males not only full term,
but longer than full term, by cutting them
[SPEAKER_04]: and letting them grow back again,
you'll get actually a whole different look
[SPEAKER_04]: at a male.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't seen people do it really on
purpose, but I've started doing it on
[SPEAKER_04]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm able to just smell all my
males like they're females.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't have to reverse it,
because you can reverse males and turn
[SPEAKER_04]: them to females.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which if you do that, you can actually
make, instead of making feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll make regular seeds with male and
female, because the male has that
[SPEAKER_04]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's definitely a huge trick and it
really helps you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then by doing that too, you see it's
in the late stages that most things get
[SPEAKER_04]: attacked by things like mildew and pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get tired.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're older plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They start to break down their health.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so by taking them all the way to where
they had blood, cutting them back,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then they grow again, it's like
they're really in the latest stages.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have the most resin production.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the least resistance to pests
and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the things that you see get attacked,
you're able to note that really easily,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you can't do that if you have a male
and it drops some pollen and you collect
[SPEAKER_04]: it, then you're going to have to go
through the process of growing out the
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds to even know what it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what a male does, it doesn't
necessarily pass that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with a lot of the genetics that any of
us want to play with that are already
[SPEAKER_04]: desirable at this point, especially in the
marketplace, these things are pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: bottlenecked down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means that the things that you
see in a plant, they'll probably carry
[SPEAKER_04]: through in most cases to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas if you have a really open
population that has everything from a land
[SPEAKER_04]: race, you might find this really cool
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the frequency of those genetics
actually popping up in the line are really
[SPEAKER_04]: rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually being able to see what the
males do in most of the modern stuff we
[SPEAKER_04]: work with, it actually tells you most of
what you need to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll know pretty well what it's
going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, I think, is the biggest trick to
really knowing what those males are going
[SPEAKER_04]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's kind of cool now is that you can
access lab tech that you couldn't access
[SPEAKER_00]: prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it lets you copy scientific
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lecture after this one that
thinks scientific reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that it's accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're more interpretive,
intuitive readers where you look and you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with science, it just helps speed up
some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have to look and feel because
ultimately it's a human perception that
[SPEAKER_00]: dictates the reality that they've created
and they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with populations now, you can bring in
stock into the laboratory and test for
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can bring a leaf sample into a lab
and test it for fungal propensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it lets me see does it or does it not
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows you to actually do reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was, if you're reading
indoor, how do you go outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my thing is I select in the
environment that I want the product to be
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you can use lab technology to help
you really work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: An indoor breeding operation where the
plants then get tested at a lab and they
[SPEAKER_00]: infect it with the fungal issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does it or does it not take hold?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a high resistance,
then you can say that population is
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of people as we go forward,
say I like hobby breeders because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that the beauty of working with your own
cannabis genetics is something that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the dawn of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what allows people to
have an individual relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis where they say, hey, look,
I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I chose because I like
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that human connection to the plant to
me is the thing that made all of us really
[SPEAKER_00]: go where we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're an industrial cannabis society,
but fundamentally all of us were just weed
[SPEAKER_00]: lovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to be able to dial in stuff
we dug.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you can use technological tools
that just make it really pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can figure out what direction
you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it goes back to using
your intuitive skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like being able to have the tools
because ultimately it takes time and a
[SPEAKER_00]: process of working out what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And predictability is something that takes
a lot of time and a lot of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the ability to have more plants
now under permits, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, it's still time and
energy and money you're having to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything that's going to compress that
for you, I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so indoor work, which we use for
reproduction because it's quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: I never used it for selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I can take that stock and have it
lab infected and then find out the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take it and put any kind of
pathogen on it in a lab and find out
[SPEAKER_00]: what's its resistance factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just feeds it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say someone's got their line well
in the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like what they've found and they've
even got a few of the properties they're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for within it.
[SPEAKER_02]: At what point should they be worried about
potential loss and vigor if they are kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of inbreeding each generation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you recommend that they look to
outcross or should you really just stick
[SPEAKER_02]: with the one line?
[SPEAKER_02]: And just keep working it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends how the genetics work when you
start it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've seen genetics get watered
down, even mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people regenerate their mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they're not as hardy as the
first one that you did maybe 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that inline breeding is great
for that as long as the genetics of the
[SPEAKER_01]: parents are hardy enough to you're not
watering it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're going in a direction,
you're selecting things that are improving
[SPEAKER_01]: it, I think inline works great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with inbreeding lines, what happens a
lot of times is you get this condition
[SPEAKER_04]: called inbreeding depression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's argued among people who study
genetics what it really comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the people who are a little
more progressive with their thinking on it
[SPEAKER_04]: think that it actually comes from the fact
that in inbred things, anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever it is, dogs or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people will tell you, oh German
shepherds, Rottweilers, they get bad hips.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because they're inbred.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually because they're inbred and
then they're selected wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they develop these things and you
can't get rid of them because the genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: are bottlenecked, meaning that they've
gone from being a broad scope of different
[SPEAKER_04]: traits available to being only some things
that can actually express themselves
[SPEAKER_04]: through the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happens a lot of times is that
people say, oh, and I heard this when I
[SPEAKER_04]: was learning from people, you know,
they said, oh, we got the genetics and we
[SPEAKER_04]: bred it and we bred it, but then it got
tired, so we outcrossed it and then it was
[SPEAKER_04]: good again because of hybrid vigor,
which is what happens when things mix
[SPEAKER_04]: together and the dominant things take over
and you don't see all the trippy recessive
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that's hiding out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the reality of it is that if,
let's say you take like two really
[SPEAKER_04]: different things and you make a really
cool hybrid and you get this really cool
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that come out that are basically
better than everything that you started
[SPEAKER_04]: with, now if you select those plants and
you try different combinations with them,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of those, that will actually breed
true and it will stay in there and you can
[SPEAKER_04]: actually keep that going that direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what will happen is as soon as you
make a wrong selection that doesn't fit
[SPEAKER_04]: those criteria, stuff will start to kind
of, it will go the direction of what you
[SPEAKER_04]: picked and when things are inbred because
of that bottleneck, it's like you can
[SPEAKER_04]: think of it like a trail or a road.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't take turns anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you can't get there from here
like they say, you know, when you're in a
[SPEAKER_04]: weird neighborhood like this one over
here, I got lost in trying to find the
[SPEAKER_04]: back road.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't get there from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to go around like eight blocks to
get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not doable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it's the same thing like I just said.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be able to actually get back
there if you really, you can take that
[SPEAKER_04]: depressed line and go, well, we're going
to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a time when it's worth
growing a million plants because you go,
[SPEAKER_04]: look, here's that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetics don't ever really go away,
but you need huge numbers to find the
[SPEAKER_04]: things that get hidden again and that
aren't in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bottleneck will really hide those.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the inbreeding, the thing is that
once you're going to inbreed something,
[SPEAKER_04]: you really need to make the right choices,
which in a lot of cases means you need to
[SPEAKER_04]: make your self lots of options so that you
can go back through those again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise you're going to get lost on that
trail.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to go the wrong way and
you'll never be able to get back there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you make lots of options,
it's like, you know, it's like being in a
[SPEAKER_04]: corn maze and you'll just walk through the
corn real quick and get back in the right
[SPEAKER_04]: spot, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really the key.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my point being that my belief is that
inbreeding depression is a myth that's
[SPEAKER_04]: popularized by people making poor
selections just like with bad hips on
[SPEAKER_04]: dogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not because they're inbred.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because they're inbred with bad
traits, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's in the selection process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my take on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's always an option to bring
back vigor through hybridization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's practical if you can find
something that's really similar to where
[SPEAKER_04]: it doesn't really matter that you're like,
okay, well, this is really tired and I
[SPEAKER_04]: have this other thing that has all the
same traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be easy to fix it back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll be back there and revitalize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't just want to bring something
in just to try to fix everything back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: If possible, you want to make the right
choices first.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after a while, what you'll have that,
you know, you won't look at it and go,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, this is a tired little dead line.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll go, wow, this is an amazing pure
line that actually can outperform
[SPEAKER_04]: everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's true breeding and it's incredible
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what you get with horses,
dogs, plants that are bred properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody looks at it and goes, oh,
it's an inbreeding depression.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's struck and it's no good anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll still have maintained that proper
line and then it will be a renowned line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my take on, you know,
how the problems that you face when you
[SPEAKER_04]: inbreed stuff versus hybridization,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hybridization is like a quick shortcut to
try to fix something back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in reality, it's going to create all
this work to try to get, now we've got to
[SPEAKER_04]: get back to square one, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to make the right choices to
start.
[SPEAKER_04]: And give yourself options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a phrase called a felial
regression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it means is that over time,
all things reach the average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're putting quality products
together and you're making the selections
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, then what you'll have is you'll
have an overall higher average over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he was talking about the inbreed,
people believe that inbred stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible because we look at inbreeding
with the royals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you've had, you know, that's a
really good example because that was
[SPEAKER_00]: something that was common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see it in dogs and horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're inbreeding to fix traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a good breeder is pulling out the
outliers that have the qualities they
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put those back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a culling process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in animal breeding, they're culling
them and getting rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plant breeding, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are culling out and you're being very
discerning as to what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're able to take a look at the
work that you're doing, you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inbred lines are crucial because really
that's the only way you can take a trait
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want and put it on top of another
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so lines that you build and develop
that have characteristics you hold,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can use those as material that
you would want to out-cross to bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: other traits and qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can take inbred lines that are
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can have plant A, plant B,
plant C, plant D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can run these two concurrent lines,
same genetic base, but we steer them
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can bounce them against each other
down the road if we want to see these what
[SPEAKER_00]: we believe like vigor increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really about tightening up the
groups you're working with initially and
[SPEAKER_00]: making good selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, you're going to make
wrong selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find out you chose a plant
that when it breeds, it doesn't breed
[SPEAKER_00]: those traits back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I think it's hard for a lot
of people because you have to hold this
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hold seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hold the progenitors that
you're using, the male and the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets to be tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to hold large libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, for me, I like working
with people in conjunction where you do
[SPEAKER_00]: something, someone else does something,
and then the two of you can kind of work
[SPEAKER_00]: together to say, hey, let's chase a
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You chase a direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then together, we'll be able to solve
the problem in a little bit better fashion
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the plant populations can be
smaller for the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of material you have to hold
can be smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that you're working with
are going to see things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't because nobody's really all
knowing no matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to have an ability to chase it from
different directions, to have other
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals working on these projects in
some loose fashion really helps because it
[SPEAKER_00]: allows you a lot better chance to find
what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that there's a whole range of
questions we could ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've left a little over 10 minutes,
depending on if the audience has any
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a microphone to your left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like Jess is going to control that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't touch the mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I on?
[SPEAKER_05]: You are.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really impressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: This panel is the most impressive reading
panel I've encountered in years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so thank you for your efforts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being a troublemaker, my question is,
why haven't you mentioned epigenetics?
[SPEAKER_05]: The advancing learning we have about
epigenetic gene expression is totally
[SPEAKER_05]: transforming the evolutionary
conversation, the breeding conversation,
[SPEAKER_05]: the reproduction conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your guys take on where epigenetics
fits into your conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's funny, but we're learning so
much about how information is moved down
[SPEAKER_00]: through genes that I think really we're
almost ignorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I know is that every time I think
I know something, I find out I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I feel about epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about genetic movement
through 14 generations, material can be
[SPEAKER_00]: remembered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a transfer of information
that moves through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does the environment influence
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the cultivator's direction
influence that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that we really
understand it that well, because we worked
[SPEAKER_00]: off of these very simplified breeding
methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we started to get into
scientific breeding, it was basically from
[SPEAKER_00]: markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the understanding of how information
moves through time and what the impact is
[SPEAKER_00]: is something I don't think we really
understand that well, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that it's a huge conversation
that's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's one that has to happen with
cultivators, geneticists, and readers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can take a look and figure out what
moved through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with cannabis is that a
lot of the older material is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the older people that started
the project is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you're kind of in the middle of
the picture moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to really figure out what
moved from the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of know where we are, and we know
where we want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think we really know where we
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've cut back so much of the native
populations around the globe, which can't
[SPEAKER_00]: really go back and start to source this
material and start to compare it on a DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: level to see what changed and what didn't
change and why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that the question is
brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that I don't think any of us at
this point are really qualified to steer
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one is, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's fascinating to see that truth
that information moves forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they say talent skipping
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see families in anything,
plant, people, animal, where there's just
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievable traits that move through time
and trying to capture it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, it seems to travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's things that get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have another question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in listening, I've heard all three
of you say things that sounds to me would
[SPEAKER_03]: amalgamate really, really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Testing by torture, for instance,
which I call bomb-proofing, so that it
[SPEAKER_03]: gets easier and easier for someone to be
able to produce a given genetic if you do
[SPEAKER_03]: this, you're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do that, you're good,
too, instead of this is what you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: do to find you for that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But can we combine scientific reading,
where we're looking at pretty much having
[SPEAKER_03]: to have a lab tech in the process on the
fact in your reading, and preserve hybrid
[SPEAKER_03]: vigor by taking a parent line,
splitting off into looking for different
[SPEAKER_03]: traits, but with the same initial genetics
and reading for specific traits that are
[SPEAKER_03]: desirable there, then bring those lines
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by doing that, not be introducing
alien alleles, but regaining hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's totally possible,
especially, like I said, the parents that
[SPEAKER_01]: you first chose from are both genetically
stable and hardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're picking the traits that
are furthering the genetics, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: going further, even with finals,
it'd be great to use the scientific verse
[SPEAKER_01]: of basically setting in all your genetics,
seeing what isn't bad with pathogens,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what can handle what without even
having to torture your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, within keeping with the
genetics that you personally keep with,
[SPEAKER_01]: and stabilizing with just the choice of a
terpene profile, the cannabinoid profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the best thing of scientists that
we have, is that we can test our cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't do that just so long,
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finding new cannabinoids like THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even realize there was
cannabinoids that we, there's what,
[SPEAKER_01]: 130 something in a once an hour plus,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cannabis has more of a genetic
background than humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have like, I think it's maybe 48,
don't quote me, and humans have it,
[SPEAKER_01]: like 30 too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with cannabis, it's so much more
complex than even humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth still learning with it,
and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in anything that we consider pure,
there's still those variations,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you might discover like, okay,
well we have these ones that, this one
[SPEAKER_04]: really has the terpenes we want,
but this one really has the resistance,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you can go ahead and breed those
apart, and even if they were originally
[SPEAKER_04]: the same, if you breed them apart for long
enough, and do what you're saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's line breeding, so you make
these different lines of the same thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you come and you put them back
together, you'll actually get some hybrid
[SPEAKER_04]: vigor, again, even though it's the same
thing, and when you do that, then all of a
[SPEAKER_04]: sudden you're gonna have an improvement
over both those lines, so it's really
[SPEAKER_04]: worth, like what I like to do with
anything, even if I consider it all one
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, I have all these different lines
that go in different directions,
[SPEAKER_04]: and after a while, different ones prove to
do different things, and you can really
[SPEAKER_04]: use that with them to come back together,
to remake those, so that it is really
[SPEAKER_04]: valuable, and I mean, it's really common,
you can look at it like with dogs,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you go, I have these Rottweilers,
they've been in California for 85 years,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they've been bred really, really well,
and you know, you go ahead and breed them
[SPEAKER_04]: with something that somebody still has in
Germany, and make these new dogs,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's like, you know, that you might
all of a sudden end up with this dog breed
[SPEAKER_04]: that's incredible, and it's really the
same breed, it's just Rottweilers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're really not the same,
because they're different lines,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so by doing that, that would be a way,
like we were talking about, with like bad
[SPEAKER_04]: hips with dogs, you could go all of a
sudden, okay, well we just brought in the
[SPEAKER_04]: same thing, but it repaired what was
messed up by the inbreeding, and so doing
[SPEAKER_04]: the different lines is really good,
and I like to do that, I don't like to
[SPEAKER_04]: just run one direction really fast,
and get it all there, I like to take it in
[SPEAKER_04]: a few different directions, and go,
okay, this is the one, this is gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: the one that's great with the smell,
and the taste, and it's green,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this one over here has all the
resistance, and it's purple, and they were
[SPEAKER_04]: originally the same thing, but then you
have these two versions, and then when you
[SPEAKER_04]: put them back together, it's like you've
remade it, and when you've remade it,
[SPEAKER_04]: it actually made it better than it was
when you started, but it's still the same
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, so you really can do it,
and it's worthwhile, and it is one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: more practical things you could do in a
program for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any major crop, major crop just means
commoditizing globally, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: rice, corn, wheat, it's 10 years on a
development cycle, so three years of
[SPEAKER_00]: locating markers, another three years of
putting together your breeding lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then four years of running out those
lines, and you're running thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: lines, and you're looking through millions
of plants to find what you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for as these parental lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lets you get that type of stability
that people believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy a pack of seeds for
vegetables, you see a stability that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't quite understand how much work and
time went into it, and the problem that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have is that in cannabis, because it isn't
a business, but tech drives cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's where most of the investment money's
coming from, so tech expectations are
[SPEAKER_00]: instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: To them, 18 months is a fricking lifetime,
but in cannabis, that's a season and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half outdoor, and that's maybe five,
six runs inside where you really did some
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting and looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a big deal, and I think that most
people just lack the funding, and so there
[SPEAKER_00]: is no heavily funded breeding operations
where people can go and really chase this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff down the road and get these things
that you want without having to make
[SPEAKER_00]: concessions financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't play Frankenstein without a
castle filled with goodies to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't know how many people have it,
and I don't think that because the tech
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is pushing cannabis that the
understanding that you might be in
[SPEAKER_00]: business in 10 years, because to me,
tech is just unbelievably volatile,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's changed the way we approach
cannabis, and so to me, if you can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: longer view and realize that it's gonna
take a longer amount of time to stabilize
[SPEAKER_00]: and get those things, then you'll have
them, but if it takes major agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: corporations that have unlimited resources
and a technology you can't touch,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it takes them 10 years and a million
selection to get there, it's kinda hard
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to do it the way we do it,
and we get lucky, we pull out liars out to
[SPEAKER_00]: work, but the stability that people
believe you should have in cannabis based
[SPEAKER_00]: off of what they've purchased from other
agricultural commodities in any form is so
[SPEAKER_00]: different and so skewed between those two
groups, and I think you have to rein your
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations in, and that's where the
populations start to work, and you start
[SPEAKER_00]: to say, hey, I have stuff that works in
this direction, I got something nasty,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene, I want you to check it out and see
if you can work with it, and Alana's got
[SPEAKER_00]: quality material, she says, Gene,
I got some nasty stuff, I wanna play with
[SPEAKER_00]: you on this, and all of a sudden you're
able to team up like I talked earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no way one individual is gonna
fund that level of reading project over
[SPEAKER_00]: the course of time, because nobody can
really make decisions on what the public's
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes are gonna be, it's a strange du
jour kind of market, and so the problem is
[SPEAKER_00]: that whatever's hot is what's hot,
so anything that's hot this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's crossed into it, I don't give
a shit, every year, show me what's hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll show single pollen into 40 of the
hot cuts, next year, 40 of the hot cuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 of the hot cuts, I call it strange du
jour, and the problem with that is it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't allow you to really build anything
of any stability, which is what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, so I think that might bring us
to the end of our time frame, my name's
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy days, I'd love it if you could all
join me in giving a hand for the other
[SPEAKER_02]: panelists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
