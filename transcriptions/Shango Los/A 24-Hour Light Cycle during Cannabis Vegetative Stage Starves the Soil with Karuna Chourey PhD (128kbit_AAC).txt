[SPEAKER_01]: Hey there, so last weekend I was in Denver
for Indo Expo, and I was moderating a
[SPEAKER_01]: panel of soil science PhDs and During Q&A
I asked them so hey What are your thoughts
[SPEAKER_01]: on 24-hour light cycle during veg of
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know there's a lot of people
who argue a lot of different ways online
[SPEAKER_01]: about whether or not You have to give
Cannabis plans some dark time so that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can have a natural sleep cycle Or whether
or not you can run your plants at 24 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: of light and get finished with your veg
cycle 20% faster right over the course of
[SPEAKER_01]: the year you can actually Put in another
cycle in your garden, so there's a big
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage to that if it is possible So
anyway, I was curious what they would have
[SPEAKER_01]: to say so I asked the question and dr.
Karuna Chow Ray who's in R&D at mammoth
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes said Something that was
surprising to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know normally everybody talks about
the health of the plant itself about
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not it can do 24 hours a day of
photosynthesis and be healthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but she approached it totally different
She's like yeah, the plant grows up faster
[SPEAKER_01]: and bulkier, but what you're doing is you
are starving the rhizosphere You're
[SPEAKER_01]: starving all the microbes in the soil
which makes the plant super susceptible
[SPEAKER_01]: for all these different kinds of diseases
That's a whole different approach so after
[SPEAKER_01]: the panel I asked her to step aside with
me and get on camera and And answer the
[SPEAKER_01]: question so that I could bring it home to
you so that you could check it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: so This is dr. Chow Ray's answer if you
are into 24-hour lights, or if you just
[SPEAKER_01]: like thinking about photosynthesis I hope
you totally dig this Hey
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody, so I am here at Indo Expo
Denver today, and I just heard a fantastic
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation on microbes and the
rhizosphere and and my guest today caught
[SPEAKER_01]: me off guard by saying Something that kind
of blew my mind about the 24-hour light
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle as you may know There's a lot of
fervent debate online about whether or not
[SPEAKER_01]: you can grow cannabis plants in the
vegetative state for 24 hours a day Lit
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire time so having no dark period
and there's a lot of debate back and forth
[SPEAKER_01]: But but often there is not a lot of
evidence And then I meet Karuna today,
[SPEAKER_01]: and she has got some very interesting
things today about metabolites so Karuna
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining me For a
moment hearing you speak today caught me
[SPEAKER_01]: totally off guard and and I was excited to
hear Essentially for me new information in
[SPEAKER_01]: this debate people are having about the
24-hour light cycle So please if you would
[SPEAKER_01]: teach us all your thoughts on Whether or
not using light on for 24 hours is helping
[SPEAKER_00]: or inhibiting growing cannabis plants So
thanks for having me on this and asking
[SPEAKER_00]: this very important question well Plants
are like humans or any other living beings
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a diurnal cycle right we have our
day phase and our night phase if I may say
[SPEAKER_00]: They also Behave differently in day and
night in the daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the sunlight Where they are
going to use everything do you know
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesize sugars food so to say and The
plant is growing at the same time the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is also putting down sugars through
its roots to the microbes in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Right so there it's also communicating
with the microbes at night time all this
[SPEAKER_00]: activities will shut down and That kind of
metabolites so when I say sugars there are
[SPEAKER_00]: different sugars there are different
metabolites that they're released by the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant roots and They actually feed the
microbes that they love So the friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are the microbes that will help
the plant grow They are the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on this plant food now if you
keep the plant in only one cycle Then you
[SPEAKER_00]: are depriving the microbial population of
one category of food So while the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing tall They're growing in
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not exactly healthy for the entire
plant and its rhizosphere That is one
[SPEAKER_00]: reason that you give it a break So let the
plant flip the cycle and make the
[SPEAKER_00]: different set of metabolites Or not
constantly keep feeding the same
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite to its rhizosphere microbes
where the microbes might be like Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Overwhelmed with all these metabolites
being thrown at it at 24 hours so even
[SPEAKER_00]: though Microbes in the rhizosphere follow
this kind of diagonal cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not used to seeing this
metabolites Constantly constantly and that
[SPEAKER_00]: is one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you definitely have to give
the plants a break Let it rest so so to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that I understand you correctly
when the lights are on The plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: producing its sugars and photosynthesis
Everything that it normally does for
[SPEAKER_01]: itself, but when the light goes off It
pushes all the sugars out to the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere and your beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and so if we're running our lights
for 24 hours We are potentially starving
[SPEAKER_01]: our beneficial microbes that are in the
substrate And and so in addition to so so
[SPEAKER_01]: so the first thing that would even be bad
for the cannabis plant would be we're
[SPEAKER_01]: starving the beneficial microbes which
then makes the plant Itself less robust
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's got less microbes in the
rhizosphere What else is there anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else that might happen to the plant
itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: By not getting a break like like when we
don't get a rest we get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: delirious, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is always in the mode that it
has to grow grow grow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nighttime gives it a time to kind of rest
relax a little bit But now when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just keeping it under 24 cycle The only
thing it hears is keep growing creep Keep
[SPEAKER_00]: photo doing a photosynthesis keep growing
big and so in a way, this is not natural
[SPEAKER_00]: so I Think the plants are going to be
stressed in that format So that so
[SPEAKER_01]: technically that that stress could Express
itself in a lot of ways maybe decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids or less resistance to mold or
pests or however it Might be doing it very
[SPEAKER_00]: much in those grows that they have Almost
like sterile environment They can keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: closed and that's when they think that
giving it 24 hour life cycle is giving
[SPEAKER_00]: them bigger plants Which they think are
better plants, but that plant is just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of say propped up And the moment it takes
go a little bit so they won't be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: handle they're susceptible to a wide range
of things So so if the 24 like our light
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle is is is setting up the plant for
potential failure, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason people do it is because you can
reach the end of the bloom cycle About 20%
[SPEAKER_01]: faster, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people who are trying to do a
certain number of cycles a year for
[SPEAKER_01]: profit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying we're just gonna push the
plant To its extreme so that we can save
[SPEAKER_01]: that 20% of time exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you weigh that yourself as?
[SPEAKER_01]: the advantages to saving 20% versus the
the susceptibility of the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens So let me put it this way you
can save on the time and you can get more
[SPEAKER_00]: buds or more flowering cycles But what is
the quality of your buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sacrificing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your terpene profile are you sacrificing
your cannabinoid profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to gain that 20% extra time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to keep that in mind also to
maintain this 24 hour life cycle Like I
[SPEAKER_00]: said, you have to have practical yesterday
Room everything has to be so dialed in
[SPEAKER_00]: that you cannot change little bit
Otherwise your plant is going to just die
[SPEAKER_00]: or not perform as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are creating so many Restrictive
scenarios for growth whereas under a
[SPEAKER_00]: normal cycle You are not your plant is
healthy enough that it can withstand a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of fluctuation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what you want And you can keep
your cannabinoid profile steady.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep your terpene profile steady I
have heard very little about how the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is if you are bringing it down to
this very Short cycle I have not yet seen
[SPEAKER_00]: that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said Data is the first thing I will
look for
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the data because in your
presentation you were very clear that data
[SPEAKER_01]: is everything Would you share with us some
of the research that has been done on this
[SPEAKER_01]: and we can put it in the links below So
that people can check it out at home Sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: sure if I find something on cannabis
definitely if not definitely on other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants I'll just find out all these links
on What effect does 24 hour photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: have on plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely I can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much Karuna Charan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you You You
