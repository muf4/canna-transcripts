[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about an actual island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Vashon Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you were going to go that way
towards Danica, so I was kind of napping
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, my turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Shango Lowes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the founder of the Vashon Island
Marijuana Entrepreneurs Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the community organizing that I was
responsible for on my island is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: different than what you've heard so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that back when Washington State
still had medical, we had about 156
[SPEAKER_00]: producers of various, some were growers,
some were value-added products like
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone worked independently because
most of them were prohibition-era growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all know, prohibition-era
growers don't tend to come out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows very easily and connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take a little encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I decided I wanted to do,
because all of our growers and edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: makers were working as if they had to make
the entire change themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were selling their products locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because everyone was selling their
products, locally, the prices were
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly low on Vashon Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the growers were barely making
subsistence-level income.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I did is I formed our first
trade organization and brought the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: together and said, hey, listen,
I'm going to go ahead and make
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships for you with the medical
dispensaries throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can pool your flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll create a channel for them
to go to the medical dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, yeah, you'll be making twice as
much as you're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all like, we like your
business plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we realized that if we bring
together the growers, they can bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now living soil is now at a price that
they can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, all right,
we really want to do probiotic nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crappy salt nutrients are cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes we have to use that,
but we don't really want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, well, let's get everybody
together who wants to do probiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and let's buy the bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did is we took a community
of 150-some producers and pulled them into
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, for the first time, began to
speak with one voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to start getting coverage
in the newspaper as an organization and
[SPEAKER_00]: create the conversation that growers are
people, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers don't need to be on the fringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a grower and creating medicine for
people is an honorable role to play in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community and not something that we need
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to tolerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, with July of last year,
the state dismantled the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, the state really turned
their back on all of these grass roots
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs that came out of the shadows
and decided, OK, we will participate with
[SPEAKER_00]: you in this experiment of medical
marijuana in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, since very few of those
people were allowed to make the transition
[SPEAKER_00]: to the commercial market, almost all of
these businesses were pushed out of
[SPEAKER_00]: business by the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: It put these parents in the position of,
I either need to decide to keep the income
[SPEAKER_00]: from the business that I've been doing for
the last five, 10 years and be illegal,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I need to give up the income.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're done with the kids' extra summer
camp and all the extra things that come
[SPEAKER_00]: with being able to have a successful
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, we had to pivot at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we went from 156 producers on the
island to four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while those four producers are still
excellent, and we're proud of them in 502,
[SPEAKER_00]: that leaves 152 other families that had
their businesses crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pivoted to becoming more of a
patient and a patient and community
[SPEAKER_00]: outreach organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we host fantastic speakers meetings
that bring in people from all over where
[SPEAKER_00]: we talk about cannabis health and
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two points I wanted you to make sure
you get from this is, number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: look for a reason to pull people together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have an organization and the
growers didn't think they needed an
[SPEAKER_00]: organization until we thought about,
why don't we pull everybody together so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have more strength together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second, when the Washington State
bureaucracy killed our market,
[SPEAKER_00]: we pivoted to become patient outreach so
that we could still keep coming together
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep exerting influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the two things that I want to
point out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
