[SPEAKER_01]: So Rio, thank you so much for having us on
the farm today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the property is so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as everybody can see,
you know, you're on a, on a mountain top
[SPEAKER_01]: with 360 degree views.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great place to make a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet when you got here, it was not in
good shape, you know, old forested
[SPEAKER_01]: property with lots of heavy machinery and
yet you breathed life into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so let's start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it that you did to help restore
and regenerate the soil on the property?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the areas that we were farming had
been gone, had been logged and had been
[SPEAKER_00]: degraded by big machinery, like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were hard pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the soil was really like dried out when
you kind of run, when you run machine over
[SPEAKER_00]: and destroy all the biology in an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it becomes hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil pours closed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't absorb water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how to bring that, that from that
state back into a biological state,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you really need to sink carbon and
you really need to sink biology back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first is we designated our ag zones and
we started digging trenches, not deep
[SPEAKER_00]: trenches, but like two, three feet in some
areas, some areas where it was much more
[SPEAKER_00]: stable, deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started burying our forestry
products or our forestry thinnings from
[SPEAKER_00]: wildfire protection back into that,
those degraded areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would layer the hard pack with
compost, with forest thinnings,
[SPEAKER_00]: with wood chips, with any kind of
biological, with any kind of like plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you could find, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And develop these lasagna layers,
which now are like, you know, quite deep
[SPEAKER_00]: and spongy and absorb water and really
like are wonderful for growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the idea that, you know,
obviously there's wildfire issue here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it just seems rather intuitive to be
able to use all of the forest stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: the tree fall and all this stuff,
put it to good use rebuilding the soil in
[SPEAKER_01]: the same bio region, which also then
increases the safety of the farm itself
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and your neighbors, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in permaculture, it's stacking
functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wouldn't, I wasn't even thinking
this way years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I would import or buy soil
from the trucks and plastic bags and they
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up to be shipped in, harvested from
peat moss bogs, where it's like totally
[SPEAKER_00]: not sustainable practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more I learned, the more I
realized that all the resources I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow amazing products and cannabis on my
farm are already here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like biological diversity in a forest
with the IMOs, you know, indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms with rain meal chips,
with the different ushnia hanging from the
[SPEAKER_00]: oak leaves, the herbs, the fungus,
the grasses, it's all already existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that diversity is the strength of a
system, a biological system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of mimicking my 72 acres in
my garden areas and trying to mimic the
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity of a forest system is what
I'm trying to do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the fact too that you didn't bring
in all of the soil products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we talk a lot on shaping fire
about bio regionalism of microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might have a microbe from Alaska
that's used to an entirely different
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it does great in Alaska,
but it doesn't do great here, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But by, by wild crafting your inputs here
on your property, you're really just
[SPEAKER_01]: moving the microbes around on your
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, they're, they're used to thriving
in, in your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you don't have to like move all
this biology here, have it crash and then
[SPEAKER_01]: rebuild it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're skipping, you know,
that die-off step by using all of your own
[SPEAKER_01]: forested stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: For, I mean, for instance, like we do the
forest thing and then we woodchip and we
[SPEAKER_00]: collect those wood chips and we line all
our paths with the wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then over winter, the
microorganisms that were already in this
[SPEAKER_00]: area are growing in our paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we brew a tea now,
we just go on our paths and we dig up the
[SPEAKER_00]: white molds and the microorganisms in
those paths and just add it to the tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's, it changes the smell of
the tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really like, it adds a lot of strength
to the systems that are already in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great thing to be able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I make, I brew tea too,
but you know, I'm, I'm using this person
[SPEAKER_01]: or that person's blend, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I purchased, which, you know,
since, you know, I live on Bachelon
[SPEAKER_01]: Island, but you know, I live really close
to Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of rural city, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're very much out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're being able to target the
specific microbes you want just by
[SPEAKER_01]: producing them on the island and then
using the brewing of the tea to
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially super concentrate them and
then feed them back to themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a scientist, but just by
experience, it's working really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, from the plants that I hear,
I mean, we're early in the season here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the plants that I saw were already
jumping ahead that, you know, nobody was,
[SPEAKER_01]: looked like they were shocked at all from
being transplanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's like, you know, up and going
appropriately for this time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I found interesting
was, you know, I'll tour some farms and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll use, you know, some wood chip
mulch or, or they, they might have a hugel
[SPEAKER_01]: or more, but you have deployed wood and
parts of trees everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is clearly the, the number one input
that I've experienced from touring today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would think that that has to do with
two, for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, you live in a forest and so
it's a resource you've got a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also you talk a lot about preserving
water here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so you really seem to be using
that wood for its, its, its, its sponge
[SPEAKER_01]: capabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you tell us a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause water is clearly so dire here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just like I was saying,
it's a, can the earth absorb rain and
[SPEAKER_00]: where does it go once it's absorbed and
how, what trees are thriving and where's
[SPEAKER_00]: the runoff going?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so getting ground cover on,
on every area that I can, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it starts microbiology going so
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, any place that I put wood chips,
worms show up within a month or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I put wood chips on the
fruit trees and they're thriving and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're retaining water and it just holds
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So building swales and then laying wood
chips in the swale and then, and even,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then wood chipping just any,
in any area that is open is, is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the biology of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil starts opening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the life that it brings and
there's different wood chips, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardier wood from the tree is going to
take a lot longer to, to, to break down
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the ramiel chips from the leaves
and the branches is almost, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: available much quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is ramiel a tree species?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just the smaller branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the fingers, the outer edges of
the new growth and it's more biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: active and ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, it's softer wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why people will, I guess,
use the green parts when they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a fermentation or something,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's more biologically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to bury all, all types of stuff
into our hoogles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just then we have stuff that's breaking
down a little slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people are worried about the
nitrogen, like pulling nitrogen out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants, but there's so, if you get
the biology right and you get living soils
[SPEAKER_00]: active, it's breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And producing at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't see that that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a key to the making the
jump from, I'm adding nutrients to feed my
[SPEAKER_01]: plant versus us being soil farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actually trying to, you know,
keep a healthy rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so long as we keep the soil healthy,
the plant will be fine.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're used to pouring nutrients on it
because it needs nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm used to, that's how I grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this plant needs nitrogen,
but that's because we were buying soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that everything was spent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was no worms in your bag
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no, you know, you could open up
the soil here and there's so many bugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: different things happening that are,
from what I've learned from Elaine Ingram
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Dragonfly Earth Medicine cohorts,
is that it's just pulling nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something to pull it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I guess there's different,
different metaphors for it, but like the
[SPEAKER_00]: super market, like, you know, there's all
these products in the supermarket,
[SPEAKER_00]: but until you have a living system,
the doors are shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open the doors and then all of a
sudden you're like, Whoa, those are
[SPEAKER_01]: already in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with your, you know, we've walked this
property for a while today and just like
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the, the insects that we're hearing
right now, as you move in different height
[SPEAKER_01]: of your property and then you're more ag
land versus you're more hard packed,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, housing areas and where
you keep your equipment, we're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: running into different sounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a melody of different types of
beetles and crickets and whatever you have
[SPEAKER_01]: up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that kind of diversity,
you want to model that in the soil just as
[SPEAKER_01]: much, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there, there's different systems,
like the Hoogles down below had much more
[SPEAKER_00]: forest products in them than the stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has more annual and more,
we just work this more.
[SPEAKER_00]: From our compost, from our house and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are microclimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like warmer on that side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of like in Benbow, there's a
river on the north of us and a river on
[SPEAKER_00]: the Southwest of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're this island farm kind of,
if you, if you're driving on the freeway,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see just the mountain that we're on
and we're literally the whole top of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this island.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of have these crazy swirling
wind patterns and a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we had talked about
earlier was, you know, the need to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to slow down the water that's passing by
because, you know, for a lot of folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: are, who are lower down the mountain,
there are, there are, there are,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are springs and there's rainfall and
one way or another, the water comes down
[SPEAKER_01]: the mountain and, and different people can
use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, not only are you at the top
of the mountain, but regulations in
[SPEAKER_01]: California have changed a lot now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, so that most people can't use
naturally occurring springs on their
[SPEAKER_01]: property or just above their property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for you, there is no just above your
property, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so if you would explain a little bit
about how you are trying to sink the water
[SPEAKER_01]: here instead of letting any of it kind of
move on past you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is an ideal, like if you're
studying land that's productive,
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of the mountain would not be the
spot you would want because usually silt
[SPEAKER_00]: would run off the mountain and gather in
the valleys and most ag lands in the
[SPEAKER_00]: valleys and water starts pouring out of
the side of the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're at the top of the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily we have 72 acres and we have a
whole Northern watershed area to it for
[SPEAKER_00]: our domestic use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis regulations make us store
everything and only use rain catchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've developed a series of three ponds
where all of our greenhouses flow,
[SPEAKER_00]: the roof catchment from our greenhouses
and our sheds and my father's house all
[SPEAKER_00]: flow into those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we siphon off that into our
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have like 700,000 gallons in rain
catchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more than that is even on this space
and this is about six acres of top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hill and which has hills and flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many things we can do to store,
to sink, to divert, to capture water on
[SPEAKER_00]: this six acres as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't really done as much as we
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still roads and we still do get
run off, but we're much better than we
[SPEAKER_01]: were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about a couple of those
strategies, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that not only do a lot of
different kinds of farmers have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: creative when it comes to creating and
preserving water on their property,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also as everybody starts to get drier,
waters have become more valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the couple of the strategies that
you've used on the property to sink the
[SPEAKER_01]: water and to keep it here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll get you started.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that I thought that was especially
cool was as we were walking down the road,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, oh, we're going to put
catchment to spread the natural road rot
[SPEAKER_01]: off to the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you start there and then just
kind of tell us anything else along those
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like road is a perfect example of
something that creates a runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you wouldn't find a road in a forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the water that falls around a
tree is, like I said, the pores in a
[SPEAKER_00]: forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the mulch is there, the wood chips are
there, the grass and all those soil pores
[SPEAKER_00]: are open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a road, we're driving on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've killed all the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're steep in parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the water just runs downhill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Department of Fish and Wildlife and
all the regulations have forced us farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: to really limit road runoff, which has
been an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the politics are a little damaging
on the other side, but the regulations I
[SPEAKER_00]: totally agree on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've created swales in all of our
roads every 40 to 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The road is 60 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the road runoff will stop,
cross the road and ditch into the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our whole road system all the way
down to the bottom last summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: we created these swale systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no more like really intense
road ditching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made much less work for me in that,
you know, accounting for that where every
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce of that water is going to go with
those swale systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does stop road erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the forest around there is now
capturing wherever that pitches off into
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest, that's going to capture that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, it's like I was saying,
like just watch it in the rain storms,
[SPEAKER_00]: see where the water is and see where
there's little zones where maybe you can
[SPEAKER_00]: make a water retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like building ponds, but building
water retention zones where you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to store a lot of water,
but you're using your land as the storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just create a little like a
swale that looks like a horseshoe and then
[SPEAKER_00]: water just sits there for a day or two and
then sinks in, you've created a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch more water retention for everything
under that zone or even around that zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You seem to really, I mean, your dad lives
here, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's got this gorgeous garden,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bursting with color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, you're really into
polyculture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got plants alongside and inside
your beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got all sorts of, you know,
herbal medicine, botanicals, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, you know, lining your beds,
lining the road, just kind of everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would seem to me that all these
additional plantings, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just act as a big sponge and create this
freeway down for the water that you hold
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me a little bit about like the amount
of effort it was for you to add all this
[SPEAKER_01]: polyculture because, you know,
anybody who's probably following this
[SPEAKER_01]: channel realizes that we're all like,
you know, pro polyculture and growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis all on its own, monoculture is
just like not really all that positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people think that they can't
do it because it's like it takes so much
[SPEAKER_01]: effort just to grow the cannabis that I
don't have enough time to do all these
[SPEAKER_01]: other plantings and yet you've got them
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, how much labor did that add
to your season to be able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: add this crop variety, but also water
sinks?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I couldn't do it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a team is very important and a
team that knows like, I'm not fully,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an herbalist or I don't know all
the plant varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a team and we talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sit around the fire and we say,
hey, what if we did this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we did that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that what I've learned is
timing is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as I cut my cannabis,
I'm throwing out cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I cover, you know,
in the early spring, I'm throwing
[SPEAKER_00]: wildflower seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, that's like my favorite job is to
literally just have a bucket and go out at
[SPEAKER_00]: the right time, judging on weather and
just throw seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just try to throw seed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do, I have a nursery where I
propagate, you know, plants and plugging
[SPEAKER_00]: them in here and there on the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really extra labor in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've definitely killed a lot of plants
by putting them at the wrong time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think timing is the biggest learning
curve on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I thought was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, when you're referring to this
nursery, you're talking about the one made
[SPEAKER_01]: out of all reclaimed materials,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was pretty cool too,
because, you know, I can see this theme
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of running throughout your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all like, all right, how diverse,
how can I bring diversity as a solution to
[SPEAKER_01]: each of these challenges that I've got?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how can I expand the productivity of
my land trying to keep my, resource
[SPEAKER_01]: footprint small and using what's here,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we saw your nursery,
I mean, it was cool to go in and to see
[SPEAKER_01]: all the healthy plants rocking along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, oh yeah,
this was from somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was from somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, did you find that it was
challenging to source the secondhand
[SPEAKER_01]: material?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it actually made it more laborious?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you find that actually when you
shift your expectations to reclaiming
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, that it just kind of is everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the ladder for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I mean, there's resources
everywhere and adjusting your design to
[SPEAKER_00]: fit your resources is part of that plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you might want a fully framed metal
greenhouse, but this has actually worked
[SPEAKER_00]: much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have reclaimed glass from, I think a
guy in Eureka had a whole pile of glass I
[SPEAKER_00]: still have like 50 sheets of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made glass windows out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the redwood was from an old barn
over in West Haven, you know, by the
[SPEAKER_00]: coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just rotting in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we picked that up for a huge,
like almost a whole barn for like three
[SPEAKER_00]: grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this huge stack of old growth
redwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just keep using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still using it like four years
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that idea you've got of not forcing
the solution to necessarily be the,
[SPEAKER_01]: not forcing the solution to the problem or
to the challenge to be the one that you
[SPEAKER_01]: expect it to be, but instead kind of hold
space with the challenge and then look
[SPEAKER_01]: around you for what your natural
environment might suggest as a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could learn from that myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we all could, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like permaculture or it's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if you are attentive to what's
in front of you and you're in the moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: then ideas just flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'd like to be well
planned, but like gardening, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to, the best gardening tool is
farmer's shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just showing up up here and being here,
these designs come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've always wanted to have like a
full scale permaculture plan for my whole
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we start jiving and talking and
we end up doing something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's been much more creative
doing it the latter way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think both are important because then
the planning process brings in more
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtful solutions and you can go back
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but forcing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing I've learned from talking
to permaculture people too, is that your
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture plan, I mean, unless you're
doing it for a client, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But really a permaculture plan is never
finished because as soon as you're done,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, oh, all right, this is
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you learn some more stuff and
you're like, all right, now you're
[SPEAKER_01]: changing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's why people enjoy
living like you're living is because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: an, it's an active exercise in artistry
with nature, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like constantly evolving and
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as you make your map,
you're going to be changing your map
[SPEAKER_01]: probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ever changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you get out here and you
get inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where my dad is a carpenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he just ends up building little sheds
all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He built this little like, um,
collective kitchen for the workers on a
[SPEAKER_00]: trailer or, uh, Lizzie, his, his
girlfriend, she's just like a wild
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she sees a place that needs a rose or a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll just stick a rose in the forest
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, uh, you know,
you, I, I mean, part of it, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: like be productive and stay in business,
which I guess that's my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody else just kind of,
you know, everyone else in the family has
[SPEAKER_00]: much more like creative freedom to like
think that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that interplay though that,
that really just brings home the
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of family based heritage
cannabis farms everywhere, but
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically here in the Emerald triangle,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's a, you know, the,
the, the ornamental and food gardens and
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, adds to the poly culture
and the fact that you've got family here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helps keep you feel alive and passionate,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The, um, the ecosystem of people who are
up here working on it is very unlike what
[SPEAKER_01]: I see in some of the valleys when they are
setting up, um, you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate cannabis monocultures,
which can be interesting in their own
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually it's because people are
explaining some kind of new to new cool
[SPEAKER_01]: technology or, or mechanism, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like that can be cool, but,
but honestly, you know, dirt on the boots
[SPEAKER_01]: is a pretty great mechanism and just
having all your family here is good too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the homesteaders moved out to this
land before there was cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a back to the land movement
that was anti corporate, uh, anti war,
[SPEAKER_00]: anti industrial, like, and the beauty that
that life created for me when I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: child, um, of just like having this
collective vision of hundreds and hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of people, um, that wanted to live
organically and and free and having,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, less, less, less rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that created so much beauty
that, um, that's kind of what we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to fight for in the whole craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis movement is like, yeah,
cannabis is important, but when it's who
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoke it with and where you're smoking
and the truth that it brings out,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's much more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so one of the things I love when I,
when I get to tour, um, cannabis property
[SPEAKER_01]: farms is that every now and then I'll come
across something that I've never seen
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets me really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw such a thing today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, so I saw your crater garden,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to be talking about this for
weeks, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, if I understand it
correctly, essentially, um, you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you dug out an area, uh, in order to
create windbreaks for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you took all the stones that you've
been finding on your property and have
[SPEAKER_01]: been making terraces of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is that, um, uh, the sun
beats on them all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are absorbing the, the warmth,
which extends the length of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, was that your idea when you built
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just creates a really hot
microclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can protect the wind and a
horseshoe pattern and then the rocks act
[SPEAKER_00]: as like a moisture, it pulls moisture in
when, or when it's hot, it pulls moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's cold, it kind of keeps
moisture in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll actually mulch some of the grapes
and some of the hotter weather plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and this little zone is in a very like
warmer part of our property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the sativas that are more
equatorial are going to go there and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see if they thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, we are, we're kind of in
this banana belt of Humboldt up at 1700
[SPEAKER_00]: feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't get the fog in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fog will roll in right below our
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, and in that crater garden,
it's still going to be hot in October,
[SPEAKER_00]: November.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first side note, it must be gorgeous
when the clouds are below you and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see that sometime,
but, but also, um, did you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how did the crater garden come about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have these, these, you know,
these equatorial and Afghan, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: not African sativas that you wanted to
give them their best chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you built.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crater garden for them, or did you
hear about a crater garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I'll make that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll find something to plant in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it came about how we were
talking about before, like some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: workers, I like just don't tell them what
to do sometimes that are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of, one of my workers just like
started building a crater garden and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, Oh man, this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This identified what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he actually ended up not
finishing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lizzie came in and she started
developing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it really just grew organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were talking about, like it's been
a community effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just before you came here,
it really got together with tying it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the other garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we like, we're like, Oh my God,
this is like, this crater garden is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be perfect for sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started building, we built some wood
sheds and put our tanks like right above
[SPEAKER_00]: it to act as a one break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to plant some more
hedgerows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perennials and trees above it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea just kind of developed from
being up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Sepp Holzer is one of my gurus of
permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wrote a book where he was growing
bananas in the, at like 5,000 feet in
[SPEAKER_00]: Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he found a black rock on his
property, um, right in a zone that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get any wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he would plant banana trees right
in that little zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he built the little greenhouse
and the snow to like make it last through
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the summer he was pulling bananas
out of 5,000 feet in Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so in that same vein of like,
you know, a rare crop in a rare place,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've built this gorgeous crater garden
that looks cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it handles moisture well, and it's
going to be warmer for longer than the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you planning there this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like, like that's a special place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like an altar in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you, what are you, what are you
going to grow there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's, it's, it's a smallish area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to grow this strain,
uh, which is a lady Africa, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a Shashimani cross with cherry
pie with, uh, um, forbidden fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is tangy cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to put some of that and
the sweet pink, um, is a sativa that I
[SPEAKER_00]: also source from a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that probably is going to go there
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did used to have Columbia gold and the
Acapulco gold, and I have some rare seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, but I didn't start those because I had
an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't come to fruition, but so any of
our more nominous sativas, and then we do
[SPEAKER_00]: have wine grapes and eating grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, it's just dawned on me that this is
a crater garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That now you're going to have to,
and now you're going to have to plant it
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, the, the, the, the strain you
mentioned was, um, Lady Africa and the
[SPEAKER_01]: name of your farm is Lady Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so am I correct to suggest that you
made this cross here yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just like Bob Dylan, like does
anybody have complete authority over what
[SPEAKER_00]: they make?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I have friends that brought me
seeds and I crossed, um, some of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my friends crossed the Lady Africa
or the Shashimani with cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I cross it with forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I learned the genetic background of
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I'm going with this is, is the fact
that, that particular cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the bio regionalism of them is really
important, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, even though you are
bringing land races in from Africa via
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, once, once, once it got here,
you started doing large scale sifts on
[SPEAKER_01]: your own property in your own soil to see
which, which chemo bars we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: love where you live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you chose phenos to plant this
year based on, on your local area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and I think that that's probably
going to become increasingly popular,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As, as most of the industry moves to
commoditize cannabis, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got one hip strain that happens to
be, you know, mentioned in the magazine
[SPEAKER_01]: and then everybody wants that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, you know, for the,
for, for, for general buying public,
[SPEAKER_01]: that might be legitimate for, for people
like you that are like very seriously
[SPEAKER_01]: craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, um, you know, the things
that you're growing on your farm that
[SPEAKER_01]: tastes unique because it's been grown in
your soil is going to become more
[SPEAKER_01]: prevalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm guessing that you agree with that
because we saw your, your, your seeded
[SPEAKER_01]: light depth, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're producing your own seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, would you tell us a little bit about
the importance for you for producing your
[SPEAKER_01]: own seed, um, and, and why it's important
to do it on your own property?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the whole process is so exciting,
um, is to plant your whole land and then
[SPEAKER_00]: go out and find the plant that's thriving
the most, find the smells, find,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you have your mail garden and
you're pulling the ones that aren't what
[SPEAKER_00]: you want and checking the structure and
smelling the turps and then thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: going home and like waking up at two in
the morning going, Oh my God, I should do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I breed like the old school way where I
just have a mail garden on another part of
[SPEAKER_00]: my property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go and I select out the plants
that I love most and that are doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: best in my, on my land and then cross
those with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just the constant selection of
like what's, what's, what's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I make enough crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, I make so many,
I'll probably do 50 different seed types
[SPEAKER_00]: per year or even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, and then mark them and then
go back and taste the flower and smell it
[SPEAKER_00]: as it's getting harvested and like have
mental notes of which one was the right
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next year I go, Oh, I'm going to
do that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, uh, really a joy to go
through a greenhouse during a sift when
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants are allowed to grow taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like sometimes if you're going to
do a huge sift, they need to stay small
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, and you can't really see their
full adult expression, but these light
[SPEAKER_01]: depth seeded plants are, you know,
are coming up to our shoulders now and to
[SPEAKER_01]: see, you know, a whole line of them that
came from the same folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, you know, this one's got this,
you know, deep purple, but it's only
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath the leaves and they're all,
they're all expressing themselves in
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, for those of us who really
love the plant, um, that's really cool to
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, so that we can all kind of share
in, in your joy on this or, or nerdiness,
[SPEAKER_01]: how we want to look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are a couple of, where are some of
the crosses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just give us like, you know,
two or three that you are most excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the one we're talking about is the
Pure Kush Lime Pop from Mean Gene and
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which I grew, I've grown a few times
and it's just all an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cross with Fruit Loops from
Huckleberry Hill Farms up here in Humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm taking my favorite from one region,
crossing it with my favorite from this
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two together hasn't been done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that I'm super excited about that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what are some of the other ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, that Lady Africa Forbidden Fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I feel like that one's really going to
come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I did do a CBD cross last year or the
year before, which I call Lady Benbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, uh, um, Lion's Quibbit,
which is, uh, Gunganetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's at a Palm Springs, but it's like
a Spanish variety of CBD cross with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, another Mean Gene strain, which was
Pina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the Pina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that Lion's Quibbit has like
this Mersenne Deep Purple and the Pina is
[SPEAKER_00]: much more fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you smelled that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that's been a really fun strain
because it does so good around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never gets mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, uh, it likes this dry
climate, but it, uh, it, with the Humble
[SPEAKER_00]: climate, it's like the buds are stacked
hard and like full of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the CBD plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I have so many crosses that I
didn't plant this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I found interesting
is as we went through the different
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens, um, you had a lot of crosses with
names that I was not familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's not like I go deep into
the history of crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I usually interview people who
are far more expert than that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but, but what you kept on saying is
like, oh, I got this from this farm or I
[SPEAKER_01]: got this from this farm or this is,
this is, oh, this is his reserved seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it kind of gave me a look inside
of, uh, the farmer to farmer trading of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and, and certainly there are seed
swaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but what I was kind of picking up
from you was way more informal and like
[SPEAKER_01]: way more family to family almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what can you say about the importance
of cannabis farmers within a bio region
[SPEAKER_01]: trading seeds outside of commerce?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the whole history of our,
of our community here is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're, uh, anti commercial even some of
the best, I mean, most of the best things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've received have come through that
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have the green lantern this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm planting 70 plants of green
lantern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't pay for those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're probably worth,
you know, hundreds and hundreds of dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even get those seeds,
but the person that, um, and that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Cup winner from Ridgeline who got
it from the same guy that I got it from,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he just like my worker is one of his
best friends and that's how they treat we
[SPEAKER_00]: trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing within this
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I don't need to buy anything
from anybody really, because I get,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, inspiring conversations and I get
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get, uh, I mean, yes, we have a
commerce, but I just think that the craft
[SPEAKER_00]: movement is going to be defined by the
community that holds it tight and talks
[SPEAKER_00]: and comes to the meetings and really
builds this non commerce network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best things I get are from that
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for inviting me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: To come and check out your community and
meet some of your people and meet your
[SPEAKER_01]: ladies that are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate both, uh,
you opening yourselves up and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also the teaching that you shared with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate meeting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
Thank you.
