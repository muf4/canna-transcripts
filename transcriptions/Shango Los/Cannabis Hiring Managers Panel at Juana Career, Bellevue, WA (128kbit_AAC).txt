[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here we are at the moderated
panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that you are all here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the panel that we are having today is
to give you a chance to access the brains
[SPEAKER_02]: of people who own cannabis companies and
also one who is a serial applicant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can learn by his best practices,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll remember from the keynote that I
gave an hour ago that we were talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about getting in contact with the
visionaries, the people who started the
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an opportunity to be able to
pick their brains and hear what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, let's introduce our
wonderfully friendly and informal panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first we've got Jenadiah Haney who is
founder of Evergreen Industries SPC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also worked all over the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got a lot of very unique
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next is Jeremy Kaufman who is founder and
president of the CPC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next to him is Tyler Marquardt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were joking because he is again
officially not with the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has had more legitimate cannabis jobs
than anybody that I know in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know it says something to his
ability to keep or it says something to
[SPEAKER_02]: his ability to get jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what it doesn't show is the company's
ability to keep him entertained.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the way at the end we've got
Brett Frazier who is the Harvest Trim
[SPEAKER_02]: Manager from New Leaf that you may know
more as Donald Oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's going to be speaking from the
processor position.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like what people are thinking
about when they're hiring for processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way that this is going to work is
I've got a couple starter questions to get
[SPEAKER_02]: us going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get, you know, we'll heat up 45
minutes really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll go through those questions
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will give them a chance to say,
you know, what they want to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also for you to understand a little
bit about where each of them is coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll open up for questions so
that you can get anything we haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: covered covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start on the far end with Brett.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the same question to all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which cannabis skills are important to
include on your resume and what skills are
[SPEAKER_02]: important to your specific part of the
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like that question because a lot of
people will come in for an interview or a
[SPEAKER_01]: job and they'll say, I have no experience
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they feel like that's a defeating
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all developing new ways and methods
to do everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes the things you may have known
or you've seen or think that are required,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not required at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of the processing and a lot of
the harvesting of all the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do appreciate people that have worked
with plants or do have some trimming
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, but it's not necessarily,
you know, it's not a deal breaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have developed a system at Dama where we
do trimming probably a lot different than
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of other companies with a lot fewer
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I almost sometimes prefer people to
have no experience because then I can
[SPEAKER_01]: train you to do it our way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that our way is a great way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll make it easier than coming in
with maybe a preconceived notion of what
[SPEAKER_01]: would you think is expected and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as a resume goes, when I'm
looking at resume, I'm looking at,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love history, consistent work,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the main thing that I look for at
Dama is, you know, we're a small company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're 35 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to see you guys more than I'm
going to see my own family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can I get along with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we interact?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys, you know, a team player?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you highly motivated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, I came in and started
as a, as basically a temporary trimmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through two and a half years on my way
up to be a part of the management team,
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets to decide the direction of the
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets to decide the different things
that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what's so amazing about this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growing and it's growing really,
really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're always looking to identify
people that have special skills that will
[SPEAKER_01]: help us, you know, come and develop new
processes and new products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that I find really
important is making your resume creative
[SPEAKER_06]: or unique to everybody else's.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can be a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can be a grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are a lot of trimmers and there
are a lot of growers out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to make yourself a little bit
more unique.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what makes your style good?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what makes you, are you open to being
trained and willing to do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of resumes can show that just by
visually putting out there like different
[SPEAKER_06]: types of jobs we've done.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you've consistently done the
same job over and over and over again,
[SPEAKER_06]: then you need to be unique in saying,
oh, I'm very consistent at being able to
[SPEAKER_06]: do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're not, for instance,
like I myself, I have a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_06]: things that I can tackle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you have to make sure that you can
apply that and have them read it
[SPEAKER_06]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just making yourself available to the
employers really important and showing
[SPEAKER_06]: them that you're flexible in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of you, honestly,
will come from an area where there isn't a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of like, oh, yeah, I've been growing
for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, well, what's your growing experience?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't have any pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any weed from 20 years ago to
show you and all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need to be creative about these
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to start, you know, taking notes
about what you're doing and being able to
[SPEAKER_06]: show people with kind of like a book or,
you know, cover like in your cover letter,
[SPEAKER_06]: like Shanga was saying earlier,
being able to explain to the employers
[SPEAKER_06]: what you're good at doing and how you can
be flexible in those aspects.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're making yourself stand above
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to make sure that you do stand
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how are you going to do that with a
piece of paper when everybody's piece of
[SPEAKER_06]: paper looks exactly the same?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where I would probably put that
into is dialing it in to whatever it is
[SPEAKER_06]: that you do have to add there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it creative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it stand out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you are a tremor,
why are you the better tremor than
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody else?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to second what they said that
really, thank you, I'm loud in general.
Really, I mean, like I said, you go
through and see your resumes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, for me, it is you're looking
for something to stand out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as much as this is probably not akin
to the question, the resume is actually
[SPEAKER_07]: not where you stand out.
[SPEAKER_07]: For a person like me, where we have two
retail shops and I'm constantly getting
[SPEAKER_07]: emailed, to a certain extent, the resumes
almost don't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to say that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was actually what I had in my
professional career before I came into
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You couldn't just email a resume to Google
or Yahoo or Amazon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I literally had to drive down to Amazon's
headquarters and sit in front of HR and
[SPEAKER_07]: throw paper at them until somebody was
actually willing to give me an interview.
[SPEAKER_07]: So really, it was how tenacious are you
about getting that document in front of
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just like coming to an event like
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really key.
[SPEAKER_07]: As we're opening in about four months,
but the concept for me today, I've met
[SPEAKER_07]: people that I'm already lining up for
spots.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you meet somebody, you get a feel for
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Team building, that is key.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you fit with the people we already
have?
[SPEAKER_07]: To a certain extent, that resume is make
it pink, spray it with perfume,
[SPEAKER_09]: mail it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't actually send it through an email.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually send a letter, even though stamps
are about 47 cents now.
[SPEAKER_07]: That really is it.
[SPEAKER_07]: For something like me, I am looking for
somebody who shows that passion.
[SPEAKER_07]: For this industry, and just so you guys
understand, if you don't have a passion
[SPEAKER_07]: for this, it's going to be interesting to
kind of get through this as much as I want
[SPEAKER_07]: to tell you right now that everything is
stable and that you do have careers in
[SPEAKER_07]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've made a career.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody here has made a career in this
industry, but it is still federally legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be a dynamic person.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be able to work with that
team.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just sort of, like I said,
be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with those resumes, make sure that
they are very, very staunchly different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make them like cut it out in stars.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a memory.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to make an impression.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is as much as it's worth.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't help with the resume to a
certain extent, but if you are creative,
[SPEAKER_07]: as I'm talking about, you will find a way
to make an impression.
[SPEAKER_07]: You will find a way to get an interview
from that specific job.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Evergreen Industries, SBC, is a hemp
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: We focus on renationalizing the hemp
industries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're located in Yakima.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a startup.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about a year old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like with most startups, we focus on
pretty much financing the business to go
[SPEAKER_05]: forward with our future vision.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why I say that is I'm a little bit
different than the rest of the crowd on
[SPEAKER_05]: the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp Industries is struggling.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just kind of finding some licensure
in this next couple of years with the
[SPEAKER_05]: WSDA.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pretty fun experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to pay the bills, I do revolve in the
medicinal and recreational sectors now
[SPEAKER_05]: collided.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a, I would say, serial startup junkie.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a lot of things to moonlight
those practices.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've bartended.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've started nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just done consulting on the side in
general.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, oh, and events.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to do events.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we actually all interact in that
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are things that you have to take
a dynamic approach because you have this
[SPEAKER_05]: vision.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if your vision isn't like,
I want a hemp company.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, I want to be in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the end all point that I'm going
to put there is passion, being part of
[SPEAKER_05]: that team, but also perseverance.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see a lot of different types of people
come up to us to interact in our networks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you pretty much can judge that rather
quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going to be around in a year?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the shifting sands are rather
quick and violent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to take a little bit of
extra tenacity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I look for when I look to
build a team on anything, whether it's an
[SPEAKER_05]: event, a nonprofit, endeavor, a crazy
march on the capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see some familiar faces in the crowd and
really appreciate you all for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just the basic end all for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really look for people that are going to
help me carry that same passion forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give that to Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to need a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to take a second and point out
on how I did not plan this, but how
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome this just reinforced everything I
just said in my keynote.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Brett on the end, he said he started as
a trimmer doing nothing and in two and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half years, he's running the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then Ty, Ty's all like, you've got to be
flexible and be willing to wear many hats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Jeremy's all like, dude,
I'm running the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have time for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to make something to make your
resume stand out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Jen's all like, you got to have
follow through if you want to make
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself be heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just made all my points and this is
what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to hit one more thing while
we're at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jeremy, I'm going to put you on the hot
seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jeremy is a perfect example of the guy
that I was talking about as the principal,
[SPEAKER_02]: the visionary, the guy who started the
company on sheer passion because he had a
[SPEAKER_02]: dream he was going to make it real through
his tenacity, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I was saying about you and all
of those who are visionaries like you is
[SPEAKER_02]: that when folks write a resume cover
letter and they write it authentically
[SPEAKER_02]: from their heart and they say why they
like your company, what you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: right, and what they can do to help you do
more of that, that that can just cause you
[SPEAKER_02]: to like shove all your resumes to the side
and go with that one person because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not getting the same kind of BS cover
letter stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're letting their humanness come
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a visionary, you're eating that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that accurate for you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that is incredibly accurate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And almost in the history,
[SPEAKER_07]: and actually that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what I was kind of saying earlier
that I've seen so many resumes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We opened the CBC in 2009, and I've been
getting resumes since then.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really what you're looking for is that
passion.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't want to explicitly say that in
the first answer because I was trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: keep it about the resumes.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that is really it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it was Todd or actually it was
Brett maybe that said that you can train
[SPEAKER_07]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's really it that I look.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's been really fascinating about this
event is that I've actually met 8.8 out of
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 people that I've met today have
experience outside the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_07]: which for me almost these days,
I'm more looking for.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking for those skill sets that
exist in standardized industries,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether you're running the retail side of
things, the production side of things,
[SPEAKER_07]: the processing side of things,
the marketing and distro side of things,
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever side that you're running.
[SPEAKER_07]: That skill set, a lot of people grew up in
cannabis, didn't get the ability to
[SPEAKER_07]: develop those skills elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I'm reading that cover letter,
I'm looking for that perfect intersection
[SPEAKER_07]: between the fact that I am deeply
passionate about this industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to beat around the bush.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love what I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm passionate about helping people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis has changed my life, but I've
been in this industry for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not other than the fact that some
days you're just chewing down blood.
You got to be ready for it.
But that's it.
This is the most fascinating industry in
the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I'm reading these resumes,
I'm looking for somebody in that 19
[SPEAKER_07]: sentences can you find those words when
I'm reading, they remind me of myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: They remind me of the passion and the
drive and the commitment that I had to
[SPEAKER_07]: doing this, which allowed me to actually
deal with all the change that Jed was
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: There isn't a single 30 day period in this
industry in the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't been deeply different than the
previous 30 days or the next 30 days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And finding people, because that's the
thing, you could have banking experience,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can have all this other experience,
but the reality being is if you don't have
[SPEAKER_07]: the actual sinews in your body to
withstand what cannabis is going to put
[SPEAKER_07]: you against, it's hard for me to hire you
at this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can be the most skilled individual in
the world, but if you don't have that part
[SPEAKER_07]: in you that's going to allow you to deal
with the burgeoning industry, dealing with
[SPEAKER_07]: legislation, dealing with the fact that
it's so federally illegal, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_07]: have a hard time even if you're the most
skilled individual for this specific spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will, as my specific position,
lean towards somebody that is much more
[SPEAKER_07]: akin with the ethos of the company,
much more akin with what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: do long term with the business.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's much easier to develop than
somebody who, like we were talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: earlier, that if you've just been doing
the same, if you've been trimming for 20
[SPEAKER_07]: years, sometimes that's actually a
detriment because it's even harder to get
[SPEAKER_07]: you onto our method because there's just
burgeoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go back from Jed and go
this way this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing, if you missed my keynote
that I did an hour ago, we will be posting
[SPEAKER_02]: it online probably starting from my
Facebook page at Facebook forward slash my
[SPEAKER_02]: name, Shango Los, hopefully in 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you missed it, hopefully you'll be
able to see it on video there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so Jed, I know you didn't get
to see the questions in advance,
[SPEAKER_02]: so this is kind of like Jeopardy for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is one thing an applicant can do
to make the job of the hiring manager
[SPEAKER_02]: easier?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'm going to answer this as
the perspective of an applicant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I expressed earlier,
you know, I've done a lot of things to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep my startup businesses alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recently I've looked at interfacing
between producer processors and retailers
[SPEAKER_05]: and doing some stuff in the retail sector.
[SPEAKER_05]: To gather more information, and this is
just something I've tended to do generally
[SPEAKER_05]: in my endeavors in startup businesses,
is I'll just dive right in, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: ground floor level and learn about that
specific industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was going into organic produce,
for example, I went and started working at
[SPEAKER_05]: the restaurants I wanted to supply.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to see exactly what that expo
line was like, what fresh herb and
[SPEAKER_05]: vegetables they wanted on those dishes,
when and how they were delivered,
[SPEAKER_05]: and what pains and sufferings were
involved in that process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a big thing to chew off,
but, you know, I learned a lot more than I
[SPEAKER_05]: think that anybody could ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then putting that into a business
plan, taking that into perseverance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in that time I've had, man,
probably six to nine jobs.
[SPEAKER_05]: More recently I even applied at one of the
more well-known retailers in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to really humble myself because
first and foremost I'm like a bulldog in a
[SPEAKER_05]: china shop, or a bull in a china shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also march those sayings.
[SPEAKER_05]: A bull in a china shop, as they say.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to just, you know, like obviously
take ownership of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: random sayings and just make them mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I have to, you know, I had to
really step back and put myself in their
[SPEAKER_05]: shoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember walking out of that
interview going, oh my god, I can't
[SPEAKER_05]: believe I answered some of those questions
the way I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was a really good, refreshing
experience for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: My company is now finally starting to take
off, and I think that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about to launch more in Yakima,
potentially a retail front in Yakima.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big things happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yakima is going to be the epicenter of not
just, I think, cannabis production in the
[SPEAKER_05]: future, but specifically industrial
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now I'm actually really excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a good opportunity for me to take
another quick look at, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: hiring, HR practices.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've worked with a lot of different
companies in the cannabis sector,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of different people on the ground
floor level.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's all time that we just take a
step back and realize that no matter what
[SPEAKER_05]: position we're in, we're stewards of a
brand new industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's watching us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether or not we're in the community,
not at work, and somebody just knows that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're in the cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if we're in work specifically,
we need a lead from, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_05]: lead by example.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had some pretty negative experiences,
to be honest, with some new cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: employers, whether it be in the consulting
side of that or in actually employment
[SPEAKER_05]: with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them was recently my brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Family is family, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, that was a big thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and to that, I had to, you know,
I had to basically interview with my
[SPEAKER_05]: brother and his partners.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's just a really,
it was a refreshing point.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to sum up, I think basically,
you know, to compliment what Jeremy said,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, to put what you are good at in
there, it doesn't all have to be about
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: To Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jeremy, I'm gonna restate the question
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, is that, so you've
already received the resume or your hiring
[SPEAKER_02]: manager, in your case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as an applicant, I am now,
you know, getting ready to come to you for
[SPEAKER_02]: our interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I do to make your job easier?
[SPEAKER_07]: Think for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, in essence, that is really it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you really want to establish,
obviously you're coming in for a specific
[SPEAKER_07]: position.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and it's been great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the concept for me is if everybody
wants to help, if I'm meeting with
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody, and I'll just digress for five
seconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're good at everything, that's
great.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that doesn't help me figure out where
to put you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for me, if you're coming in for a
specific position, learn about that
[SPEAKER_07]: position.
[SPEAKER_07]: Understand what that position does in
competitive industries, in competitive
[SPEAKER_07]: businesses, and even in my business.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the best thing for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, it saves me the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I really am going through trying to
fill this position, I am looking for
[SPEAKER_07]: shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking for somebody who's done their
homework, somebody who understands what
[SPEAKER_07]: that position requires, where they have
shortcomings that may not feed into the
[SPEAKER_07]: position, they're ready with those
rebuttals.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing more inspiring than
interviewing somebody who's prepared.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if they're not the most qualified
person for the position, I will lean much
[SPEAKER_07]: further towards somebody who's prepared
for the interview than somebody who
[SPEAKER_07]: thought they were just going to come in
and walk through it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, to me, to a certain extent,
that's disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm giving you this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm giving you my time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You obviously have a job.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to give somebody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody needs a job.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bumped into that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is the best thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell somebody, anticipate what I'm
going to ask, anticipate what I need,
[SPEAKER_07]: and honestly, to a certain extent,
the best interviews I've ever had,
[SPEAKER_07]: the shortest ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tyler, you've applied at dozens of
jobs, and you get them all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just can't keep you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So share with us some of your best
practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you learned?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the most important thing,
I think, and one of the biggest things is
[SPEAKER_06]: the cannabis industry is lacking right now
is professionalism.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of our stigma is we're
stupid, lazy stoners, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just not true.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just absolutely not true.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are a multitude of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you talk about these farmers
every day, every time it's six o'clock,
[SPEAKER_06]: five o'clock in the morning, you get out
there and tend their crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, if you can show these
employers that you're on time,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're dressed like a professional,
even if you're going as a blood tender or
[SPEAKER_06]: a trimmer, show up in a sports coat and a
jacket.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to have a three-piece suit
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have to be Louis Vuitton.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have to be like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you present yourself in a
presentable manner and then show that
[SPEAKER_06]: person, because what happens first thing
that people do is they recognize you,
[SPEAKER_06]: is they recognize how you put yourself
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what the employer is going to do
is recognize if you can't even put your
[SPEAKER_06]: shirt in your pants and be here on time,
you're definitely not going to be on time
[SPEAKER_06]: every single day and you're definitely not
going to do what I tell you to do when you
[SPEAKER_06]: get there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the professionalism aspect is number
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to win people over big time
just by showing up looking like you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: even need to be in that position,
like you should be in management or
[SPEAKER_06]: something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's showing them that there is
the potential to possibly move you to
[SPEAKER_06]: management in maybe 60, 90 days and then
fill those positions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bud trimmers, blood tenders, trimmers,
these are very high turnover positions.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to go through people left
and right.
[SPEAKER_06]: People will be there hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen people come in and hours they
were on the clock and then got fired.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's other people who really
love blood tending and they're going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: there for years.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have that blood tenderer
for five years because they work great
[SPEAKER_06]: with the customers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They really love their job and all this
other stuff and they're just in great
[SPEAKER_06]: position.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we see people like, for
instance, if you're not 25 years old and
[SPEAKER_06]: you're worried about not getting a blood
tender job, guess who has the most
[SPEAKER_06]: expendable money in the industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Older people.
[SPEAKER_06]: People who have full time jobs and make
six figures.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe if you're retired or you're
looking to get back into the industry or
[SPEAKER_06]: you're in your 40s or 50s and you're just
nervous about getting into the industry
[SPEAKER_06]: and where you'll fit because you don't
know anything, start out as a blood
[SPEAKER_06]: tender.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the people who come in are older
folks looking for topicals and edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just not the bros smoking weed or
hitting lunch every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a large demographic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's white people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's black people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Asians.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody smokes weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: All age groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to be able to put that on your
resume.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't matter who you are,
but as long as you come in being
[SPEAKER_06]: professional, then you're going to make a
huge difference in your ability to move up
[SPEAKER_06]: through that company faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, to Tyler's point, the
professionalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest myth that I think about this
industry is it happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sitting around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're listening to reggae music.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working super slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I work in a factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 8.30 to 5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday through Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a half hour lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get two 15 minute breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you show up to my interview in a pair
of jeans and a t-shirt and a sideways hat,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably going to ask you to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want you to dress professionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you come to work, you're going to
wear t-shirts and jeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we work with cannabis, we're not
wearing suits or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not for the interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need you to come in and I need you to be
prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask you, why do you want to
work in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you say because I like to smoke
weed, that's not the answer I'm looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people like to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't do anything for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear the passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear how you're passionate about
the plant, about its medicinal properties,
[SPEAKER_01]: about all the other things that you can do
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you want to be a part of a,
you know, we forget, but 47 states,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, we are, we are pioneers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are, we are, we are making the rules as
we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are, you know, part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people all over this country who
would kill to have these jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I have an employee who maybe
isn't showing passion or isn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, acting like they want to be
there, I'm like, dude, I got a stack of
[SPEAKER_01]: resumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have 20 people in here in five
minutes, all interviewing in suits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to tell me why you want to be
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not trying to sound mean or angry
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that this is a very desirable
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people want this job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to show me that you want to do
more than just show up and trim some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you do maybe want to become a
manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you do maybe want to do something
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the things that we look for
when we're hiring people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the things, you know,
when I ask you questions about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what are you passionate about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what, you know, what did you do well at
other jobs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to answer them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me, you know, tell me the things that
you don't do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me the things that you do do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just basically have answers to the
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a little research.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of us have websites and
Facebook pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can totally go online, see the
products that we make.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go in the store, see what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have videos on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go watch them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me that you did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be super stoked if that's
what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You come and tell me because that means
you really want to work here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes me want to hire you even
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, we are trying to take that
stigma away from a bunch of people getting
[SPEAKER_01]: stoned all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a business like any other
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be the Microsoft of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we want to do all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, be professional and be
prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so,
[SPEAKER_06]: yes, we are trying to take that stigma
away from a bunch of people getting stoned
[SPEAKER_06]: all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are trying to take that stigma away
from a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as Shango mentioned this earlier,
what you learn and where you're able to
[SPEAKER_06]: do, get a position here in Washington
State, you can take worldwide.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the leaders of the world industry
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's very important to set that
professionalism standard because when you
[SPEAKER_06]: go to Maryland or Alabama or Canada or
wherever, Japan, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're bringing the standards of the
industry that you are creating.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's definitely really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with Jed and go this way
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and this will be the last of the
preset questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we'll take your questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, kind of think if you've got one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Jed, so, you know, when we get in the
interview process, you know, they ask us
[SPEAKER_02]: all these questions and we feel a little
bit interrogated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to do our best.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, like, you know, at some point
during the interview, they say,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what are, you know, what's at least
one good question for applicants to ask
[SPEAKER_02]: back that shows that they're thinking
about what's going on in the room?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the best one is why are you in
this, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what the heck are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Square guy, square lady or super hippie?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting a business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you started a business before?
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you owned a business before?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what's your... My basket nicer
than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, this is the bowl in the china shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who are you to hire me?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, she goes right.
And you're, you know, totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably why I didn't get a call back from
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a really important question
because I think we both have to do each
[SPEAKER_05]: other's homework, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's, right, there's a lot of
desire to get into the sector.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to be the devil's advocate
because I am a labor advocate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that is probably the worst
side of what's happening right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking to an individual and I was
gathering some information about what he
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted out of a greenhouse manager role.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, yeah, I wanted this
person to, you know, go out and do
[SPEAKER_05]: outreach and get volunteer labor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, volunteer labor?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you mean about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, everybody wants to come work at a
cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we could just get a couple of
people a couple hours a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, so you mean like an
internship?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, yeah, kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So back to, is this your first business?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, have you done this before?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your success with volunteer labor?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so maybe in a nicer way, but these are
red flags.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I'm getting at,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that, you know, just because
we want to have a job doesn't mean we
[SPEAKER_05]: should take that first job or,
you know, we should just take the good
[SPEAKER_05]: word for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look into their Facebook, their social
media.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look into weed maps if it's a retailer
friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have reviews on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you'll find out really quickly
what the ethos was.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the core of that business is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go in there, be a secret shopper.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like check out what,
are the people happy when they're working
[SPEAKER_05]: in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they smiling?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like these are big things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Brett said, you're going to be
spending more time in this environment,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, likely than at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so make sure that's an environment you
want to be in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to Jeremy, so Jeremy, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're in an interview with somebody
and it comes from their moment to ask you
[SPEAKER_02]: a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what can they ask you where
you're like, yeah, man, they got it going
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think just in simplest terms,
I'm going to get like, so macro sense,
[SPEAKER_07]: two styles of answers or two styles of
questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a question that directly relates
to the conversation that you have.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, obviously if you're in a dialogue
or interview with somebody, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: if it's building off of that, that's
great.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I really look for is an in depth
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Years ago, I was doing some consulting for
a large scale company and I think probably
[SPEAKER_07]: the best question I've ever got was that
there was a merger going on that very few
[SPEAKER_07]: people really knew about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this person had actually figured out
what was going on with the merger and they
[SPEAKER_07]: asked a direct question about the division
of one specific department to another that
[SPEAKER_07]: they were actually applying for.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was blown away that that to this
day, I mean, this interview was going on
[SPEAKER_07]: 15 years ago, staggers me.
[SPEAKER_07]: This person was that developed and that
interested in the company.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, more importantly, they weren't
asking just to pry.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were asked because they were
genuinely interested in how it affected
[SPEAKER_07]: their position.
[SPEAKER_07]: More importantly, that this company was
splitting in details.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that really for me was what,
once again, as I've said a couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: times, that shows the interest in the
company.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do my work.
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, show that you've actually
researched the position.
[SPEAKER_07]: You understand more about what the
company, social media everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to not know about a company that you're
interviewing, which to this day staggers
[SPEAKER_07]: me, I'm blown away that people still come
into interviews and they're like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea about what your company or
what you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get into that spot, which is why I
prefer these kinds of settings.
[SPEAKER_07]: I much prefer it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not hiring for another three to four
months, but we're here today because I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: better at this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've met more people today than I feel I
will meet in the 5,000 resumes that I've
[SPEAKER_07]: probably got sitting in my inbox right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're getting resumes from all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_07]: People all want to come here, but that's
the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Send me a resume from Japan.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_07]: You call me and you call me three times.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then when you come to visit your
parents or whoever it is, when you're
[SPEAKER_07]: coming from Japan, you show up,
I'll probably just give you a job based
[SPEAKER_07]: off the principal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say you definitely have to know
your role in the position that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: applying for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're asking your question,
so ask a question that relates to the
[SPEAKER_06]: role.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to be a budtender,
ask about what kind of flexibility you
[SPEAKER_06]: have as a budtender or what kind of things
that you need to pick up.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to be working in higher up
management, start focusing on things that
[SPEAKER_06]: are really important like budgeting and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I worked at a grow in central Washington
last year where I did not ask those
[SPEAKER_06]: questions ahead of time and vet them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ended up walking through later and
finding out that there's holes in the
[SPEAKER_06]: walls and there's all this stuff that
needs to be upgraded and done and they
[SPEAKER_06]: don't have the budget to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I have to make magic happen and
they're expecting this to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, well, this is why we
hired you because you're the guy who makes
[SPEAKER_06]: magic happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, yeah, but there's like a hat
that I can pull things out of usually.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, yeah, I have no hat,
no walk here and no stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So know your role.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really important to really vet the
person you're interviewing with because
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That person is peeing you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you want to show up and you're
going to be helping that person build
[SPEAKER_06]: their business and make money.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once you can make that connection and
say, hey, I'm here to help you and show
[SPEAKER_06]: you what to do and help your business in
this aspect, they're going to really give
[SPEAKER_06]: you more responsibility and you're going
to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, once you figure that out, you can ask
the right questions for the employer and
[SPEAKER_06]: the position you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just to, you know, basically what
everyone's been saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: ask why are you passionate about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it about, you know, cannabis for
you that makes you want to sit here and
[SPEAKER_01]: interview me?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ask, you know, do you guys hire
a lot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a regular occurrence or,
you know, do you guys, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: does everyone here work for a long time?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long have you been with the company?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to give an answer like
two and a half years, three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people, we've worked here for a long
time because, you know, I do hear horror
[SPEAKER_01]: stories in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: About places that don't treat their
employees very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we try to do at Dom
Cannabis, we want it to be a destination
[SPEAKER_01]: workplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all these tasks happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, why do it at Dom?
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes Dom a special?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it's the way we treat our
employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the things, the fun things that we
come up to do with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had like a scavenger hunt last
Friday for employees, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like an employee rewards program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do pizza parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we try to do fun stuff because
we want to keep everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to pay a more competitive wage to
get a higher quality employee.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we pay that higher wage,
you know, that's expected to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good, you know, show up on time,
do a great job, do work, but you will be
[SPEAKER_01]: rewarded for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want you to have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys do anything fun for employees?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys, you know, have a cool lunch
room or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to pick a cocktail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it is, feel free to ask those
questions because those are the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that separate, you know,
you're going to trim in any place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, why trim at Dom?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you're going to trim at Dom
because you're going to love being there,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're going to love all the
people that work there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to ask those questions
because, you know, you're going to find
[SPEAKER_01]: out that you're going to get a lot more
positive from it and that we're willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about it because we love talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love talking about this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love talking about why we love doing
what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, getting us engaged and
getting us talking to you is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: very beneficial because, well,
that's going to translate down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor we're working in and we're having
conversations and talking about stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I thought about this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those kind of things,
you know, you're having conversations with
[SPEAKER_01]: coworkers and you could come up with an
idea that could actually now become a
[SPEAKER_01]: product or become something that we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, those are the kind of things that
we want people that are creative and are
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to ask questions and bend on their
feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, do you be conscious of where the
industry is right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go into a job and you're like,
well, you know, what's your 401K and
[SPEAKER_06]: what's your health benefits look like?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, dude, some of these places
can't even order like paper on the
[SPEAKER_06]: regular, like toilet paper and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't handle that stuff and that's
why they need it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, dude, the understanding of the
industry is in its infancy like Shango
[SPEAKER_06]: mentioned earlier, you know, and we are a
select few of states out of the country so
[SPEAKER_06]: it is important to not be like,
well, you know, I'm going to get a 401K
[SPEAKER_06]: and all this stuff and you're not going to
get that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not available.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, similarly, you know,
Brett nailed it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Brett's one of the few companies
that I've heard of that not only can pay a
[SPEAKER_02]: premium wage because they want to hold you
because, you know, it costs them money to
[SPEAKER_02]: retrain the new guy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they've also got the perks like,
you know, the scavenger hunt, the pizza
[SPEAKER_02]: party, the ping pong tables.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of the companies are giving you
that so they can pay you a really low
[SPEAKER_02]: wage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that you're, you know, willing to give
a little bit of sweat equity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually makes me want to go work at
Donald.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, that's what they try
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Donald Boyle is building that into their
brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he said, they only want to be a
destination employer where people want to
[SPEAKER_02]: work there so they can hire the best
people and once they're there,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't have to do the hiring thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like we talked about, like
companies don't want to be hiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a waste of their time because they
want to hire one good person and then have
[SPEAKER_02]: them stay with the company.
[SPEAKER_07]: For 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got about 10 more minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take probably two,
maybe three questions from all y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I would like you to do,
if you can, is number one, definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: speak up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then second, if you know one of the
fellows here who you think has got the
[SPEAKER_02]: answer you're looking for, direct the
question to them because we're not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have all four answer each of the
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't read your name tag,
but your hand is up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go right ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gabriel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gabriel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask all you guys, but whoever,
I guess, gentleman right here,
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe who it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy, that's Tyler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was your starting point in the
industry and when was like the turning
[SPEAKER_04]: point in where it became, I guess,
where you felt like you achieved success
[SPEAKER_04]: and you felt like it was a good,
notable turning point?
[SPEAKER_07]: I started in cannabis in the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_07]: I broke my neck snowboarding in the early
2000s.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really what started our R&D
firm, which was the CPC in Seattle,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is one of the earlier dispensaries
that came about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's funny, like success really,
when you think about legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't even know, I'd say that
maybe even only a few people in the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry have actually reached success.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's a couple of people that I
know on the retail side that are making
[SPEAKER_07]: killer bucks, but with 280E, which is a
federal tax code that you guys may or may
[SPEAKER_07]: not know about for us as retailers,
I can't take my payroll, my rent,
[SPEAKER_07]: my insurance.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't take any of that as a write-off,
so I'm paying taxes on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it makes running one of these retail
businesses, even if you're making $3 or $4
[SPEAKER_07]: million a year, your profit margins are
just minimal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's really funny to look at for me
going, I'm about to open two stores in
[SPEAKER_07]: three or four months.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I look at my competitors, even my
friends who own these stores and they're
[SPEAKER_07]: making $3, $4 million a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, do you feel successful?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got employees.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're even trying to build these
programs.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're even trying to build retirement.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're trying to build these incentives.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's really, I love this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you look at, I mean, these are my
friends and we're competing for the same
[SPEAKER_07]: group of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's only a certain number of
cannabis companies, only a certain number
[SPEAKER_07]: of cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be the most successful,
you're trying to build this immaculate
[SPEAKER_07]: team that you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going up against all your friends
to get these people and put them together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd say, you know, success at this
point is the fact that we're legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I started lobbying and I founded
a trade organization back in 2010 with a
[SPEAKER_07]: group of close people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's grown to be the Cannabis
Alliance with a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_07]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, we fought for legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would consider the fact that I have
the ability to sell cannabis legally.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a success.
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact that I can pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can put people, like my son,
my, you know, anybody else who's working
[SPEAKER_07]: for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those kids can go through college.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can have jobs and create a solid
industry and infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, me personally, I really do want to
change the world with Cannabis in Hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do think that these are,
that there's very few new industries left
[SPEAKER_07]: when you think about humans and the
aggregates that we create and the things
[SPEAKER_07]: that we make products with globally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis in Hemp are really the last
resource, the last real agricultural
[SPEAKER_07]: resource that we as humans have a tap on a
massive scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's really, for me, I think is a
huge success that we all live in a state
[SPEAKER_07]: where we can actually be in this room,
have this, I mean, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: hiring people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Paying taxes, selling cannabis,
which is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so to repeat Dave's awesome
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's all like, well, what if you had
really important experience that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis based?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does one of you guys feel like you want to
jump on it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, basically the cannabis industry is
like every other industry out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like commodity industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a commodity.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, unfortunately the Department of
Ag has not recognized it yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to clarify that they do
recognize that it's more in tax law.
[SPEAKER_05]: WSDA is all on board as cannabis is an
agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've been corrupted.
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just love the WSDA.
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch out for the bulldog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put your chin away.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I forgot what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Non-cannabis experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, super experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I worked at Havahart, they were
actually important.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were legitimately hiring people
specifically from outside of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry for the main sole reason of
having standardized procedures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Knowing, understanding how to really talk
to customers because it's not just
[SPEAKER_06]: probably one $20 bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the first questions they asked me
when I was hired at Havahart was what is
[SPEAKER_06]: the lineage of Blue Dream?
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue Dream is one of the most famous
strains in America.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the number one sole strain in
Washington state.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't come up with the lineage of
the number one sole strain in Washington
[SPEAKER_06]: state, the odds are you're probably not
going to get hired as a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you can go into some in-depth
knowledge and talk about, well,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a little bit of a background on
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody really knows the OG Kush story
unless you talk to the guys from Florida
[SPEAKER_06]: and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they're going to be like,
all right, this guy either knows what he's
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about or he's way too in-deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about the opposite side.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about industry specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's talking about starting a company in
video and going global with it and how is
[SPEAKER_02]: that applicable to cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is the perfect kind of guy
that you want to hire for management for a
[SPEAKER_02]: startup so that you can spring into other
states.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would recommend looking into the
upcoming distributor license that's coming
[SPEAKER_05]: out of LCB.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, realistically, that should be your
first thing on any resume.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at tier three producer processors
that are up in sales that need that word.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can really quickly review their total
sales on the LCB dashboard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look for somebody who's doing 1.6 and
above.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need people like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to reiterate something that Brett
said earlier, kind of cross-applied to
[SPEAKER_02]: this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's all like, if you come in,
tell me about your skills that you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: in another industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you manage people?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you sell at Nordstrom?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you read a customer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how to keep QuickBooks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you do basic math?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the things that you will do at
any job that can be very easily
[SPEAKER_02]: cross-applied to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowing Blue Dream is, you're right,
very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have specific experience if
you're going to want to be a budtender.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not all the jobs are budtenders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that the companies are starting to
become more and more in the black,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got to fill out middle management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not all the middle managers are going
to be cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be somebody who knows how
to freaking fix their HVAC, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the cannabis becomes secondary.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I think we have time for one
more question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't read your name tag, so just go
right at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to ask more so for,
like you said, you're doing Monday through
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday, 8.30 at 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're picking your building,
you're picking your location, how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: decide how to handle the community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as much people as we know that do
love marijuana, there are still the
[SPEAKER_00]: naysayers and just all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're trying to start a
business or trying to, how do you approach
[SPEAKER_00]: a community, especially you're working and
things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I work over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, how do you handle the
other businesses around, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are all good on the same page?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that a lot of the selection,
like our business is in South Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an industrial area.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of residential places
around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smell is definitely the factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you work at it long enough,
you don't notice it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I probably smell like marijuana
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't smoked anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done anything, but I probably
smell like it to somebody who doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke or isn't familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I leave work and I get on the bus,
everyone looks at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have air filters, air scrubbers that
we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think you can get complaints for
the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you probably want to pick a
location that's in a more industrialized
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could turn any building into a
grow operation, you know, fans and lights
[SPEAKER_01]: and all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I would definitely be looking
for a spot that is away from residential
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is away from neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to think about security.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had people jump over our fence and
try to steal our garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just twigs and leaves, and it won't
do anything, but people do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do it more than once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, security is definitely a
thing because, you know, this stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: still, you can go to Idaho and make a ton
of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just drive over there with it if
you can get a hold of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have very strict security.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have razor wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, you know, badges and everything
is, you know, very, very strict and safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's also required by the LCB.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cameras, all of those things are
required.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I would definitely look for more
industrial areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably, I don't think you can even
open one near like a school or near
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that has anything to do with the
daycare or any kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: social, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the kind of places that we
look to put businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, go on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, and especially based off of that
too, network.
That was the biggest thing for us.
And I'm on the retail side, so it really
was.
You go meet your neighbors.
You go to the Better Business Bureau
meetings.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's any sort of community meeting
in your general area, go to that meeting.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter who's there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to PTA meetings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put yourself out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the best thing for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We started at 09.
[SPEAKER_07]: There weren't, there really weren't that
many.
[SPEAKER_07]: There weren't any dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, really for us to be able to
open it, get a business license.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took me almost a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to all these meetings, city council
meetings, stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've been open since then.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, obviously besides people jumping
in your tracks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really quick, just a comment too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Works awesome in Western Washington in,
you know, more liberal land.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go over to Eastern Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yakima, we're dealing with the repeal of
the ban there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're implementing the businesses right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully getting some different zoning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then if you kind of take that perspective
over to Okanagan where they have
[SPEAKER_05]: pre-existing businesses over 30.
[SPEAKER_05]: What they did to try to push their ban is
they used the public concern of littering,
[SPEAKER_05]: loitering, and damage to the environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they used employees and case examples
of employees like peeling out of the dirt
[SPEAKER_05]: road real fast or throwing the garbage
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would like actually take pictures
and document this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think what my point here is,
is that every time you are outside,
[SPEAKER_05]: inside and outside of that environment,
you are a steward of this brand new
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to really bear that
responsibility like it is the coolest
[SPEAKER_05]: t-shirt you've ever owned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it is, it's a reality statement.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people have never even seen a
plant before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Period.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's just like an eye-opening point
to like, you know, if they've never seen a
[SPEAKER_05]: plant before, they've never seen something
that worked in the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a responsibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you are in a very lot of luck
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you take a look to your right,
you can see Ian over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has been going through probably an
array of more than anybody in the industry
[SPEAKER_06]: about community.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think he's been doing a really good
job at handling the community and all the
[SPEAKER_06]: negative press and stuff to really bring a
positive image to the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really hard in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's really difficult for you to
get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not bad for sales though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad for sales though.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is now beginning to build a better
community and there is a lot of acceptance
[SPEAKER_06]: in the Capitol Hill area for Ian's
business.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you do have any questions,
you have probably one of the best folks in
[SPEAKER_06]: the industry to ask right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely would be something to look
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before you walk out of the room,
we've got a couple of things to say to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I want to thank our panelists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tyler Marquardt, Brett Frazier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really pleased with the quality of the
information that came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you came in halfway through or you want
to show your friends or loved ones this
[SPEAKER_02]: panel, it will be available online on
video both at the Viridian Staffing
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook page and also my Facebook page at
Shango Lowes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you missed the keynote at one o'clock
on leveraging your passion to get a job in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and where I gave guerrilla
strategies for doing better than everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: else, you'll be able to see that video the
same places at Viridian Staffing and
[SPEAKER_02]: Shango Lowes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also the podcast host of Shaving Fire
where I talk to experts like this every
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to start subscribing to my
show, there are flyers in the back to
[SPEAKER_02]: remind you of ShavingFire.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are interested in having a head
shot because you want to put a nice photo
[SPEAKER_02]: on your upcoming resume, we've got a
photographer across the hall that are
[SPEAKER_02]: doing photo shoots for five minutes for
like 25 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a nice, easy way to get a
photograph.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no more photography.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're on your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta take a selfie and put that on
your resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in this room, in like four
minutes, Kara Bradford, one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: founders of Viridian Staffing,
will be giving the inside scoop from an HR
[SPEAKER_02]: professional about how to get a job in the
industry from her different perspective
[SPEAKER_02]: than you got from me at one o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, thank you so much for
joining us and thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
