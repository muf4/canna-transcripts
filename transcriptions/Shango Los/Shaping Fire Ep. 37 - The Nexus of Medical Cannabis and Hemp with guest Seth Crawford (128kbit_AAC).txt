[SPEAKER_00]: Up until last summer, I really didn't have
much good to say about CBD extracted from
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of CBD isolate or spiking
cannabis products with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD just doesn't work reliably for
patients on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of the plants' cannabinoids,
terpenoids, flavonoids, and lipids are
[SPEAKER_00]: vital components that humans require to
achieve the healing that comes with the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last summer, something new occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first season that plants were
grown at a commercial scale that were
[SPEAKER_00]: legally hemp, but they had all the medical
marijuana genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a monumental difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up until last summer, good folks were
taking industrial hemp fiber plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: extracting CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with CBD isolate, though,
is that the science does not support its
[SPEAKER_00]: medical efficacy, and the only reason it
exists is because of the artificial market
[SPEAKER_00]: for isolated CBD created due to federal
prohibition of the medicinal whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality whole plant medicine comes from
whole medical cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: not from hemp fiber plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the two may share a Latin name,
they are wildly different plants due to
[SPEAKER_00]: years of hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hemp plants just don't have the
terpene profiles and other attributes
[SPEAKER_00]: found in medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBD from hemp fiber plants is
federally legal enough that it can be sold
[SPEAKER_00]: online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people grow the fiber hemp plants,
extract the CBD, and are selling it
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last summer, though, some farmers in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: approached CBD plant genetics from the
opposite direction, and instead of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber plants, they turned off the allele
that makes THC in medical cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and grew truly medical cannabis plants
legally as hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants that normally would have been
highly regulated and sold in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: stores were allowed to be grown in open
fields unsecured because with the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: allele turned off, they tested below zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: While confusing for outsiders,
this evolution will again remake the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: market over the next five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for diehard CBD enthusiasts like me,
there's finally a scalable, low-cost
[SPEAKER_00]: method of providing CBD to patients
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next major milestone will be the
inclusion of cultivars that have above .3%
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, but we're not quite yet there
federally.

[SPEAKER_00]: Seth is a deinstitutionalized academic
with a master's in public policy and a PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: in sociology.
[SPEAKER_00]: His focus has been on the political

[SPEAKER_00]: For years now, he has been consulted by
lawmakers and policy specialists for
[SPEAKER_00]: better understanding of how the cannabis
economy works.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now co-founder of Oregon CBD,
a company researching, developing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and wholesaling high CBD cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're gonna talk about the dramatic
evolution occurring in CBD drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Seth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and your brother, Eric, saw this
opportunity to produce CBD on the large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale because there were so many patients
that were yearning for it, and yet to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it large scale, you had to figure out a
way to make it legal to grow in volume
[SPEAKER_00]: where you lived in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you and Eric see in this
opportunity that decided to push you in
[SPEAKER_00]: this direction of producing CBD from
plants that are legally hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have always really been looking forward
to the day of being able to grow enough
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to do scientifically accurate
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were hobby breeders for a decade before
we got into this full scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really neat things that you
can do as a hobby breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are doing this all over the
world, and we love to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a lot of things that you
just can't do with four plants or six
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that really emerges when you start
growing thousands at a time to do your
[SPEAKER_01]: selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the driving factors for us
was just being able to breed better
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you can do a SIFT that's that huge,
you're just gonna jump ahead of hobbyists
[SPEAKER_00]: like you were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only gonna do their patient max of
four or 15 or whatever it's gonna be.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I want to really drill
on in this part, that's what sets you
[SPEAKER_00]: apart from a lot of the other hemp from
CBD producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because actually, I do talk a lot of trash
about hemp derived CBD on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the weird thing is I always have to
make this caveat, except for the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes from Oregon CBD seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you guys are going about this a
different way than nearly everybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I understand it all correctly,
so many of the hemp from CBD companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: they started with the fibrous version of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are trying to breed in the
medicinal qualities of full cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: content, medicinal terpenes, in order to
be able to pull the entourage effect out
[SPEAKER_00]: of a fiber plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have not seen a lot of success in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you guys came from the other
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys actually started with a legit,
healing, full spectrum medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you decided to turn off the THC
allele, which as far as I'm understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: from outside of the CBD hemp market,
that is a wholly new approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So break that out a little bit for us,
would you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's an accurate description of
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only entourage effect for individuals
who would be consuming the final product,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the other thing that you end up
missing out from just a basic plant
[SPEAKER_01]: biology perspective, if you have no
terpenes in your plant, you generally have
[SPEAKER_01]: more pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have more disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have more problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis in the long term evolved many,
many different terpene combinations that
[SPEAKER_01]: allow it to thrive in its natural
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the hand of humans has started to
select for those different
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics, we've obviously
gravitated towards particular smells and
[SPEAKER_01]: particular effects that go along with
those terpenes, whether it's for THC in
[SPEAKER_01]: combination with THC or CBD, or as we'll
talk about pretty soon, CBG and other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we were really, really trying to
do was to just recreate that, like you
[SPEAKER_01]: said, an entourage effect, but that
beautiful palette that comes along with
[SPEAKER_01]: well-bred cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oregon, we're lucky enough to be
surrounded by literally decades of
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible breeding that has been done by
a number of different individuals and put
[SPEAKER_01]: into the public well in terms of cannabis
varieties that individuals have access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we had figured out how to essentially
turn off the THC production, it allowed us
[SPEAKER_01]: to then go back to those wells and find
those really interesting terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: combinations and breed them back in to
create new lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was basically the essence of our
business to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can you tell us?
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that there's a certain part
of where your genetics come from that is
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary, but I'm sure that there are
people who are listening like me who would
[SPEAKER_00]: just love to hear what cultivar of medical
cannabis you started with and what you did
[SPEAKER_00]: to it to turn off this THC allele,
because I'm sure that that has raised
[SPEAKER_00]: flags for a lot of GMO-minded people in
the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of us who really care,
can you break that out a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's really no secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't start with anything that was
miraculous or strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started just like most other,
I would say, small-scale breeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting different varieties from Europe,
mostly from Spain, and also natively
[SPEAKER_01]: sourced here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the varieties, you can see sort of
the history of the emergence of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the varieties were one-to-ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are type two cannabis plants that
have relatively equal parts THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the starting block that we began
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really what it comes down to with all
real cannabis breeding, the answer to get
[SPEAKER_01]: to your solutions generally starts with
inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just do a lot of line breeding,
inbreeding specific plants, selfing those,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when you self those plants,
you start to lock in specific
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And say with a one-to-one plant,
if you were to self that, you're gonna end
[SPEAKER_01]: up with 25% of the resulting progeny as
high CBD plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25% of the resulting progeny will be high
THC, and the other 50% are, roughly 50%,
[SPEAKER_01]: are still type twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the initial process was not,
at the time, it may have seemed fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: revolutionary, but in reality,
it's really not, and there are a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: other people who are doing that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the later advances that we were
able to achieve, like the flowering type
[SPEAKER_01]: three high CBD plants, and now type four
CBG plants, that I think is, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely something that did set us
apart, and it was mostly driven by
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could create really good plants,
identify them, clone them, and run those
[SPEAKER_01]: clones in fields, and you have really good
outcomes, but to grow at a truly
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial scale to make an affordable
medicine for people that's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: effective, you really can't just grow
clones, and that's when we started really
[SPEAKER_01]: working on producing viable F1 hybrid
seeds using our very inbred line and
[SPEAKER_01]: recombining those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was the goal always to create a feminized
and auto flower seed, or is that something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you realized was gonna be necessary
as you started interacting with your
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural clients and realizing,
oh my God, we need to make this easier?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if for us it was out of
necessity, just in terms of how we could
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize our own production, Eric and I
have always seen auto flowering plants as
[SPEAKER_01]: having a very interesting niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: If managed properly, and we've always been
curious about whether or not that would
[SPEAKER_01]: end up leading to innovations in large
scale agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it does, and I think what
we're seeing right now is not just on the
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD side, but also for THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you can get the right terpene
combination in those flowers, auto flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: are fantastic for large scale production.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's going into an oil, whether that's
for consumption or for a vape pen or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever else, a myriad of products are on
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Autos are incredibly useful, but it was
mostly just trying to develop initially,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is back in 2016, it seems like
forever ago right now, but in 2016 we were
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to give ourselves as many options
as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to grow early in the
season, your best bet is probably an auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're trying to grow to maximize
production, you want to have a plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: finishes early in the season, but is still
photo period sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we developed our early lines to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a long enough growing
season, you can potentially have a third
[SPEAKER_01]: crop with auto flowers, since they tend to
be a little bit more robust and resistant
[SPEAKER_01]: to freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really interesting to
consider because feminized and auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in the traditional heritage cannabis
farmer world, they get a short shrift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized and auto flowers are somehow
seen as unnatural, and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of gripes with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you talk to people about their
particular gripes, it's because they got
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds that had been bred into a
feminized, and so now there's like hermies
[SPEAKER_00]: in their stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems that the reasons why people
don't like feminized and auto flower has
[SPEAKER_00]: little to do with the seed itself and
everything to do with how people have used
[SPEAKER_00]: them incorrectly for their purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you're designing these seeds
specifically for multi-acre grows in an
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural setting where you're dealing
with really high volume and every plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has to be the same and harvested either at
the same time or in known waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's an important thing to
point out is that these are feminized and
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower seeds for a reason that has
never existed before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're almost two separate issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the complaints about auto
flowering plants, especially for THC
[SPEAKER_01]: production, were legitimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew auto flowering THC plants in 2006,
2007, shortly after they kind of emerged
[SPEAKER_01]: on the market, and they were terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could see the promise with
them, but the terpene profile was awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It left you just feeling like you've been
hit by a train and not in a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not have good palates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the performance was something that I
just immediately latched onto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And said, God, if you can make the flavor
better and increase the overall resin
[SPEAKER_01]: content, this has potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a decade to get back to that need
before we started developing the newer
[SPEAKER_01]: versions of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that interim time, in that 10
years, there was sort of a revolution in
[SPEAKER_01]: good terpenes being added into those auto
flowering THC plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So breeders have been working to improve
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're to the point today where
you can end up with fairly high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that come out of the auto flowering
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the feminized seed, your point is
spot on.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of breeders, and you can't see me,
so I'm doing air quotes at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: but breeders who are more interested in
just selling seed than necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: creating good, stable lines, they're not
as careful with weeding out those
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphroditic traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're to the point with our breeding that
we see one male, and they're not males.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're definitely female plants,
but they have male phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've found one in 4,000 in our fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is literally, we're talking about
millions of plants that have been grown in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon and elsewhere over the last two
years using our seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very consistent rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get one in 4,000 that have a male
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've screened them using PCR,
doing the genomics test from medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics, and they're female, even though
they have male phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The really interesting background on that,
too, is that if you use one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypic males to pollinate other female
plants, you're gonna end up with 50% that
[SPEAKER_01]: are phenotypically male and 50% that are
phenotypically female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a strange mutation that's going
on, and I'm not really sure what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody knows at this point,
but an interesting feature for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one in 4,000 versus having
hermaphroditic traits built into your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, we feel like that's a pretty good
ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, that's one plant every two acres
that you end up having to cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's actually epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that phenotypically male yet somehow
female plant be a risk to the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can there be any pollination?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll definitely pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we recommend to farmers that you
basically walk your field.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old adage of the best fertilizers are
farmers' footprints is definitely true in
[SPEAKER_01]: this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go out and you find those as soon as
they start flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very easy to spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look just like a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though that adds labor for the
farmer, it kind of warms my heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even though we are scaling up and
industrializing several aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production, there's still
something in it that the farmer has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field and be around the plants to
give it that human touch, or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so, very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really draws attention to the risk
of pollen floating around in the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one male plant, it's not going to
pollinate your entire crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chances of it pollinating a
neighbor are very slim.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you will end up with a 25 to 30 foot
section of your field that is just
[SPEAKER_01]: completely seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seeds obviously scattered throughout
wherever the wind was blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a fairly interesting, I say
interesting, now because it's been long
[SPEAKER_01]: enough that I'm not completely emotionally
scarred from it anymore, interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: situation back in 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trying to make feminized seed
doing a light deprivation run in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a neighboring farmer that had
planted about 38 million male-female ham
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, just broadcast seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was his first year growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it ended up, it's a tremendous amount
of males that were out in this field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pollen from that field destroyed
farms 15 miles to the north, 15 miles to
[SPEAKER_01]: the south, 15 miles to the west,
excuse me, to the east.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody to the west was fine because
that's the way that the wind was blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that one just small scale experiment
ended up in the first major year of
[SPEAKER_01]: production for Oregon recreational
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seeded a lot of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It destroyed, we lost 15 million seeds in
that summer alone just due to
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to destroy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pollen is a significant issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that we have tried to
be out on the forefront in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: providing education to farmers to make
sure that they know just what the risks
[SPEAKER_01]: are and to have good communication with
their neighbors, but to also question the
[SPEAKER_01]: veracity of seed makers with the claims
that they're making.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the adage about cannabis seeds being
a seeded business is very, very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your unfortunate neighbor seeding the
whole valley, and you mentioned it points
[SPEAKER_00]: out the importance of communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did your valley do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because your valley is full of hemp
farmers now, from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you guys do to increase your
communication so that kind of malarkey
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't happen again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's been an uphill battle,
to be perfectly honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most farmers are responsible about it and
try to communicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Department of Agriculture in Oregon
makes available the list of farm sites and
[SPEAKER_01]: the acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know where all the other hemp farms
are in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have email addresses and phone
numbers and that sort of thing to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to communicate with other farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main thing that you have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, there are some
especially older traditional farmers who
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of thumbed their nose and just say,
look, I have a right to farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've basically had to come back and
say, well, we do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your right to farm is infringing on
ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you pollinate our crop with your
grain crop that's worth a dollar a pound,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're probably going to have to resort to
legal action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the precedent needs to be set that
people who pollinate others are
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to change hats for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go to our first commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to this point, we've been talking a
little bit about specifically Oregon CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people know you as your
academic professor role where you testify
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of the legislature and are just a
general CBD expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to put on that hat for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take off your CEO co-founder hat and
put on your professor hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And answer me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is what you are doing there and the
seeds that you are providing to your
[SPEAKER_00]: partners in Oregon, how does that compare
to what is going on in the other hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: hotspots in the country, for example,
Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I tell people about what you're
doing in Oregon, which when I toured your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, it's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you if you've been taking care of
patients for a long time and you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, you're like, oh, my God,
this is like the Holy Grail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, low price, high turps,
high CBD, not from fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but at the same time, there are people
also excited about their breakthroughs in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado and other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but they seem to be of a different
tenor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stepping away from the fact that you've
got a company and into your academic
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes, how is what you are doing comparing
to what's happening elsewhere in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's you know, if we're going to go to
the professor route, it kind of gets to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point of the work that I was doing
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: My area of expertise was sort of social
networks, long term organization of
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalist societies, you know,
these these sort of big picture,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, five hundred year or five
hundred year views on the development of
[SPEAKER_01]: different different social systems around
different technologies, whether that's an
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural technology or markets that,
you know, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bring that to where we're at today
with with cannabis, because it's it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely exceptional time to be alive in
witnessing what's going on with this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular market in good ways and in bad
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see the good, as you just described,
incredible access for for patients and
[SPEAKER_01]: people who didn't even call themselves and
would never call themselves patients or
[SPEAKER_01]: just people who are a little bit older who
have aches and pains and they can take
[SPEAKER_01]: this what amounts to a nutritional
supplement and end up having a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's it's de-stigmatized to the
point where we're just constantly being
[SPEAKER_01]: approached by people who are using these
compounds to to just have a have a better
[SPEAKER_01]: time in their their golden years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fantastic to see that the negatives
are, you know, consolidation and lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity and all of the things that you
see happen in oligopoly markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: monopolistic markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing that definitely emerge right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the exciting, the exciting side in
these different states, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky, North Carolina now is coming
online in a big way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's we have thirty seven
states that have industrial hemp laws
[SPEAKER_01]: passed, allowing some form of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, Oregon, Colorado and Kentucky
are definitely out in the forefront.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the folks who were early adopters who
had some capital behind them have finally
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten their their processing centers up
and running to a point where they they
[SPEAKER_01]: they can actually handle the amount of
material that is being produced and not
[SPEAKER_01]: only handle it, but the demand is more CBD
has has entered the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The demand has just increased
exponentially along with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those situations where the
more people know, the more they're exposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to it, the greater the demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's worked out really well for for
everybody in this in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome innovations both on the product
side, on the extraction side and the
[SPEAKER_01]: scalability, just being able to put good,
good marketing plans together on how to
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute this and get it from point A to
point B, having a more robust regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: environment where we it's no longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're to the point now with hemp
at the federal level that we we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not just going to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's only going to continue to
expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's given given a lot of the people
in the industry a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: confidence that the direction that we're
going is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's OK to continue to invest your
time and labor in this because it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really just going to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as seed providers go,
I want to drill down very specifically to
[SPEAKER_00]: this potentially difficult question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so what makes Oregon CBD seeds great is
the uniqueness of your seeds and the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that you came from the the medical
cannabis side and then brought it under
[SPEAKER_00]: the umbrella of hemp by creative
hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anybody else in the country been
successful doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do you have competitors that are
doing putting out these same kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that they have found their way to
the same solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you guys the only folks in the
country that are that that are coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis medicine side and not from
the fiber hemp direction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, there's there are definitely
definitely others who've been doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing and who've been doing it just
as long as us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some good some good breeders in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have good breeders in Oregon as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fun part is, is there's there's always
somebody always somebody doing something
[SPEAKER_01]: unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that really sets us apart was
the creation of the auto flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition to that are the
development of our early flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: photoperiod sensitive varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are the only ones who are doing that
at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, that's that's the major
technological innovation in addition to
[SPEAKER_01]: having terpene rich, very, very high
content plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the major the major innovation
that has really pushed a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers in Colorado and Kentucky in in
addition to Oregon farmers in our
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the three hotspots of Oregon,
Colorado and Kentucky, are you guys all
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to buy seeds from each other or do
you have to buy seeds in state?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we are allowed to ship anywhere in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a section 7606 farm bill compliant
industrial hemp research program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ship to Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ship to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ship Vermont, Maine, North Carolina,
South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some clients in Florida that are
coming online later this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywhere there's a hemp program,
we can ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so now with this first set,
I was talking about kind of where the the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed technology is at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think let's wrap up this for sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited about the second set
because your season was insane and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: it was very enjoyable for me to watch it
from a state of way and and and watch you
[SPEAKER_00]: go crazy and it'll be a good story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so stick around, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Seth Crawford of Oregon
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We humans are attracted to plants because
they offer us relief and are a whole lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, though, the best parts are
buried inside the plant and we need to use
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty extraction technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to cannabis, it is
extraordinarily important to extract its
[SPEAKER_00]: precious oils without changing them in the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to preserve the properties of the
cannabinoids, terpenes and other
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents that all work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1994, Eden Labs has been developing
extraction technology and processes to do
[SPEAKER_00]: just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden Labs was founded by a cannabis loving
engineer during the early days of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the expanded Eden team has been
designing and building industry leading
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions for cannabis extraction ever
since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden Labs flagship product is the newly
improved high flow CO2 extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: As other extraction companies enter the
market, it is the high flow from Eden Labs
[SPEAKER_00]: that everyone chases and tries to compare
themselves with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the improved automation
software allows data to be collected,
[SPEAKER_00]: stored and studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden Labs can outfit your whole lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden's cold finger ethanol extractor
creates astonishing whole plant extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: working alone or in tandem with an initial
stream distilling step to isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: monoterpenes before extracting the rest of
the botanical constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden offers you many options, including
vacuum distillation, column distilling,
[SPEAKER_00]: stirred reactor units and accelerated
solvent recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you partner with Eden Labs,
your lab team is enrolled into the Eden
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs training program to boost their
understanding of Eden's best practices to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that your outputs are exactly what
you require for your application,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be dab oil, oil for pen
cartridges or edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you work with Eden, you're not just
buying the tech, you are buying dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: customer support to help you attain your
business goals too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear Eden's CEO, AC Braddock,
talk about the company's values during
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire episode 19 that was all about
CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the new companies in the market
just smell opportunity, slap an extractor
[SPEAKER_00]: together and hire a marketing company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden Labs has been listening to feedback
from extractors and consumers for about 25
[SPEAKER_00]: years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about both you and your
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partner with Eden Labs to extract
astonishing cannabis oils and turbines
[SPEAKER_00]: that you'll be proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash Eden
to find out more.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los and our guest
this week is Seth Crawford.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's co-founder of Oregon CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've got you all set up at
how you got to this summer there,
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth, let's talk about this craziness that
was this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have an idea of the magnitude
we're talking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Describe the number of fields that you
were running and then also the associated
[SPEAKER_00]: fields like in your area that were using
your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had five separate locations,
various acreages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our main research and development field
was about 40,000 plants planted on around
[SPEAKER_01]: 35 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total number of seeds that went out for
the state of Oregon and to a couple other
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were looking at about 2000 acres worth
last season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Substantial number of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, substantial number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really enjoyable to walk through that
much terpenes being given off to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you had your fields and you
provided your seed leadership to other
[SPEAKER_00]: folks in your valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've already hit the story of the guy
pollinating the valley a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm kind of putting together is
that your local area, you guys have kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of become the epicenter of hemp growing in
Oregon and there's some amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are kind of like an industry
block of intention, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's an accurate
description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I'd also throw in southern Oregon
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern Oregon has long been a large
cannabis producing area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the recreational farmers
have, they started out last year doing
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller plots, but are moving in this year
to bigger plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really becoming a force unto its
own as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here in the valley, after the great
pollination event of 2016, everybody sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of banded together to try to ensure that
new farmers were educated and that the
[SPEAKER_01]: other farmers had access to not only
feminized seed, but good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the major concerns that we've had
is sort of unsavory characters making
[SPEAKER_01]: claims about seed that they sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last season, people were saying,
oh, this is mostly feminized and farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: would plant it and it would be 50% female,
which is not mostly feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happened on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had other seed sellers who were
offering varieties that were actually type
[SPEAKER_01]: two plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So equal part CBD to THC and it led to
about 10% of the state failing their THC
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody's trying to watch out not
only for their own interests, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: interests of the larger industrial hemp
community at large.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's turned into a nice sort of
cooperative that everybody can contribute
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just occurred to me that the compliance
tests to make sure that the amount of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plants are so low, those happen at
the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because your plants are high CBD,
no THC, your farms don't have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hardcore security around them that
THC plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny and somehow ironic that
there were all of these one-to-one plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that were being grown in fields just out
next to people's houses and they were fine
[SPEAKER_00]: and safe just because no one knew they had
THC in them, even though those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: like every high schooler's dream to go
grab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's scary to be perfectly honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad for the farmers that ended up
buying those seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were built by unscrupulous breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're saying is completely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that if you're over 1%,
so if you're over 0.3% THC, you fail your
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance test.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're over 1%, you get turned into
the local sheriffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a significant problem,
especially if you have 10 to 20 acres of
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The numbers that you're talking about
would lead to a life sentence in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Jeff Sessions was just talking
about reinstituting the death penalty for
[SPEAKER_01]: people who were growing that many cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a laughing matter to a certain
extent because we can say, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: people did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though it was unscrupulous,
people who were misleading them,
[SPEAKER_01]: the world didn't end just because some THC
was grown outside without offense and
[SPEAKER_01]: security.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the neat part.
[SPEAKER_01]: The downside is it's a legitimate risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of problems that can
come along with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the thing that you could pull a
felony for what is absolutely a
[SPEAKER_00]: technicality in seed purchase,
that is scary as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the part that really got us is that we
knew that this was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew where the seed source was coming
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that there had been male THC
plants that were outdoors in a neighboring
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we knew that the seed crop had been
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because there was no seed
certification program, you don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have any verification that the seed is
actually type 3 industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of a free-for-all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's allowed some grifters to enter
the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: They usually stick around for one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody figures out that they don't
know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll try to get some quality seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the meantime, lives are ruined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crops are lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a black eye for the entire
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this next part of the interview
that kept me so excited to have you back
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as that you could find time for us
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the evolution of your business
model over the course of this last summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'd like you to do is to... I
understand that the major force of your
[SPEAKER_00]: business model was that you were going to
make and sell feminized auto flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: high CBD, nearly zero THC seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as part of that, you need to have
these research and development fields so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can see how your plants are
coming along and how they work in real
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the season, you were
going to have, I think you said maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: seven acres or something like that of
plant material that was R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you've got all this flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to kind of set you up to
tell this story of what was your plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: what were your plans going to be for the
flower at the beginning of the season?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did that evolve over the course of
the summer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, this valley as we had
experienced the year before, sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: there's pollen floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had basically just planned on
planting our field, getting our research
[SPEAKER_01]: crops in, running the risk of getting
pollinated and having a seeded crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically the only option that you
have at that point is to turn it into oil
[SPEAKER_01]: and sell it to extractors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was essentially our plan going
into the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just wanted to do our field trials to
ensure that the varieties that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: offering to farmers for this season
actually performed the way that we
[SPEAKER_01]: described.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we like to run our field trials the
year before and then offer the seed once
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been progeny tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to the end of the season and we
kept checking the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's no pollen yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, another week goes by and there's
no there's no pollen yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not seeing any seeds forming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we finally got basically
about two weeks away from two weeks away
[SPEAKER_01]: from from the initial harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything looked really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there were no seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, at that point, you're
looking at you're looking at 35 acres of
[SPEAKER_01]: unseeded, just beautiful terpene rich
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as as you got to experience,
it's it's very hard to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately describe the excitement that
one who's passionate about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes will have walking through a
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so there's so much joy in that
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walking through and smelling all the
terpenes as the sun is hitting the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're all calling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yeah, it's otherworldly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just it puts a smile on my face to
think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time we we send a farmer out the
door with with seed, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the one thing that we generally leave
them with is just wait until August.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when your field is in full bloom
and it's you don't have to harvest just
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's a truly magical experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's transformational.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we got to that point in the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we we had had some some
folks come from Switzerland who really
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to get our flowers because,
you know, they came and they smelled them
[SPEAKER_01]: early in the season and went, wow,
these are these are tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we, you know, knowing that the risk of
contamination, I didn't want to put us
[SPEAKER_01]: into a situation where we, you know,
we would get into a contract to supply
[SPEAKER_01]: trimmed flowers or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then end up with a seeded crop and not
be able to follow through on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once we made it to that point in the
season, we realized that, OK, we're we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to trim and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: As as many of these acres as we possibly
can and send them internationally to to
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me hold you right there,
because that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, how did the people in
Switzerland found find out about your
[SPEAKER_00]: little farm in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm honestly not sure, but we're
contacted pretty regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Swiss European, sorry, the European
and Swiss hemp market for smokable flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: has has really just taken off in the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland has a one percent THC rule,
which gives you a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: flexibility in in the oil content of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they they've been producing it in
mostly in glass houses for the last two
[SPEAKER_01]: years, trying to meet the demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they saw Oregon as, you know,
sort of a hotbed of of production and
[SPEAKER_01]: started reaching out to different farms
throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the farms that were growing
good material were all actually growing
[SPEAKER_01]: our seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as they say, the roads all seem to lead
back to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they found us and and we got them
some flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so one of the things that I picture in
my head is that as the summer goes and as
[SPEAKER_00]: more people hear your story and they hear
the first podcast that I did with you at
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning of the season, and,
you know, and the hemp people just start
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about what you guys are doing,
that you're starting to get more and more,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, VIP contact from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and interested people from other
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I can feel like this brewing,
this attention and people making contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with you and yearning for your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how it was feeling for you as well
as you're like, oh, my God, we're we're
[SPEAKER_00]: riding this bull of a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now everybody wants it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was that was true both on our
flower material and on the seed itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the flower material was I think it
was excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The products that are coming out of it
were were definitely things that I'm proud
[SPEAKER_01]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everybody on our crew is would
say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because it was an R&D field,
you know, we were basically doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: trials for what other farmers will be
growing this season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the the buzz was definitely palpable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it led to not only the demand,
high demand for the flower material,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the resulting trim and all the other
products that go along with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for the seed as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our our harvest season was was long,
arduous as they always are for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it didn't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we went from we went from our our
flower harvest and trimming and exporting
[SPEAKER_01]: to building out new facilities in three
separate counties to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_01]: could we could meet the the exploding seed
seed demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I want to take a quick
second here and mention you've you've
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped out three or four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been increasing as the interview has
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're listening and you're like,
I keep on losing like a second or two,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's because where Seth lives way out,
rarely in Oregon, they are experiencing a
[SPEAKER_00]: thunderstorm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the weather gets bad,
they drop packets sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think that it's that it's your
phone or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just we're just occasionally
dropping packets from Seth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so thanks for staying on the line
there, Seth, even though it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather's getting crazy down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, sorry for the drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, you know, so so so I want to
finish up this great Switzerland story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so now that you know, the the Swiss
folks found you and they contacted you and
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted to buy your flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're like, I don't want to commit to
the flower because we think it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get seeded over the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're two weeks out from harvest and
you've got all of this unseeded Sensovia
[SPEAKER_00]: high CBD flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, my God, this product,
this the value of this product just just
[SPEAKER_00]: shot up because it's got great value in
other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did that deal finish up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, I talked to you briefly
during that time and you were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, my God, we've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to hire all this new staff and
trimming machines and and we got to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out how to package this and get it to
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so tell that part of the story,
because I found it pretty engaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was traumatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to revisit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, just a number of different
growing pains and logistical details of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, basically learning how to
operate large scale machine trimmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: hiring a very large crew of people to come
in to do the finished trimming with that
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never I'd never shipped quantities
that we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up using FDA approved 55 gallon
drums with plastic liners.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could fit about 30 pounds without
without crushing the resulting product,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 30 pounds in each one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could fit four of those on a
pallet and then shrink wrap them and off
[SPEAKER_01]: they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just a nonstop deluge of
trimming, packaging, wrapping,
[SPEAKER_01]: shipping and and in going back into the
field to then harvest more and more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, basically maximizing our
drying space and our throughput and just
[SPEAKER_01]: have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way that we could have done
what we did without the crew that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was very devoted to to the
cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a lot of people, it was sort of a
mind blowing experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody is used to you think
industrial hemp and you you definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think of the flowers that we were
pulling out of that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it was it was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely definitely a good
experience for everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the times that you're
really glad that you're growing auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, too, so that you can stagger the
harvest, because with with regular
[SPEAKER_00]: photosensitive flowers, everything would
have been ready just about the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is this is the interesting part.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have auto flowering plants,
but the material that we were trimming
[SPEAKER_01]: were their photo period sensitive
varieties, but they have been designed to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower very, very early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other characteristic that we've
been able to put into these plants is that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can stagger the harvest with them and
you get about a three week window.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first batch was finished the first
week of September.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second batch was done the second week
of September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, we were basically
harvesting until the rains hit after that
[SPEAKER_01]: with the later the later maturing
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they they're all within the same the
same basic harvest window.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's one of the innovations
that we've been able to that we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: successful in breeding into the lines that
we've developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all familiar with seeing the
kinds of machines that are used to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: fibrous hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of, you know, mechanizations can
you use for harvesting when you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve the flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this all done by hand and the only
mechanized part is the trimmer?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's what we tell clients is that
there are a number of different options
[SPEAKER_01]: for your finished product at the end of
the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can you can flash dry it and
the terpenes will vaporize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's basically only useful for
isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a market for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's although it's a lower value than the
next best option is something like a low
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature hop kiln that's operating
anywhere between 80 to 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just moving a tremendous amount of
air, just getting that air movement to
[SPEAKER_01]: dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those products retain a lot of the heavier
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose your monoterpenes, but you still
end up with a nice synergistic potential
[SPEAKER_01]: medical product that would be turned into
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The highest value is if you you treat it
just like a high grade THC plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you hang dry it, slowly cure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, we went with the the
mechanical route on on on trimming just
[SPEAKER_01]: because the cost of hand trimming would
have been prohibitive and not physically
[SPEAKER_01]: possible, to be perfectly honest with the
the quantity that we were dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also probably not necessary,
honestly, you know, hand trimming is
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly something that changes the bag
appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the at this point, the audience that
you were serving were cigarette smokers in
[SPEAKER_00]: in Switzerland, which is certainly a
different crew than West Coast cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been a big fan of machine trim,
but it did a decent job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I got to ask, how did how did you
get all these pallets?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and if you can tell me how many
pallets of these four drums were there and
[SPEAKER_00]: how how did you get them to Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I don't even remember how many
there were.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a blur.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there were a lot that left our
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like like over 100, though, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not not that many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that many.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no way to translate how 37 acres
into pallets, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different products as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the with the pallets, we would
basically just we had a shipping company
[SPEAKER_01]: that would arrive and take the pallets
directly to the Portland airport and they
[SPEAKER_01]: would they would fly out to Zurich with a
direct flight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the company that was purchasing it
from us would take possession at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland terminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was no longer ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in legal possession of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So off it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that's that's one way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have these very large bags are
used for grass, grass seed, other other
[SPEAKER_01]: seed crops, grains called superset.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those can hold about anywhere between
two hundred and fifty to three hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of trim material all at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're basically just a pallet's
worth of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the industry standard in
terms of of of shipping large quantities
[SPEAKER_01]: of material to processors domestically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that's also now going
international as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this last question before we go to
break, I hope that you don't deem it
[SPEAKER_00]: unfair, but I'm going to set it up
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it could be a hard question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you to be a very patient
centric dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both you and your brother have got big
hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You you work with patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give advice to people for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like them to have strong
endocannabinoid systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are very invested in your local
cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're you're the kind of people that
we want to see succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I visited the farm, I had all
these visions of of low priced cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the hands of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was excited for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet somehow I was also excited for you
that you got this amazing buyer in
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all this CBD was now leaving the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had to have been torn about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to hear about your decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very, very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the largest influencer of that
was the fact that, you know, we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: this Oregon market that we could have sold
directly into had it not been prohibited
[SPEAKER_01]: by state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, you could not sell
cannabinoids or flower product into the
[SPEAKER_01]: adult use market if it was derived from
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just the strange quirk in in
the Department of Justice in the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon in their interpretation of the
existing law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took us a whole year to get that
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just our our lobbying group for
industrial hemp farmers just got that
[SPEAKER_01]: passed in the last legislative session in
March.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hope to be able to to sell products,
not just CBD, but also CBG and other novel
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids as we as we're able to
isolate them into the Oregon market first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very bittersweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both sides of that to to to see all the
potential and then realize that it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going to make it into local
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bittersweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go ahead and take our
second short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Seth Crawford of
Oregon CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using pesticides when growing cannabis has
been common for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, though, we know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that most pesticides formulated
for food crops have never been tested for
[SPEAKER_00]: use with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested to be eaten in tiny
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not been tested to be inhaled
and especially not concentrated into a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical residues from pesticides are not
healthy for anyone, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: especially dangerous for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: For commercial cannabis growers,
this has become very impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis enthusiasts and patients have
gotten educated enough that they avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who used pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but states across the
country have begun making pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: testing mandatory on all licensed cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time has come to find a better way to
fight garden pests than covering your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let some good bugs fight your bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects and predatory mites
have come a long way since we were buying
[SPEAKER_00]: ladybugs online and putting them in the
grow room and just hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies Biocontrol can help you
solve pest issues without using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies founder Shane Young
learned best practices from working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry and has
fine-tuned those strategies specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: for large cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane works with commercial cannabis
clients across the country to ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they keep their crops safe and pest-free
without the use of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies has proven solutions for
spider mites, aphids, thrips, russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, broad mites, shore flies,
white fly, and others too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rely on Natural Enemies for
expertise and excellent service.

.com forward slash natural enemies or
[SPEAKER_00]: simply click on their banner in this
week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you own a cannabis company,
you know that finding good business
[SPEAKER_00]: partners, vendors, and allies is an
essential part of your role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And building your business in a new
industry like cannabis doesn't always make
[SPEAKER_00]: that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: CannaCon is coming to Boston and Detroit
this summer and the halls will be filled
[SPEAKER_00]: with every kind of ally you need for a
cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology, horticulture, packaging,
marketing, legal human resources and
[SPEAKER_00]: media, everything you need for your
business will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your customers will be there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because CannaCon is a premier cannabis
business and networking event with
[SPEAKER_00]: nationally recognized speakers and the
opportunity to have serious conversations
[SPEAKER_00]: with your business peers and investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reserving yourself a booth at CannaCon can
unlock a lot of doors for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do you get to network with all
the people who pass your booth,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is not uncommon for CannaCon
vendors to do a million dollars in
[SPEAKER_00]: business during the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: CannaCon Seattle event in February sold
out well in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reserve your booths now for Detroit,
June 1st and 2nd, and Boston, July 27th
[SPEAKER_00]: and 28th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attendee tickets are still available for
both events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you reserve a booth or attend just
for a day, do not miss the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: become a serious player in your market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit cannacon.org for tickets,
booth reservations, and more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cannacon.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Losanar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this week is Seth Crawford,
co-founder of Oregon CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this last section, we're going to
talk a little bit about legality and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about the future of CBD-derived hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first of all, I want to hit on the
Reggie Gaudino interview that we had last
[SPEAKER_00]: week, all about intellectual property and
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that it excited you and
engaged you in a lot of very important
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to give you the floor so
that you can kind of speak to the topic
[SPEAKER_00]: last week of protecting these important
cultivars that you are developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was an excellent interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd really appreciate you just making the
time and Reggie for making the time to
[SPEAKER_01]: have that conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an incredibly important
moment in time for the entire cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having moved from a system where each
individual breeder was doing their own
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and generally in small ways,
but others doing it in larger ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a new legal environment in place
has, I think, changed the calculations for
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we have done is
basically what Reggie was advocating for,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is to preemptively file patents
to protect the breeding technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeding approach that we use to
create a lot of our varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, whether or not the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patent Office will grant that is obviously
something that we're going to do our best
[SPEAKER_01]: to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that we end up using it,
however, is a lot of people are concerned
[SPEAKER_01]: about individuals or corporations holding
these patents and then excluding wide
[SPEAKER_01]: swaths of certain types of plants or
chemotypes or terpene profiles from the
[SPEAKER_01]: general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that we're very concerned
with as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously not something that we would
be doing, but it raises this really
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated issue for people who are
investing a significant amount of time and
[SPEAKER_01]: energy and money into the development of
unique cultivars or chemotypes or even
[SPEAKER_01]: just potential breeding strategies like
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There needs to be some sort of way to stop
those bigger companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that's always raised is Monsanto,
and soon to be called Monsanto Bay or Bay
[SPEAKER_01]: or Monsanto or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: $2.5 billion in research every single year
is a substantial amount, and that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: something that we can compete with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the folks that are out in
front on this are preemptively trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect the work that they're doing,
and there are others who are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that all of the previous work is
accounted for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out in the public domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting times, to say the least,
but it's something that I think that a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot, as Reggie highlighted, I think
cultivators and breeders would be very
[SPEAKER_01]: wise to look into the potential for doing
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and competing with their $2.6
billion R&D budget is only the half of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because their legal budget is insane as
well, and they may be able to develop the
[SPEAKER_00]: same things as smaller cultivators are
working on with that kind of R&D budget,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also trying to defend your chemovars
or cultivars or techniques against
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody like Bay or Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's its own problem that doesn't even
take place in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens in the courtroom and in
briefs and is just as ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk for a second about one of your
most valuable strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your whole line is unique for their own
reasons, but I know that you are excited
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as a lot of patients I know are
excited about your CBG strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you talk a little bit about that
and your hopes of protecting that so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can share it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, CBG is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible in terms of its pain
relief, muscle spasms, spasticity.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a topical, it's great for eczema and
psoriasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those compounds that once
you've tried it, it's mind bending to say
[SPEAKER_01]: the least that it's just been tucked away
for so long inside of the cannabis genome
[SPEAKER_01]: and is now just popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited to be able to bring
that to the table for farmers in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, it's not just one variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's between seven and nine
individual lines that we're working on
[SPEAKER_01]: that have very different approaches and
different practical applications,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's for the production of field
production with harvests using combines or
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene rich varieties that will be hand
harvested in the same way that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the finest flowers are still grown for THC
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: A number of different options,
different flavors, and different
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some that are 100 to 1 CBG to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have other varieties that we've now
developed that are over 300 to 1 CBG to
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, which means that you can do an oil
extraction, a basic rough oil extraction,
[SPEAKER_01]: and still be below the 0.3% THC limitation
at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely some game changing things that
are coming out and will be available to
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers for 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG, since people don't spend a lot of
time using it on its own, it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: as much of a rep as other parts of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, when you come across CBG,
it's not going to be in a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, it's because it's
extracted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proof was in the pudding when we
visited your farm and we tried a dab of
[SPEAKER_00]: your CBG rich strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left your sampling booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, I didn't think I felt anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I realized I was in a really good
mood and kind of felt like I was walking
[SPEAKER_00]: on clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my associate I brought with me,
he's got lifelong pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that particular day, his leg was all
flared up and he was uncomfortable in my
[SPEAKER_00]: car and it was a drag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got back out to my car and we're
driving away and he nudges me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, dude, I don't hurt and my leg's
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, no, you don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we first started talking about
how we talk about CBD being 20 to one all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time and how nice it is to be able to
get cannabidiol into folks with a low
[SPEAKER_00]: amount, just trace amounts of THC,
especially kids who don't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: lethargic at school through their parents,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the CBG, 100 to one CBG and that
is a powerful pain reliever, this opens up
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole new field of cannabis clinical
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that they're gonna be giving their
dabs though.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be perfectly blunt, I think that
America would be a better place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think every place in the world would be
better off if every adult had a CBG pen,
[SPEAKER_01]: a vape pen in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you described, it's not psychoactive
but it's also, I describe it as being a
[SPEAKER_01]: profound experience in the sense that it
provides a significant amount of mental
[SPEAKER_01]: clarity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are anxious or if you've had too
much caffeine or you're tense,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a non-psychoactive relaxer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It calms people down in addition to having
all of those different pain relieving
[SPEAKER_01]: properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never want to be making proclamations
that are a little bit of a reach but I do
[SPEAKER_01]: think that for a lot of people who suffer
from chronic pain, this is one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing substances that will help them not
take opiates.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more cannabinoids that we have at our
disposal to be able to deal with things
[SPEAKER_01]: like opiates, the better off we're all
going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are really looking forward to seeing
thousands of acres of this in production
[SPEAKER_01]: in the coming months.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the coming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got seed for these strains
coming out next year, I take it that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are following Reggie Gaudino's strategy
and defensively patenting it in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that we're not releasing it to
farmers though is for the same reason that
[SPEAKER_01]: the varieties that you saw in the field
last year are the seed, the test crop for
[SPEAKER_01]: what farmers are growing this season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do field trials to make sure that we're
doing accurate progeny testing so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can make the best seed possible for
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know of any other companies that
do that outside of general agriculture and
[SPEAKER_01]: seed production for other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically just tried to mirror that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've taken our success and built a
genomics lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing in-house testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do these large scale field trials to
make sure that the product that goes out
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to perform exactly the way that
we say it is because we know it really
[SPEAKER_01]: well and B are telling the truth based on
legitimate field applications of the
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the goal this season.
[SPEAKER_01]: This summer is we're growing out all of
these different new creations and finding
[SPEAKER_01]: out which ones work and which ones don't
from a farming perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because a lot of these seeds,
there's a big difference between growing
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 plants in your yard versus growing 25
acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture is a whole different animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: To that point, you need a lot of seeds to
be able to grow that many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I saw when you had your
announcements of seed sales this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had way more people interested than
you had seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were showing up to your seed sale
days and essentially buying out your whole
[SPEAKER_00]: run on that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've been watching your posts about
your seed manufacturing structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just give me a little bit idea of
how much you've chosen to scale up and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you think that you're going to meet demand
this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'll be able to meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's probably a stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to be able to meet the
demand for this season.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crazy part is that people come out of
the woodwork between now and May 1st and
[SPEAKER_01]: large orders are definitely happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went from being able to produce
basically about five million seeds per
[SPEAKER_01]: year to being able to produce 50 million
per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: This summer, we're going to be scaling
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 500 lights between our three main
production facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're scaling that up to 2,000 lights so
that we can produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year, we'll be able to produce about
100 million seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing everything that we can to make
sure that this is a viable large-scale
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural crop for as many farmers as
we can possibly get into the farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird, too, because just producing
those seeds is like running an entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: separate company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all these seeds in your R&D
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're machine trimming it and sending it
to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, we've got these four or five
locations with 200 lights producing this
[SPEAKER_00]: epic volume of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That itself sounds like a hassle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do it all indoors, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As you were complaining about your
neighbor that pollinated the whole valley,
[SPEAKER_00]: you instead are doing it in very tightly
controlled areas with vacuums that pull in
[SPEAKER_00]: inside and everything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very sealed up manufacturing
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nice part about what we're doing is
growing inside, is the only way to really
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that you're going to have a quality
product that's not contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about this before,
but one male, one legitimate male,
[SPEAKER_01]: one pollen grain from a male plant would
destroy a crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have to basically get rid of all
of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality is of the utmost concern for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a farmer ends up with one plant in
their entire field that is sampled by the
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Agriculture, if it's a type
two plant, if it's a one to one,
[SPEAKER_01]: that one plant would make them fail their
compliance test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do everything in our power to make the
production side sealed, clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: and not worrying about pollen
contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also flower in the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when we're making all of our seeds
so that we can miss the large potential
[SPEAKER_01]: plumes of outdoor pollen just in case it's
going on during the regular harvest
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even after all of that, we still grow out
these test batches and do our PCR screen
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure that there are no Y
chromosomes in our gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: When farmers are getting seed from us,
they can reasonably assume that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to perform as we've claimed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to back that up with
basically 21st century science being
[SPEAKER_01]: brought to bear on this ancient,
awesome agricultural crop that we've all
[SPEAKER_01]: been growing for generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woo-hoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to this summer,
what do you see as being some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting hot points?
[SPEAKER_00]: Last summer, you were super shocked in a
good way because you didn't get pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: with somebody else's seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, instead of having CBD-rich
flour for extraction, you actually had CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: flour that was Sensemio without seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was much more valuable than you have
had planned, but it created a kink in your
[SPEAKER_00]: business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see as being potential changes
that could happen either for your business
[SPEAKER_00]: model or for the industry in general this
coming summer?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be determined, I've given up on
forecasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes so dramatically and so
radically every season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that for us and for our company,
we've gone through tremendous growth in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are trying to devote ourselves fully to
the process of creating seed and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: good field trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that we're going to be doing
trim flour again this season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an awesome one-off last year and it
worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us to be able to focus on the breeding
and not just CBG, but all of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: minor cannabinoids that are basically
coming online, it's better testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really where our focus is and being
able to create varieties that will succeed
[SPEAKER_01]: and thrive in other areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a lot of custom breeding
projects right now for, say, tropical
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally different environments that we're
not accustomed to and we don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to in the summer for us to
grow here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had to build out climate-controlled
environments to replicate those very high
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of humidity, very warm,
basically trying to do controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments to develop varieties that will
work in other areas as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's all really inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us, from patients to product
manufacturers to entrepreneurs to
[SPEAKER_00]: retailers, we are all looking for your
success so that you can bring a wider
[SPEAKER_00]: array of Canvas products to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep on the good fight, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for being on the show,
