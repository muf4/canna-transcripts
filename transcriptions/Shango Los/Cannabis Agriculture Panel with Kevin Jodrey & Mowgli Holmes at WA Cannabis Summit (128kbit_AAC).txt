[SPEAKER_05]: Cindy Cooper, can you start it off please?
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Cindy Cooper, I'm with the Washington
State Department of Agriculture Plant
[SPEAKER_17]: Protection Division I've been with the
agency for 17 years and before that I was
[SPEAKER_17]: in the nursery industry so I have some
understanding of nursery issues and
[SPEAKER_17]: consider many of you to be nursery men and
women as well I wanted to point out that
[SPEAKER_17]: Washington ranks second in the nation only
behind California in the production of
[SPEAKER_17]: specialty crops and we have a huge
diversity of crops that are produced here
[SPEAKER_17]: in the state with over 300 different ag
commodities produced by Washington growers
[SPEAKER_17]: so there's a lot of agricultural resources
research done here of course our
[SPEAKER_17]: universities, our land grant college are
all primary to supporting these
[SPEAKER_17]: agricultural industries with research that
will assist growers in doing the best job
[SPEAKER_17]: of growing plants our agency specifically
does provide money for research to benefit
[SPEAKER_17]: the nursery industry we do that through
licensing fees all nurseries in the state
[SPEAKER_17]: of Washington are required to be licensed
cannabis growers are exempted from that in
[SPEAKER_17]: the original legislation that was put in
place we also represent the department on
[SPEAKER_17]: commodity commissions and these
commissions are primary movers and shakers
[SPEAKER_17]: when it comes to providing funding for
research for marketing as well but mostly
[SPEAKER_17]: research and so one of the things that I
think this new agricultural industry needs
[SPEAKER_17]: is a commodity commission I hope you'll
pursue that
[SPEAKER_17]: that just provides you a funding mechanism
for all the agricultural research that
[SPEAKER_17]: needs to be done around this crop so that
needs to be in place so that when the time
[SPEAKER_17]: comes that federal things change and
universities are able to work on research
[SPEAKER_17]: for cannabis more freely that this is all
in place and you'll have that system to
[SPEAKER_17]: fall back on another thing the Department
of Ag does is we manage voluntary planting
[SPEAKER_17]: stock certification programs and what that
means is most of your large industries in
[SPEAKER_17]: Washington like apples, grapes,
those all have clean planting stock for
[SPEAKER_17]: orchardists and vineyardists to plant in
their operations that's something that's a
[SPEAKER_17]: primary mission of my program so these
vines and apple trees are produced through
[SPEAKER_17]: a system of clean planting stock best
management practices these are written in
[SPEAKER_17]: rule it's certainly something that would
be applicable applicable to any egg
[SPEAKER_17]: industry or any egg crop so we can provide
the best management practices around which
[SPEAKER_17]: you can build a system of producing clean
virus-free planting material so the
[SPEAKER_17]: components of that program are pretty
consistent it would involve developing a
[SPEAKER_17]: system where you've got isolation from
infected plants where you've got testing
[SPEAKER_17]: that can be done on your mother plants
that would show that they're free of
[SPEAKER_17]: viruses and other diseases and this is
going to reduce losses, increase yields,
[SPEAKER_17]: and make a more robust market for cannabis
so producing clean pest-free plants is
[SPEAKER_17]: based on these best management practices
and I've brought with me today a little
[SPEAKER_17]: list I put together just based on my own
experience with nurseries best management
[SPEAKER_17]: practices in all sorts of different parts
of your growing operation that could be
[SPEAKER_17]: helpful so I encourage everyone to come up
and get a handout today suggested best
[SPEAKER_17]: management practices to exclude pests and
diseases in greenhouses and outdoor
[SPEAKER_17]: production facilities go way beyond IPM
most growers do a lot of these things
[SPEAKER_17]: monitoring for pests, treating when
there's an economic threshold reached but
[SPEAKER_17]: best management practice systems are
endorsed by national organizations like
[SPEAKER_17]: the National Plant Board, Washington State
University, other university extension
[SPEAKER_17]: programs so these are well established in
something that this new industry can take
[SPEAKER_17]: advantage of the handout also has some
links to different BMP websites you can
[SPEAKER_17]: look at as well University of California
Davis has done a lot of work with that the
[SPEAKER_17]: major components to consider when you're
designing a best management plan for your
[SPEAKER_17]: growing operation are considering all the
inputs to that system these are called
[SPEAKER_17]: critical control points and these would
include plants you bring in from outside
[SPEAKER_17]: your operation the soil or growing media
that you're putting them in the containers
[SPEAKER_17]: that you're using making sure those are
sanitized to begin with the watering
[SPEAKER_17]: system, the tools you use and the movement
of people and equipment throughout that
[SPEAKER_17]: operation these are all things that need
to be considered as critical control
[SPEAKER_17]: points so starting with clean plants
propagated from clean mother stock and
[SPEAKER_17]: that were tested for viruses and disease
pathogens is primary to this and there is
[SPEAKER_17]: a national system called the National
Clean Plant Network which does a lot of
[SPEAKER_17]: this work for other major commodities like
apples, grape vines, hops for instance and
[SPEAKER_17]: so the National Clean Plant Network would
be a potential resource for information
[SPEAKER_17]: and maybe eventually producing
foundational material for growers to use
[SPEAKER_17]: that's already been tested and is known to
be virus free
[SPEAKER_17]: the same clean plant model could be a good
one to count as production but you need
[SPEAKER_17]: research on what are the common viruses
what are viroids and diseases that are
[SPEAKER_17]: prevalent throughout the system these are
not things you can see necessarily through
[SPEAKER_17]: visual symptoms but they're still there so
they do affect production so research
[SPEAKER_17]: again primary to getting this going one
thing I want to point out is that by the
[SPEAKER_17]: way I can't see that by the minute I can't
see that at all one of the real basic best
[SPEAKER_17]: management practices that you could use in
any operation would be the use of heat as
[SPEAKER_17]: a killer of pathogens, steam would be a
way to clean all your pots and surfaces
[SPEAKER_17]: and instruments and anything you're using
in your grow operation consider your
[SPEAKER_17]: growing mix media to be a carrier of
fungal pathogens that's very possible and
[SPEAKER_17]: so the use of sterilized or pasteurized
growing media might be another very
[SPEAKER_17]: important best management practice staff
training, making sure that you educate
[SPEAKER_17]: your workers to recognize disease symptoms
and insect pests and to know what to do
[SPEAKER_17]: about it when you see them early detection
of course is critical to solving those
[SPEAKER_17]: problems taking photos and symptoms and
asking experts to ID them would be a good
[SPEAKER_17]: way to do it since right now it may not be
possible to remove plant material to a lab
[SPEAKER_17]: that could diagnose a disease for you
training all staff on best management
[SPEAKER_17]: practices and sanitation processes writing
it down having an annual that you adhere
[SPEAKER_17]: to in your business as you are producing
your plants lots of nurseries do this in
[SPEAKER_17]: other systems around the country and they
found it really helpful to just
[SPEAKER_17]: standardizing their practices and making
sure everybody's doing the same thing of
[SPEAKER_17]: course mechanical transmission of pests by
the movement of employees through the
[SPEAKER_17]: plants is one major way of spreading
disease vectors and insects so making sure
[SPEAKER_17]: that when your staff is working on plants
they move from the cleanest area to the
[SPEAKER_17]: area that might be more invested with
avids or white flags or something like
[SPEAKER_17]: that so you keep those clean plants
uncontaminated cleaning groomers between
[SPEAKER_17]: plants when you're taking cuttings or
cutting up material cleaning and
[SPEAKER_17]: sanitizing clothing and making sure that
the shoes people are wearing are dedicated
[SPEAKER_17]: to that clean environment putting squishy
pads at every door opening that goes to
[SPEAKER_17]: the outside these are common nursery
practices in growing operation that could
[SPEAKER_17]: all be used by cannabis growers as well
but I guess the take-home message is that
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis growers need the same
agricultural support network that is
[SPEAKER_17]: available to all their egg crops commodity
Commission funding for university research
[SPEAKER_17]: standard of grades clean plants growing
systems and best management practices and
[SPEAKER_17]: these resources exist they're out there
and hopefully can be adopted by the vast
[SPEAKER_17]: majority of cannabis growers here in
Washington
[SPEAKER_03]: thank you good morning everyone thanks for
coming and thank you to the Alliance for
[SPEAKER_03]: inviting me I'm very happy and proud to be
here today I want to start out saying I've
[SPEAKER_03]: never grown cannabis ever but just what
Sydney was talking about everything
[SPEAKER_03]: applies I worked with a number of crops
and that you know started in the mid-1980s
[SPEAKER_03]: working as a soils research assistant
while studying for a forestry degree I
[SPEAKER_03]: moved into forestry IPM which was kind of
a new thing at the time working for the
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan DNR and scouting for jack pine
bud work quickly got involved with
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture because IPM was huge at the
time and there was nobody who had any IPM
[SPEAKER_03]: experience so I did nothing about farming
but I spent some time in IPM in the forest
[SPEAKER_03]: and talked to some growers in upstate New
York and I was the only one they
[SPEAKER_03]: interviewed that had any IPM experience so
I got hired I learned how to fly from
[SPEAKER_03]: growers about agriculture so working on a
number of crops up there mostly vegetable
[SPEAKER_03]: crops quickly got into more education
doing a master's in plant protection at
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell University and then becoming an
integrated crop management specialist in
[SPEAKER_03]: the state of New York regional IPM
specialist 14 county and region in
[SPEAKER_03]: southeast New York in a number of crops
and then getting into nursery greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: sports turf and other ornamentals so a big
array of crops in integrated pest
[SPEAKER_03]: management up into the 90s from there I
moved to Michigan and kept the IPM thing
[SPEAKER_03]: going in commercial corn and soybeans in
the Midwest but then was hired as the
[SPEAKER_03]: project manager for the long-term
ecological research project in row crop
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture if you don't know what LTER is
I suggest you look it up it's an NSF
[SPEAKER_03]: program that's been going on since the 80s
and it's big Michigan is the largest
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural ecosystem project in the US
and I was fortunate enough to manage that
[SPEAKER_03]: project for 10 years and simultaneously
work on a PhD looking at transitioning
[SPEAKER_03]: conventional cropping systems to organic
because one of our treatments in that LTR
[SPEAKER_03]: was an organic system and farmers would
show up and say what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: you know we were trying to maximize our
productivity in our system we were
[SPEAKER_03]: basically looking at baseline data of an
organic system so farmers had all kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: advice and based on the region and the
farmer advice I pitched an idea to do a
[SPEAKER_03]: PhD in transitional systems looking at the
economics the soil dynamics and the wheat
[SPEAKER_03]: seed bank transitioning from conventional
to organic so there's three years you have
[SPEAKER_03]: to be out of you know any prohibited
substances in order to be certified
[SPEAKER_03]: organic and at the time you know this is
when the label just came in to the OCA in
[SPEAKER_03]: 2002 a lot of farmers thought they had to
lose money for three years in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: transition so I wanted to look at that
using some of the advice of the local
[SPEAKER_03]: growers as to how best to manage those
systems so all that academic stuff you
[SPEAKER_03]: know writing papers and everything that's
that's all well and good but my favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: thing to do is to work with farmers
because I learned from farmers they always
[SPEAKER_03]: have good ideas you're not afraid to tell
you about them and I often learn more from
[SPEAKER_03]: the growers than I do from the books or
from the ivory tile so after the PhD in
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan I got a position out here as the
ag faculty for WSU in Snowman County
[SPEAKER_03]: Extension and we have a number of organic
and conventional growers which is
[SPEAKER_03]: different from back in the Midwest because
they really do learn a lot from each other
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't disparage each other there's
kind of a bigger hard line between the two
[SPEAKER_03]: in the Midwest at least there was back
then and these things these days out here
[SPEAKER_03]: it's interesting to see how a lot of the
conventional growers look to organic
[SPEAKER_03]: growers for advice so I spent eight years
doing that and got started getting into so
[SPEAKER_03]: you mentioned the specialty crops we are a
big specialty crop state and once you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: are federalized you will be considered a
specialty crop there's no question
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is a specialty crop so I looked
for some money through that program to
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of look at our compost situation here
in the Northwest we got surplus compost
[SPEAKER_03]: all over the place growers who may or may
not be composting their own stuff some
[SPEAKER_03]: better than others but not a lot of
compost going out on farms so I pitched
[SPEAKER_03]: the idea to the businesses again it's a
block program so WSDA's distributes the
[SPEAKER_03]: money but it's federal money from the USDA
and I said why don't we take some of this
[SPEAKER_03]: surplus compost and try to get farmers to
spread it and we can do some research and
[SPEAKER_03]: some demonstration projects see if we can
get that into the idea so it worked I got
[SPEAKER_03]: the money and I got a three-year project
going with local mostly Snohomish County
[SPEAKER_03]: with some King County growers over 65
growers participated we had three really
[SPEAKER_03]: robust studies where we had randomized
replicated studies statistically
[SPEAKER_03]: significant studies but the rest of them
were just okay we want to try it we'll do
[SPEAKER_03]: a side-by-side demonstration trial and see
how it goes and then we'll report back to
[SPEAKER_03]: you so very successful program the u.s.
[SPEAKER_03]: composting council invited me to come
speak a couple years in a row about the
[SPEAKER_03]: program and in doing that I was attending
conference in Austin Texas of all places
[SPEAKER_03]: and noticed that there was this person
doing us doing a program on anaerobic
[SPEAKER_03]: digestion scale appropriate for individual
growers and he's from Western Washington I
[SPEAKER_03]: never heard of this guy so I went to his
talk and it was all pretty much still on
[SPEAKER_03]: the drawing board hadn't produced any
units yet but obviously knew what he was
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about and wanted to make it happen
so I went up to him after the talk and
[SPEAKER_03]: asked him who he has on staff that knows
how to talk to any farmer because he needs
[SPEAKER_03]: to be working with farmers especially in
Western Washington where there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: direct market a lot of farmers doing their
own marketing their own processing on site
[SPEAKER_03]: where they're not only generating organic
waste on site but can also use that waste
[SPEAKER_03]: once it's digested for both power and
fertilizer on site so if you have a scale
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriate digester on site it basically
takes the whole shipping and diesel out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the equation so he said no I don't have
any money but maybe you can do it and this
[SPEAKER_03]: is where I ended up Impact Bioenergy is a
startup company here in Western Washington
[SPEAKER_03]: we built the units in Auburn we have half
a dozen of them running around the sound
[SPEAKER_03]: right now and I believe that the cannabis
industry could really benefit from this
[SPEAKER_03]: process I know there's some issues with
waste organic waste through the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: production process and I know the rules
are very strict the quarantine time maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: could be utilized with digester that time
spent on site could be digested you can
[SPEAKER_03]: use power to heat your dryer, heat your
greenhouse, light your greenhouse and then
[SPEAKER_03]: reclaim not only the nutrients for
fertilizer in your systems but also the
[SPEAKER_03]: water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water is important we heard earlier how
you save water with your process saving
[SPEAKER_03]: water is a big deal even in Western
Washington where we seem to get a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: it so replanting the water and the
nutrients and using them on site could be
[SPEAKER_03]: a big benefit and you know a shameless
plug for our systems I would love to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: to any growers that are interested I'm
currently doing unfarmed trials in a
[SPEAKER_03]: number of crops I am working with one
cannabis grower in Eastern Washington just
[SPEAKER_03]: using the digest date but I would love to
see how how organic waste you know the
[SPEAKER_03]: floral waste and your foliage waste the
the woody stems those get pretty big I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean those are like tree trunks what I've
seen then you know you can't throw those
[SPEAKER_03]: in a digester but everything else you
probably can and I am not aware of any
[SPEAKER_03]: studies using floral cannabis waste in an
anaerobic digester so I'd love to start
[SPEAKER_03]: some of those trials and see what does it
do what is the end product how does it
[SPEAKER_03]: help does it doesn't anaerobic digester
get the munchies if it's on cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly work with some of you maybe a
collective of you bringing waste through a
[SPEAKER_03]: digester reclaiming the water and using
some of the fertilizer on the product so
[SPEAKER_03]: that's why I think I'm here I have a long
history of ITM experience and so I can
[SPEAKER_03]: cross a lot of what Cindy's done in the
past and just here to help so thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm the founder of a company in Florida
called Phyllis Bioscience or plant science
[SPEAKER_12]: and genomics company we study the cannabis
genome and we sell genetic tests to
[SPEAKER_12]: farmers that help them grow better and
help them understand what they're growing
[SPEAKER_12]: and help them develop new and better
cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think part of our our goal from the
beginning has been to bring this crop into
[SPEAKER_12]: the modern agriculture world just like
everyone on this panel is talking about
[SPEAKER_12]: the basic standards and approaches and the
science of modern act has not been applied
[SPEAKER_12]: to cannabis and there's a lot of reasons
why it needs to be but one thing that has
[SPEAKER_12]: been really clear to us as we go through
every process in bringing this industry
[SPEAKER_12]: into the modern world is that when we go
and we look at how more mature industries
[SPEAKER_12]: do things as a model for how to do things
in this new industry we find that there's
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot of ways that this industry is still
in the dark ages but we also find that the
[SPEAKER_12]: way that mature industries do things can
really suck.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for instance we were trying to write
the testing rules for pesticides in Oregon
[SPEAKER_12]: and we wanted to stop people using
pesticides which was a result of bad act
[SPEAKER_12]: practices and sharing clones and not
understanding good IPI practices all of
[SPEAKER_12]: these things that were rooted in the
history of cannabis combined with these
[SPEAKER_12]: commercial pressures suddenly came to mind
and everyone's using all these pesticides
[SPEAKER_12]: and we wanted to figure out a modern
regulatory system to test for pesticides
[SPEAKER_12]: so we thought let's look at the rest bag
and let's look at how the EPA rated these
[SPEAKER_12]: pesticides and we'll just borrow from
these mature industries but it turns out
[SPEAKER_12]: that those mature industries that really
dive into how they do things how they set
[SPEAKER_12]: pesticide limits how they set toxicity
limits it's just it's terrible like it's
[SPEAKER_12]: not it ends up not being a system you want
to copulate we want to do better than that
[SPEAKER_12]: in the cannabis industry in general so the
same thing is really true for just general
[SPEAKER_12]: agronomic practices I mean there's there's
all this stuff which growers need to learn
[SPEAKER_12]: so badly and there's all kinds of plant
breeding work and facility infrastructure
[SPEAKER_12]: environmental impact stuff where the
cannabis typical cannabis growers just
[SPEAKER_12]: decades behind but when we look how modern
agriculture has worked the results of all
[SPEAKER_12]: the science they've applied have been just
terrible in a lot of cases and we all I
[SPEAKER_12]: think our goal as a company is to help
steer this industry down a different path
[SPEAKER_12]: so for instance right now cannabis isn't
developed as an agricultural crop it
[SPEAKER_12]: hasn't been through all three various
years of plant breeding that corn and
[SPEAKER_12]: wheat barley every other major crop has
been through and so it's not adapted to
[SPEAKER_12]: specific latitudes it doesn't have harvest
optimization traits it doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_12]: basic pesticides traits that are in every
other crop so cannabis it's closest
[SPEAKER_12]: relative is hops and hops get powdery
mildew just like cannabis does but in hops
[SPEAKER_12]: we know these six different resistance
markers for powdery mildew resistance and
[SPEAKER_12]: we know how to breed and grow hops that
doesn't get wiped out because of weed and
[SPEAKER_12]: we don't we just don't know how to do that
in cannabis here so as we start to apply
[SPEAKER_12]: all this science and start to improve our
practices and start to improve the crop
[SPEAKER_12]: itself what's gonna happen if we're not
alert is we're gonna go the same way that
[SPEAKER_12]: the rest of the ag is going so in the corn
world we used to have a hundred years ago
[SPEAKER_12]: we had 200 250 varieties of corn in this
country and as big ag companies started to
[SPEAKER_12]: do progressive breeding and they're
looking for these elite cultivars that are
[SPEAKER_12]: higher yielding and they're perfectly
optimized they were able to find these
[SPEAKER_12]: incredible varieties and drive them
forward and create higher and higher
[SPEAKER_12]: yields and what they ended up with were
these elite cultivars that are currently
[SPEAKER_12]: hiding within but paradoxically they've
made our food security situation way worse
[SPEAKER_12]: because we didn't protect the existing
diversity that was there before all of
[SPEAKER_12]: that diversity is gone we're totally
dependent on just a small handful of elite
[SPEAKER_12]: varieties that are dependent on crazy
amounts of chemical input to even function
[SPEAKER_12]: and those are monocultures they can be
wiped out in a second by a single disease
[SPEAKER_12]: so bananas are at risk for that now the
Irish potato famine was the result of
[SPEAKER_12]: nationwide planting of one clonal cultivar
so contrary to what the present
[SPEAKER_12]: administration might have you think
diversity is what makes populations really
[SPEAKER_12]: strong you can't just have a couple of
varieties and if big ag comes in and they
[SPEAKER_12]: start doing things the way they do it they
will just grow fields and fields and
[SPEAKER_12]: fields of the highly optimized blue dream
and that's not what we want so one of the
[SPEAKER_12]: things that we did at the youngs and
starting non-profit called the open
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis project I don't work with them
directly anymore but I think they have
[SPEAKER_12]: some reps here and their goal is to
protect all the existing diversity because
[SPEAKER_12]: we know that I mean our goals are at odds
right we want to grow tons of
[SPEAKER_12]: high-yielding cannabis we want to develop
new varieties that are better improved but
[SPEAKER_12]: we also want to preserve all the genetic
diversity that's out there right now so
[SPEAKER_12]: what the open cannabis project does is
they just collect data from companies like
[SPEAKER_12]: ours like we've been sequencing cannabis
genome data from all over the world for
[SPEAKER_12]: four years now and we take all that data
and we give it to the open cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: project and they make it public they're
collecting data from testing labs and all
[SPEAKER_12]: that data serves as proof that these
varieties have been in existence because
[SPEAKER_12]: there's no proof of that right now that
the patent office can see and so it makes
[SPEAKER_12]: it harder for big companies to patent
varieties and restrict their use and if we
[SPEAKER_12]: continue to do that and share data and
take more of an open source approach to
[SPEAKER_12]: things it's going to be possible for the
community to protect all the actually very
[SPEAKER_12]: rich and bizarrely complex diversity that
exists out there with cannabis right now
[SPEAKER_12]: and if we do that we'll have that
diversity to draw on for years and years
[SPEAKER_12]: and years and we can keep working with the
plant and making it more and more
[SPEAKER_12]: interesting we can be breeding it so that
the pest resistance so that it's not such
[SPEAKER_12]: a black art keeping the PM off your plants
and we can make these incredible new
[SPEAKER_12]: varieties but we still have this rich
background to draw on so thank you that's
[SPEAKER_12]: all I have before
[SPEAKER_05]: we move on to Kevin there has been a
technology question asked that we're going
[SPEAKER_05]: to answer right now just take a second so
for all of you that are asking about Wi-Fi
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 years ago IHG connect password 988
[SPEAKER_05]: so my name is Kevin Jones thank you very
much for showing up today allow me to
[SPEAKER_13]: speak in front of you it's always a
pleasure to come to Washington you're an
[SPEAKER_13]: exceptional audience to get to work with
my background is pretty expensive in terms
[SPEAKER_14]: of a lot of ways 41 years and I always
believe we would end up here I knew at
[SPEAKER_14]: some point that candidates would become
accepted in a different view and I
[SPEAKER_14]: approached it from that point of view and
so I try to understand as much as I could
[SPEAKER_14]: about what I was doing so that I would
have a future I believe at some point I
[SPEAKER_14]: would end up here and I knew that I would
have to be allowed a skill set to survive
[SPEAKER_14]: so to speak and a lot of my study in
cannabis and work in cannabis was trying
[SPEAKER_14]: to understand primarily how does one get
cannabis to the table which means how do
[SPEAKER_14]: we get it to the market and that's really
the most important thing to me because
[SPEAKER_14]: that dictates everything backwards and
then when you put ethics with it you
[SPEAKER_14]: actually have a pretty sustainable
situation so we combine how do we get
[SPEAKER_14]: product to the table and how do we do it
in an ethical manner and I think that what
[SPEAKER_14]: you have with cannabis is it was held in
check for so long that what we did was we
[SPEAKER_14]: created an entire library of genetics that
were improperly sourced what we did all
[SPEAKER_14]: these years is we chose cannabis for
stealth so we took away a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: desirability and smell and we used all
these illegal pesticides and fungicides
[SPEAKER_14]: and EGRs plant growth regulators to assist
us and what happened over all these years
[SPEAKER_14]: decades is that we created a gene pool
that's weak we chose varieties that were
[SPEAKER_14]: trendy and we bred them too heavily and we
bottled them and so what you have is you
[SPEAKER_14]: have this incredible population of
cannabis varieties that we use that are
[SPEAKER_14]: inherently prone to all these different
pathogenic problems pest problems
[SPEAKER_14]: inherently weak in certain certain
circumstances exceptionally hungry for
[SPEAKER_14]: exceptionally high nutrient levels because
everyone always gave their plants the most
[SPEAKER_14]: fertile soil the best situation and when
you select in that situation what you
[SPEAKER_14]: select is plants that thrive in perfection
I call it live in their vacuum what I want
[SPEAKER_14]: to see is a plant that really got
mistreated in a horrible situation that
[SPEAKER_14]: didn't get fed that's the plant I really
want to see because that's the one that we
[SPEAKER_14]: actually work with and so I'm known in
cannabis as a nursery operator but I have
[SPEAKER_14]: a farm so I'm kind of vertical so I have a
lot of stuff going on but I'm known
[SPEAKER_14]: primarily for nursery work and in
California I basically created the modern
[SPEAKER_14]: nursery model in terms of the walk-in
store nursery front it was never done
[SPEAKER_14]: prior to that and I created the nursery
model from dispensaries where the
[SPEAKER_14]: dispensary itself created the stock so the
last 10 years I've been applying what I
[SPEAKER_14]: learned in the 30 years prior and for all
of that what we found was that most
[SPEAKER_14]: cultivators are basically praying for
success and they're unfortunately praying
[SPEAKER_14]: in the wrong direction because what they
do is they choose products that are trendy
[SPEAKER_14]: with no consideration for where they're
going to cultivate it and with no
[SPEAKER_14]: consideration for cultivation
methodologies or the operators and no
[SPEAKER_14]: diversity and what happens is that you
will use OG Kush as an example just
[SPEAKER_14]: because it's just such a hot move from
where we live in California so everyone
[SPEAKER_14]: wants to grow OG but OG is a massive
family so depending on what cultivar of OG
[SPEAKER_14]: you get you might get one that's
exceptionally powdery milky prone,
[SPEAKER_14]: exceptionally Petritus prone, now we have
russet and broad white that are everywhere
[SPEAKER_14]: prone to those also epidural layers are
thick enough doesn't resist and so people
[SPEAKER_14]: use these inferior cultivars and they
wonder why they're getting a little crap
[SPEAKER_14]: kicked off from the entire time they
cultivate and so what we tried to do
[SPEAKER_14]: through the normal nursery model was to
population sips so what I do is I go
[SPEAKER_14]: through large populations of plants and we
find the outliers we find plants that have
[SPEAKER_14]: an ability to resist naturally and this is
a normal agricultural practice I'm lucky
[SPEAKER_14]: in that I get to tour all kinds of neat
facilities I get to see some really
[SPEAKER_14]: interesting stuff but I get to go and do a
tour of the largest redwood nursery
[SPEAKER_14]: propagation facility in the world so Green
Diamond is the world's largest redwood
[SPEAKER_14]: producer they're also the largest redwood
nursery I get to talk to their lead grower
[SPEAKER_14]: who's been cultivating there for 48 years
he's involved in a breeding project that
[SPEAKER_14]: will take 150 years and so he only carries
the first third of the program but he took
[SPEAKER_14]: me out into his mother library so to speak
which was acres and acres of forest and it
[SPEAKER_14]: was from every thousand acres of redwoods
the biologists selected one as the
[SPEAKER_14]: greatest of that thousand acres and they
brought that element and so I get to tour
[SPEAKER_14]: entire forests with nothing of these trees
but that had been selected from thousand
[SPEAKER_14]: acre lots and one of these trees was
number 48 and it was I think a hundred and
[SPEAKER_14]: eighty percent greater growth than any
other redwood ever recorded but they were
[SPEAKER_14]: intelligent enough to not monocrop it they
did not monocrop that cultivar what they
[SPEAKER_14]: did is they put it so many miles from the
other plants they worked with so that
[SPEAKER_14]: these patches these 40-50 acre forests of
that specific were laid out so they had a
[SPEAKER_14]: diversity so even though it's within the
same family the cultivars have been
[SPEAKER_14]: separated and for redwood it takes about
130-140 years to do seed propagation and
[SPEAKER_14]: so his phrase was it takes 150 years
before she gets sexy I saw something that
[SPEAKER_14]: made me understand that what we're doing
now is we're in the beginning of this
[SPEAKER_14]: we're the foundation of this California's
only legal for four days
[SPEAKER_14]: we're the foundation of this modern
cannabis world in terms of how do we
[SPEAKER_14]: approach cultivar selection how do we
approach most people have no clue what
[SPEAKER_14]: that means it's a it's a label off a pair
of hands maybe because really most
[SPEAKER_14]: cultivators in cannabis have never been in
mainstream the majority people why should
[SPEAKER_14]: we look at historical you guys have been
legal for a while now so it's been very
[SPEAKER_14]: eye-opening to come here for years that I
have because you get to see integration at
[SPEAKER_14]: a level that we don't have in California
in California they have a much looser
[SPEAKER_14]: situation where I get to work with a
tremendous number of professors from
[SPEAKER_14]: universities scientists from private
organizations because they can't touch
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis it's they can't have it in their
hands so to speak they can't have it at
[SPEAKER_14]: the school they can't have it at the
facilities so they find guys like me that
[SPEAKER_14]: are willing to play detective and we chase
problems so we look through cultivars to
[SPEAKER_14]: see what is this and they come in and
analyze and say this one is virally
[SPEAKER_14]: effective this one's not let's see what
happens when we grow and so what you might
[SPEAKER_14]: start happening is you start having this
this intersection between the science
[SPEAKER_14]: component and the actual ag component
because the two of them are in radically
[SPEAKER_14]: different worlds and to me science is it's
an understanding but it's a vacuum you got
[SPEAKER_14]: the whole variables constant in order to
solve for X you can't do that as a farmer
[SPEAKER_14]: and I've farmed too and I've been farming
for really long time and on an organic
[SPEAKER_14]: level and so it's it's an attempt to try
to understand how does one as a farmer
[SPEAKER_14]: take the information from normal
agricultural practices that are I say
[SPEAKER_14]: organically based biologically driven and
then apply it to what we do and actually
[SPEAKER_14]: have some success and you're seeing
ketchup mostly I don't like ketchup I like
[SPEAKER_14]: mustard and so ketchup is where you have a
problem and then you try to figure out how
[SPEAKER_14]: to solve and what we have to be able to
understand with some of this stuff going
[SPEAKER_14]: on is how people proactive in our approach
and like I said prior for me I like to
[SPEAKER_14]: work off populations what I find is that
if I want to get a good friend you might
[SPEAKER_14]: find it in a group of two you might find
it a little better that's with 200 you
[SPEAKER_14]: might find a really decent person in a
group of 2,000 you get to 20,000 you're
[SPEAKER_14]: gonna find something exceptional and
that's how I see cannabis called the bar
[SPEAKER_14]: selection too is the population and it's
been very difficult for us we've been
[SPEAKER_14]: learning these black market operations for
years so these incredible populations that
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been working with are highly illegal
now they're not and I've been legally guys
[SPEAKER_14]: a farm operator for years but all the R&D
all the work all the prior stuff that was
[SPEAKER_14]: all through the desire for people who
really were into cannabis where you were
[SPEAKER_14]: really about it willing to take the risk
to hunt the product that was going to work
[SPEAKER_14]: for you whatever your needs were if that
was economic needs those are fine and if
[SPEAKER_14]: it was for medicinal needs then perfect
and if it's the personal use that's great
[SPEAKER_14]: but it requires you to be able to have
enough of an ability to understand what is
[SPEAKER_14]: it you're seeking and how you ascertain
that and what we've tried to do is we've
[SPEAKER_14]: tried to take these cultivars from these
big populations and then I use these
[SPEAKER_14]: technology to map them and what it does it
allows people not only to be able to find
[SPEAKER_14]: that cultivar that we know is
exceptionally pathogenically resistant
[SPEAKER_14]: cultivars that we have that are
exceptionally prone to problems I call
[SPEAKER_14]: even if they're desired because of their
they're too risky for cultivators to take
[SPEAKER_14]: a gamble on and so what happens is you end
up having to neck down the populations you
[SPEAKER_14]: work with you have to find specific
cultivars the markets trendy but when you
[SPEAKER_14]: chase those trends you'll chase yourself
right into some bankruptcy and what we try
[SPEAKER_14]: to recommend to individuals is a diversity
in terms of what would be diverse in terms
[SPEAKER_14]: of resistance so that we have the greatest
chance of survival of a portion of the
[SPEAKER_14]: crop and then we work on diversity in
terms of market velocity how fast those
[SPEAKER_14]: products move through the system so you
have things that are trending them very
[SPEAKER_14]: quickly but they're in smaller markets and
things that are very stable and in
[SPEAKER_14]: movement larger markets but lower price
points and so you try to get this weird
[SPEAKER_14]: intersection of what is the plant that
you're trying to work with and how do you
[SPEAKER_14]: get it to function for you in a way that
you need the concept about monoculture is
[SPEAKER_14]: an important one and we just had this
discussion this morning about the banana
[SPEAKER_14]: and so the banana I think in the 50s and
60s it was a song there'd be no more
[SPEAKER_14]: bananas well that's because it was no more
bananas they had a fusarium outbreak that
[SPEAKER_14]: wiped out all the bananas and so they find
another banana called it's called the
[SPEAKER_14]: Cavendish the Cavendish cultivar so they
find the Cavendish cultivar in another
[SPEAKER_14]: country and they introduce it and lo and
behold it works great and it's resistant
[SPEAKER_14]: to fusarium and everybody's happy but why
did that cultivar really succeed it wasn't
[SPEAKER_14]: for the resistance as much as you thought
it was because it didn't have to be
[SPEAKER_14]: refrigerated when you moved it it could
handle 45 to 55 degrees on movement so it
[SPEAKER_14]: changed the economic consideration of that
cultivar dramatically it made it to where
[SPEAKER_14]: they could cheapen the price of shipping
so not only was it resistant but it was
[SPEAKER_14]: cheaper to move and then just within the
last year there's another form of fusarium
[SPEAKER_14]: that is attacking the Cavendish cultivar
and so now we're about to see another one
[SPEAKER_14]: of these banana epidemics and that's what
I see within cannabis we see certain
[SPEAKER_14]: populations that are exceptionally prone
we noticed when the fusarium came in we
[SPEAKER_14]: noticed when well PM's been here for a
long time in the back probably 15-18 years
[SPEAKER_14]: and I remember when it first came in and I
can be traced it back in the Oregon roads
[SPEAKER_14]: with the roads reference and you can kind
of see where things moved forward but then
[SPEAKER_14]: the brood mite that came in the bus that
might have followed these these issues are
[SPEAKER_14]: relatively when the speed at which they
move is incredible and so it's the same
[SPEAKER_14]: situation where the only way you're going
to find out resistance on this is if you
[SPEAKER_14]: have it and so we can try to keep
everything as protected as possible all
[SPEAKER_14]: the time in the production end of it but
really there's very little R&D done in
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis where you're actually exposing
these plants to these issues and you test
[SPEAKER_14]: them there is a for me I can do it because
I own a nursery so my nursery is a little
[SPEAKER_14]: different than most nurseries because one
of my location and in English that means
[SPEAKER_14]: that I supply people who produce tunch for
a long time and so we might estimate that
[SPEAKER_14]: the work that the nursery creates might
come out anywhere between 150 to 200
[SPEAKER_14]: million dollars a year in product grown
from the cutting so over the last four
[SPEAKER_14]: years I might be involved in 800 million
dollars in cannabis on the table so I look
[SPEAKER_14]: at it differently I didn't create a
hundred million dollars myself but my
[SPEAKER_14]: nursery stock created approximately that
much value and it's it's a huge
[SPEAKER_14]: responsibility in your mind to understand
how you maintain this type of relationship
[SPEAKER_14]: with the farmers and how do you keep
people solving how do you keep them moving
[SPEAKER_14]: forward and what we see now is basically I
got clones from somebody or I grab
[SPEAKER_14]: something from somebody and no one has any
data on it none and so for us you know in
[SPEAKER_14]: order to make it work in the way I do at
the tonnage ground is that we always
[SPEAKER_14]: typically release a cultivar a year after
selection and so what that does it lets me
[SPEAKER_14]: take a look at a plant and then I can put
it in four major production groupings
[SPEAKER_14]: which is indoor outdoor rehousing like
that and those four different situations
[SPEAKER_14]: have radical different impacts on the
cultivar's performance it's morphological
[SPEAKER_14]: traits it's designability to the market
and so all of this stuff takes time so you
[SPEAKER_14]: have a situation where we're all operating
using stock that we've gathered but once
[SPEAKER_14]: you start to DNA through the beauty of the
galaxy and I have no affiliation with the
[SPEAKER_14]: company so it's not that I'm pushing the
company it's that I use the tool because
[SPEAKER_14]: it lets me get a really clear look of
where the bottom line is and where the
[SPEAKER_14]: diversity is and that way we can start to
say let's let's diversify what we're
[SPEAKER_14]: working with genetically and then in these
things what information we have and how do
[SPEAKER_14]: we start to work with it and what I've
tried to do all these years which just
[SPEAKER_14]: caused some of my friends in the past
unbelievable stress was I was very golden
[SPEAKER_14]: with this I shared the vast majority of
this information or I shared the vast
[SPEAKER_14]: majority of these clones we didn't hold
them proprietary we didn't put it in a
[SPEAKER_14]: situation where only special individuals
got them the lower you were ranked in the
[SPEAKER_14]: canvas kingdom the kinder I was to you
because fundamentally that's what makes up
[SPEAKER_14]: the canvas kingdom it's made up of regular
individuals who are about yes and for me
[SPEAKER_14]: that that's the most important part
because that's the human connection that's
[SPEAKER_14]: what allows us to have a different
industry model that's what allows cannabis
[SPEAKER_14]: to be unique in the way it is it allows us
to actually create an industry based off
[SPEAKER_14]: of our relationship with the plant you see
very little relationship with plants you
[SPEAKER_14]: see relationship with money and I'm not
anti business at all but that shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_14]: the driving force solely for cannabis and
so so much of the stuff that we're trying
[SPEAKER_14]: to understand is is how do we take the
information from very intelligent
[SPEAKER_14]: scientists researchers nursery operators
who work with regulatory process and how
[SPEAKER_14]: do you take that information and how do
you apply it to what you do because that's
[SPEAKER_14]: the applicability that matters if anything
you get out of talking to me is really
[SPEAKER_14]: about how to get the product of the table
everything else is compensation but that's
[SPEAKER_14]: my main direction and I hope to get into
some stuff about how do we do that so
[SPEAKER_14]: thank you very much good
[SPEAKER_05]: morning I just love this I look forward to
this every year so thanks for doing this
[SPEAKER_09]: so we've got about 18 minutes Ray is
running this tight and lunch on time so
[SPEAKER_09]: that we can hear the lunch we've got 18
minutes questions how we're going to run
[SPEAKER_09]: this is Ray and I will split the room and
we'll keep you on deck but we want
[SPEAKER_09]: questions to be very brief no speeches
we're not going to give up the mic to you
[SPEAKER_09]: okay so any questions any questions for
the panel we've got two so we'll start
[SPEAKER_02]: with David and shanko shanko so I guess
there's been growers who've had issues
[SPEAKER_02]: where they're not able to track back where
pesticides are coming from when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: testing positively and lately Oregon and
Washington identify any part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: endemic chemicals like indole 3d and
salicylic acid in pesticides or
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizers and they're not labeling it
especially in cannabis why is this not a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem we see in regular agriculture why
is it condemning with cannabis and is
[SPEAKER_17]: there anything being done to solve it well
I'll speak to a little bit of that but why
[SPEAKER_17]: is this not a problem in the crops yeah
where is it it is the Department of Ag
[SPEAKER_17]: does a limited amount of pesticide testing
on other crops you guys are definitely
[SPEAKER_17]: being targeted right now pesticide testing
to I suppose that's mandated but in other
[SPEAKER_17]: crops we definitely do see that on
occasion and it does make depending on the
[SPEAKER_17]: regulatory structure around that that
problem shipping movement of that profits
[SPEAKER_17]: because we have to destroy it on occasion
so yeah it does happen well because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's changes there's fertilizers that
are adding these chemicals they're
[SPEAKER_02]: fighting and that's why they're not able
to track where they're coming from when
[SPEAKER_02]: they're doing the effect checks they're
buying that Oregon and Washington about
[SPEAKER_02]: pret the ends and products are labels
they've got a friend in indole 3d and
[SPEAKER_02]: salicylic acid and fertilizer label
products illegally and so that's where the
[SPEAKER_02]: I think where the biggest problem is
they're not finding it until now because
[SPEAKER_02]: they look at oh well there's nothing wants
in their fertilizer and fertilizers
[SPEAKER_14]: regulated differently through the I think
that so much of it is money-driven
[SPEAKER_14]: products that are sold at canvas people
that's mind-bending how much more
[SPEAKER_14]: expensive they are I mean when I was I saw
this article years ago it was about the
[SPEAKER_14]: CDD CDD specific bacteria and so I said
that's fascinating I said and how could
[SPEAKER_14]: possibly target CDD by itself so I went
and researched it I found the company that
[SPEAKER_14]: made the product and then I found the real
ag product which was the same product it
[SPEAKER_14]: was five bucks with a container it was a
hundred bucks the canvas related products
[SPEAKER_14]: and so the problem is canvas people can't
sue you really a lot of us are unable to
[SPEAKER_14]: come after you in court we didn't have the
ability to say hey listen you sold me some
[SPEAKER_14]: product that VQ'd on this stuff well you
can now and I think with the
[SPEAKER_14]: accountability you'll have to change it
but it's it's we have to tell people all
[SPEAKER_14]: the time any product you see that's
working that well have that stuff checked
[SPEAKER_14]: because there's nothing that knocks
anything back organically like a chemical
[SPEAKER_14]: it slows the process it doesn't just wipe
it out and so I think that I'm seeing it's
[SPEAKER_14]: moving too well it's too trendy it's too
pricey we just wait and then it comes up
[SPEAKER_17]: on a ban list also as a young industry
you're all here for a reason you can
[SPEAKER_03]: demand better you can do the
accountability that's why you're here you
[SPEAKER_10]: vote with your wallet thank you my
question is you know genetics have been
[SPEAKER_10]: moving around the world for generations
regardless of the regulation from friend
[SPEAKER_10]: to friend now we're all have all this
including you in the room are working
[SPEAKER_10]: together to create strains that are more
pathogen resistant and better yielding but
[SPEAKER_10]: we also are still doing this on an
international level my question for you is
[SPEAKER_10]: what do you see evolving that's allowing
us to evolve these new pathogen pathogen
[SPEAKER_10]: resistant strains beyond the regulations
that for example don't allow us to ship
[SPEAKER_10]: them across state lines we ran into that a
lot of developing the labs I'm sure that
[SPEAKER_10]: we're running into that now working with
agricultural experts all over the world
[SPEAKER_10]: that can't touch each other's spine body
will they be able to share the data would
[SPEAKER_14]: you say Kevin they'd be able to share the
data and so ultimately we were talking
[SPEAKER_14]: about plant breeding at the modern level
it's going to be on marker system and so
[SPEAKER_14]: you'd be able to share that data to other
scientists and say this is what we look
[SPEAKER_14]: for and this is what we search and they'd
be able to search out those cultivars too
[SPEAKER_14]: because ultimately you don't want the same
cultivar in every part of the United
[SPEAKER_14]: States because it's really not meant for
it it's should be the geographical zones
[SPEAKER_14]: so this way you're optimizing the actual
situation there is a vacuum you can do
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever you want no matter where you are
in the world but that's the most expensive
[SPEAKER_14]: form of production and for a lot of
individuals outdoor is pretty accurate in
[SPEAKER_14]: terms of probability but it's going to be
specific for your location and so you can
[SPEAKER_14]: share the information and get the data but
ultimately you're going to have to do
[SPEAKER_14]: another sifting process to get the
cultivar working the dampness of coastal
[SPEAKER_14]: Washington versus the interior dry so even
with other big ag crops where you can ship
[SPEAKER_12]: them wherever you want often goes that way
you know you'll use the knowledge that you
[SPEAKER_12]: get genetic markers to do a localized
breeding program and do it faster because
[SPEAKER_12]: the way you learn in another country I
will say though that in the United States
[SPEAKER_12]: every breeding program has to be in every
market you have to develop plants that are
[SPEAKER_12]: specific to that market and start with
genetic material in that market in the
[SPEAKER_12]: rest the country is becoming a global
industry half a dozen countries have
[SPEAKER_12]: export and import rights now so this sort
of global cultivar development is going to
[SPEAKER_12]: happen and you know the u.s.
[SPEAKER_17]: is going to fall behind and eventually
hopefully there will be access to the
[SPEAKER_17]: national germ class repository system for
canvas where you're actually keeping the
[SPEAKER_17]: genetics in one place and it's open
publicly for three years and researchers
[SPEAKER_01]: to use and we have our next question hi my
question is for Kevin you seem to be
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting the nail on the head with a lot of
the questions and concerns that I have you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a lot of information about strains
that work well outdoor light depth
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and are you connected with
anybody here in Washington where we could
[SPEAKER_01]: get this information and relevant to your
strains or do you share this general
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge about certain strains that are
to help out the growers in Washington you
[SPEAKER_14]: can reach me direct I mean I'm pretty easy
accessible and I'm not even talking about
[SPEAKER_14]: reaching directly by the product I'm just
saying I'm pretty accessible to talk about
[SPEAKER_14]: products you have to share the information
otherwise we're going to collapse as a
[SPEAKER_14]: culture I love canvas so much because it's
all these small individuals have made it
[SPEAKER_14]: up and I'm not against corporations it's
just how America's run but I'm definitely
[SPEAKER_14]: against taking over an industry in the
hands of few and so for me I try to share
[SPEAKER_14]: as much as I can and get as many products
into the market as possible I can't share
[SPEAKER_14]: genetics and other states that's a league
but the information is definitely
[SPEAKER_14]: available so you can check me out see me
after the thing and I'll give you an email
[SPEAKER_14]: and then you can we can chop it up about
what is it that you're trying to do what
[SPEAKER_14]: are you struggling with and then we'll
take a look at what your market is because
[SPEAKER_14]: the market determines where you're going
to put this product and so you can't just
[SPEAKER_14]: grow stuff that you want to grow people
get confused with that you have to grow
[SPEAKER_14]: things that the market wants but the
markets pretty big and you have to be able
[SPEAKER_14]: to take a look at that market and then
from there you neck down what works in
[SPEAKER_14]: your specific and so much of it is trying
to find other farmers around you that have
[SPEAKER_14]: similar geographical situations
environmental conditions cultivation of
[SPEAKER_14]: sameness and then you'll be able to work
in groups I'm lucky in the sense that I
[SPEAKER_14]: get to provide genetics with state of
California which is massive and it lets me
[SPEAKER_14]: work with hundreds of thousands of people
over these years about how to perform for
[SPEAKER_14]: you and those locations and what happened
and was it resistant with their problems
[SPEAKER_14]: and then we can start to take a look and
say hey this cultivar that was selected
[SPEAKER_14]: for this shines here but does not do well
there and it would allow you to get that
[SPEAKER_14]: information so yeah it's all it's all
there and you'll build this situation with
[SPEAKER_14]: your friends too you have to team up you
cannot be a solo producer I love the word
[SPEAKER_14]: proprietary and CEO the two words that I
use it all up use that word in another
[SPEAKER_14]: sentence and I'm like you got it from
somebody down the street and now you're
[SPEAKER_14]: claiming it's yours it's not what you want
to be able to do is work in conjunction
[SPEAKER_14]: and the combined brain power of many
farmers is really driven agricultural
[SPEAKER_14]: forward for millennia and now science is
taking over and it creates a situation
[SPEAKER_14]: where this there's only certain things
that can enter the market because they
[SPEAKER_14]: have engineered resistance but we're not
at that level right now we're still at the
[SPEAKER_14]: level of back to the table and you have to
be able to use conventional farming
[SPEAKER_14]: technology to do it and so to me sharing
the information with your friends making
[SPEAKER_14]: the genetics available everyone thinks
that if I give you this clone it's going
[SPEAKER_14]: to take away my whole world too well if
your market is that small my god you're
[SPEAKER_14]: really in a bubble on itself and so you
have to be able to just you know see it
[SPEAKER_14]: like that be careful who you work with
because otherwise you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_14]: the data back but for someone who's a
farmer who's trying to produce canvas or
[SPEAKER_14]: wants to understand how to use varieties
and these methods you team up there are a
[SPEAKER_14]: lot of collaboration on that I don't see
there's any on the way otherwise combined
[SPEAKER_14]: we are a massive producer there is no
brain there's no brain in Washington or
[SPEAKER_14]: California I had a guy that ran a seven
billion dollar liquor operation and he
[SPEAKER_14]: gave me the lecture on this he was a CEO
of seven billion dollar liquor
[SPEAKER_14]: distributorship and he said Kev he goes
none of you are brand he said in liquor a
[SPEAKER_14]: brand is you can be in 44,000 stores at
once and within 24 hours you can restock
[SPEAKER_14]: all of them he goes none of you guys are
brands you must work collectively to form
[SPEAKER_14]: regional brands and then eventually over
time those things will become large
[SPEAKER_14]: powerhouse commodities but in the intro
you must work together and can this
[SPEAKER_14]: especially where we are like a humble my
god I was like fight those where everybody
[SPEAKER_14]: was a little mini-king running their own
little mini-world and nobody wanted to
[SPEAKER_14]: team up on anything but now that the
money's drained out of the system people
[SPEAKER_14]: are a lot more willing to work together
poverty is good for you it's humbling it
[SPEAKER_14]: makes you want to stand and work together
and you have to be able to team up in that
[SPEAKER_14]: respect and everyone believes they're so
smart and so big and I think all these
[SPEAKER_14]: guys are the giant ag farmers and they're
going to revolutionize the kingdom and
[SPEAKER_14]: they get buried alive because cannabis is
a specialty cultivar and so they have to
[SPEAKER_14]: go through this process to learn and
understand too and so there is no giant
[SPEAKER_14]: advantage right now except in terms of
scope and scale and efficiency of
[SPEAKER_14]: production but in terms of knowledge of
the cultivar how to work with the product
[SPEAKER_14]: and understanding how to work together we
can build that we really have this
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity okay we have our next question
thank you for being here as you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: LCB adopted the pesticide action levels at
whack through 1455 108 this August there
[SPEAKER_00]: are 59 analyzes you know everything else
in the world is subject to a point one
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million threshold I'm wondering
if you feel that that was the correct list
[SPEAKER_00]: of analytes or if the the whack should
undergo amendment in the future well like
[SPEAKER_17]: any good rule it's going to have to be
adapted over time for sure so as far as if
[SPEAKER_17]: that was the right approach or not I know
there's very opinions within our agency
[SPEAKER_17]: about that but it is what we have right
now and it's a start I think that's going
[SPEAKER_17]: to have to be adapted constantly and that
list will be will be changing constantly
[SPEAKER_17]: no doubt but you know just this year our
departments put forward to EPA some
[SPEAKER_17]: federal labeling for four different
products of course those were denied but
[SPEAKER_17]: we are trying to move forward with getting
more products and more tools for growers
[SPEAKER_17]: as far as pesticide okay our next question
is here thank you for all that you do and
[SPEAKER_08]: providing such great leadership in our
state I have two questions from friends
[SPEAKER_08]: one is who couldn't be here from
Benningham wondering if we can get a quick
[SPEAKER_08]: update on what is happening in the in
Washington state and also a question on
[SPEAKER_08]: importing CBD oil from different places
what is happening with that issue thank
[SPEAKER_17]: you I really didn't compare come here
prepared to answer those questions my
[SPEAKER_17]: knowledge is pretty specific to my program
but I will let tell you that Department of
[SPEAKER_17]: Ag is forming a new position for cannabis
coordinator so within the next few months
[SPEAKER_17]: there will be someone you can call with
all those kinds of questions a
[SPEAKER_17]: one-stop-shop sort of person that will
will be able to address all those things I
[SPEAKER_11]: think the reason people have a policy
panel who will have some of those answers
[SPEAKER_07]: okay next question from Shawn hi Shawn
from Washington by the company this is a
[SPEAKER_07]: question for Mowgli because Mowgli four
years ago you guys came through our farm
[SPEAKER_07]: and got some samples and we're on the
galaxy and I think it's just such a cool
[SPEAKER_07]: sight and I noticed that you've changed it
recently and groupings have gotten kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: tighter and you know oftentimes plants
that share some similar genetics so I
[SPEAKER_07]: guess I have two questions what is those
similarities do they also do the
[SPEAKER_07]: similarities and tripping profiles do you
know and the second question is because of
[SPEAKER_07]: these tight groupings and all these goofy
names that we have for thousands of
[SPEAKER_07]: different kind of you know cannabis do you
see in the future us consolidate
[SPEAKER_07]: consolidating you know say the cushions
down to a few names and that you know the
[SPEAKER_12]: different the different groupings yeah so
so the galaxy for those of you haven't
[SPEAKER_12]: seen it's just interactive
three-dimensional map of all the different
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis right and they're just position
in terms of how closely related they are
[SPEAKER_12]: to each other so traditionally related
it's far away and the last version of the
[SPEAKER_12]: galaxy we did we took all the all the
varieties of clones of each other and we
[SPEAKER_12]: collapsed them into these bigger clusters
and if you click on them you can see all
[SPEAKER_12]: the all the cuts that are in there and you
know you see exactly what you would expect
[SPEAKER_12]: that we get you know within one colonial
cluster there's tons of weird names and
[SPEAKER_12]: you can usually tell most of the names are
the same or similar but then there's lots
[SPEAKER_12]: of stuff it's just totally the same and
you'll see stuff you know the same name
[SPEAKER_12]: very far away so it's sort of a catalog of
errors if you're looking at the names but
[SPEAKER_12]: it is evolving towards being cleaner and
more accurate so people are logging in
[SPEAKER_12]: changing the names and they need to and
it's sort of cleaning itself up and as we
[SPEAKER_12]: get more and more data more things are
sort of coalescing into those coal
[SPEAKER_12]: clusters the og cush cluster is
complicated right there's there's a lot
[SPEAKER_12]: like Kevin said it's a lot of og's and so
there's kind of a few different big og
[SPEAKER_12]: clusters and you know the answer to the
question like which one was first that's
[SPEAKER_12]: not really scientific question like that
one of the clusters is bigger than all the
[SPEAKER_12]: other clusters you know but you have to
kind of look at the family relationships
[SPEAKER_12]: and see where they came from and see who
submitted them to figure it out um but
[SPEAKER_12]: thank you by the way for for those samples
so four years ago when we started this
[SPEAKER_12]: whole project I took a drive through
Washington State collecting samples and a
[SPEAKER_12]: lot of the people that I collected those
that first batch of samples from our inner
[SPEAKER_12]: room here and then at two thirty in the
morning I was driving back to Oregon by a
[SPEAKER_12]: car full of fresh leaves and they were
really they really smelled amazing and I
[SPEAKER_12]: got pulled over by a cop and she and this
was I guess Washington had just become
[SPEAKER_12]: legal anyway so she stuck her head in the
car and said sir how much marijuana have
[SPEAKER_12]: you been smoking and I was like I'm a
scientist I swear to God and I actually
[SPEAKER_12]: had to show her like I was like look
there's a centrifuge in the trunk and she
[SPEAKER_12]: walked around to check that she looked at
she gave her and she was like I already
[SPEAKER_12]: see the centrifuge and then I had to show
her all I had to show her like these
[SPEAKER_12]: aren't this isn't even dry meat like these
are just fresh flowers they're in plastic
[SPEAKER_12]: bags they're how would you smoke that you
couldn't even smoke it I just showed her
[SPEAKER_12]: all the samples and I ended up standing
there with her on the side of the road
[SPEAKER_12]: talking about plant genetics for like
almost 25 minutes and then finally she was
[SPEAKER_12]: like alright sir you can go on your way
and I remember thinking I was like is this
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff I asked her I was like is this whole
new world all these new laws is it just
[SPEAKER_12]: wrecking your head you know all this stuff
is legal then and she was like no you know
[SPEAKER_12]: this is Washington State we can roll with
it and also like we don't really care
[SPEAKER_12]: about the way your car smells like we're
gonna look you in the eyes and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_12]: see if you should be on the road or not
and you seem to be driving on our things
[SPEAKER_12]: she let me go so I always felt like
Washington is sort of like a good place
for this whole thing to start
[SPEAKER_14]: I do so much R&D for other companies on
inputs and then I run all the tests
[SPEAKER_14]: afterwards to see these things and so I
just did video on this because it's so
[SPEAKER_14]: fascinating that you couldn't just you
could not tell the human could not tell
[SPEAKER_14]: which sample came out of those two bags
but one of them was very high in alpha and
[SPEAKER_14]: beta-pinene zero canthine and the other
variety was high in canthine no alpha
[SPEAKER_14]: beta-pinene so therefore one of them is
right one of them is not right no they're
[SPEAKER_14]: both right what people believe is that
when you add an input you just increase
[SPEAKER_14]: the turps it's like it's all going to move
linearly it doesn't it's complex and you
[SPEAKER_14]: can have bacteria that converts turps into
other turps you can have all these
[SPEAKER_14]: enzymatic conversions that make smell
appear and so when you're looking at that
[SPEAKER_14]: from that point of view it's moved it's
the people like the way it smells
[SPEAKER_14]: ultimately the big numbers are nice on the
display board at the store but the bottom
[SPEAKER_14]: line is trying to use turps to mark a
variety that's exceptionally inaccurate
[SPEAKER_14]: and we've been trying to do this for a
while like how do we fingerprint it that's
[SPEAKER_14]: where the DNA comes in and then it prints
now you're going to have more logical
[SPEAKER_14]: changes from and subtle shifts in what
things do but on a gene level the same but
[SPEAKER_14]: turps all over the place and you don't
know the difference that's what blew my
[SPEAKER_14]: mind was I'm comparing these these tests
and I'm preparing this R&D and no one in
[SPEAKER_14]: my circle we're all career guys like we
know cannabis pretty well you could not
[SPEAKER_14]: differentiate which one was wrong but one
of them very high in pi-en-o or high in
[SPEAKER_14]: canthine you know they don't smell the
same in terms of camping and vitamins but
[SPEAKER_14]: exact same strain just two different
inputs so you know your farm could what
[SPEAKER_14]: you'll find is that for you you're trying
to find out what creates the most
[SPEAKER_14]: distinctive desirable impact on the
customer and that's working with your
[SPEAKER_14]: inputs and you're going to discover what
you use on your farm drives in the
[SPEAKER_14]: direction you want and that's what you
care about but otherwise what the turpene
[SPEAKER_14]: signature is oh my god it's so variable
there's no word for it and I think it's so
[SPEAKER_14]: complex that people are trying to dumb it
down too much it's too big also so you
[SPEAKER_12]: know so the galaxy right now it's just
genetic data that's all so eventually
[SPEAKER_12]: we're going to pull in term data and stuff
like that you'll be able to see that
[SPEAKER_12]: overlay on it we don't have that yet but
there's no question that genetics is just
[SPEAKER_12]: a piece of the puzzle it's you know it's
the only way to make sense of your data to
[SPEAKER_12]: know what plant you actually have but all
the art comes in after that and so there's
[SPEAKER_12]: a group called the grow-off now they're
taking genetically identified samples and
[SPEAKER_12]: we're sequencing them and they're giving
them to different growers to see who can
[SPEAKER_12]: get the best out of them and people can
take one genetically defined plant and
[SPEAKER_12]: push it in all kinds of directions so we
have this organic cannabis cup in Oregon
[SPEAKER_12]: called cultivation classic and we sequence
all the winners and when we give the
[SPEAKER_12]: prizes away we show them where they are in
the galaxy and I always have to stand up
[SPEAKER_12]: there and say you know this amazing plant
one it's called Guava Ken or whatever I'm
[SPEAKER_12]: sorry I can tell you it's just a green
crack and then last year the outdoor CBD
[SPEAKER_12]: competition was won by this great farm
here in Pueyna for this plant called
[SPEAKER_12]: Corazon and I had to get up and say it's
just ACDC but you know they and if you
[SPEAKER_12]: click on the ACDC cluster now the galaxy
you see there's Corazon they kept the name
[SPEAKER_12]: right because they grew the hell out of
that plant not just one generation but
[SPEAKER_12]: like over several years of having it in
their environment and it's accumulating
[SPEAKER_12]: epigenetic changes and they made it unique
genetically it's just ACDC but they turned
[SPEAKER_12]: it into a coupler so the genetics is just
based on so we have a couple of quotable
[SPEAKER_05]: quotes from this panel already one
remotely state patrol officer we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: care what your car smells like and Kevin
cannabis is complicated which is very true
[SPEAKER_15]: our next question so about six months ago
I read an article of Mowgli and Kevin
[SPEAKER_15]: quoted in it and the basic gist of it was
like the big bad money is here and they
[SPEAKER_15]: are patenting our genetics and we're not
going to be able to grow the strength
[SPEAKER_15]: we've known and loved for decades right so
my question is where are we what's the
[SPEAKER_15]: solution to that problem and is that
compounding and getting worse or is there
[SPEAKER_15]: a lunar of light and hope yes
[SPEAKER_12]: so all that stuff is happening there's a
cleaner of hope I think the open canvas
[SPEAKER_12]: project and making data public about the
plants that are out there now is the only
[SPEAKER_12]: smart thing that we've come up with to do
about it the open canvas project has
[SPEAKER_12]: recently plugged into the the open source
software community who've been through the
[SPEAKER_12]: Pat wars for 20 years and they have a lot
of wisdom about how to keep things out of
[SPEAKER_12]: that world and how to fight back against
that system and so there's a lot that can
[SPEAKER_12]: be done but yeah we should be able to stop
them from restricting anything that is out
[SPEAKER_12]: there now if we do things right it will be
very hard to stop them from restricting
[SPEAKER_04]: futures question hi my name is Kurt from
my curious crow I had a question about
[SPEAKER_04]: russet mites and we just started noticing
russet mites probably about two years ago
[SPEAKER_04]: and we've heard all sorts of different
stories that you know initially the
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Transportation had released
them on the side of the road to kill weeds
[SPEAKER_04]: and they spread marijuana but all I know
is they're extremely pesky little bastards
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're difficult to get rid of and
you know I went full organic last year and
[SPEAKER_04]: it was almost impossible for me to get rid
of them completely better for insects and
[SPEAKER_04]: so what do you have any suggestions for
that you know I know a lot of it has to do
[SPEAKER_04]: with you know I'm in a space where there
are multiple guards around me and so if
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing you know organic pest management
and my neighbors not doing anything it's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be impossible for me to take care
of my best but I was just wondering if you
[SPEAKER_04]: have any suggestions to to help with
russet mites yeah well if you talk to any
[SPEAKER_17]: other agricultural commodity group they'll
tell you mites are the definite peskiest
[SPEAKER_17]: pest of all pests and so you're an outdoor
grower so you know the first thing would
[SPEAKER_17]: be making sure that you keep dust down
around your facility on the road thru your
[SPEAKER_17]: facility because dust is how it might
spread particularly in orchards and
[SPEAKER_17]: vineyards and such and sanitation is going
to be your best friend because if you can
[SPEAKER_17]: after you've cleaned out a crop you can go
through and steam everything because those
[SPEAKER_17]: guys will be in every crack eggs will be
everywhere and you won't be able to see
[SPEAKER_17]: them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do they vibrate over the winter?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think so I don't know they do they do
apply them they do apply them I was asked
[SPEAKER_14]: that by a reporter and I had them talk to
the county they use them for stark thistle
[SPEAKER_14]: and invasive control they pioneered that
in Canada so in Homo county they probably
[SPEAKER_14]: wiped out I don't know a billion dollars
worth of cannabis they're spraying this
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff continuously and so you can clean
your crop as much as you want but it's
[SPEAKER_14]: going to come back and what we found was
cultivar selection on things that have a
[SPEAKER_14]: higher resistance and then you work with
your beneficial insects company to work on
[SPEAKER_14]: a strategy of juvenile adults at a
predation rate that's going to out compete
[SPEAKER_14]: it and so I had them blow over the hill
and land on a pharmacy or my own farm and
[SPEAKER_14]: we saw some higher bugs present so let us
know that there was some food which means
[SPEAKER_14]: they were eating something and so once we
started to find the silicone nodules on
[SPEAKER_14]: the bottom of those leaves we were like
here they go and it was too late to use
[SPEAKER_14]: sulfur.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sulfur works really well for this it's
cheap.
[SPEAKER_14]: Entomatics are tough because they bleach
the leaf a lot so enzymes are tough and
[SPEAKER_14]: entomatics really live a culture on the
plant which then disqualifies you from
[SPEAKER_14]: selling the product so depending on what
point in time you're going to use some of
[SPEAKER_14]: these tools so sulfur and nephron flower
is going to be an effective product and
[SPEAKER_14]: enzymatics nephron flower is going to be
an effective product in terms of both but
[SPEAKER_14]: the beneficial insects work it's just that
people don't do it at the level you need
[SPEAKER_14]: to I'm talking you got to get on every one
of those plants and you need juveniles and
[SPEAKER_14]: adults so that the adults come out and go
right to work and then the juveniles
[SPEAKER_14]: colonize and work basically I was running
three times the normal level of predation
[SPEAKER_14]: that was required but I salvaged that crop
I probably lost you know maybe five to ten
[SPEAKER_14]: percent of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: My friends lost ninety five percent of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I know for the well inside I had the
persimilis but that was for two spotted
[SPEAKER_04]: spider mites and then outside they were
the sachets I don't remember what the
[SPEAKER_04]: insect was but it's sachets there they
last for three to four weeks there they
[SPEAKER_04]: hatch inside the sachets and they're
released slowly over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are your juveniles.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the adults get the adults because they
come three star so as soon as you open the
[SPEAKER_14]: adults in a sachet tube it's more like a
little lunch box filled with vermiculite
[SPEAKER_14]: and when you open that little bucket you
run them for food.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then talk to the family and make sure
they know you've got an impact on your
[SPEAKER_17]: crop.
[SPEAKER_12]: So can I ask the rest of the panel a
question about russet mites?
[SPEAKER_12]: With a lot of pest resistance traits,
crops will have a wide range of inherent
[SPEAKER_12]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_12]: For russet mites, do we know crops that
have significant genetic resistance
[SPEAKER_12]: determinants?
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what do you think about the
candidates?
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you see plants that have inherent
levels of russet mite resistance that are
[SPEAKER_12]: significantly different than others?
[SPEAKER_14]: I do and I almost think it's due to I want
to say tough epidural layer.
[SPEAKER_14]: You see plants that have like rhino skin
they seem to do better because when I I'm
[SPEAKER_14]: doing tests and I have a tremendous number
of cultivars at the test site certain ones
[SPEAKER_14]: get into that and certain ones don't at
different levels of infestation.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the problem is that the stuff that's
resistant.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're selecting for that epidural layer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah at least I know that what I can say
is hey we've had very good success with
[SPEAKER_14]: this use this as a portion of your crop
because you don't want to be so
[SPEAKER_14]: monoculture that way either because now
you're prone to some other pathogenic
[SPEAKER_14]: problems.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have to kind of figure out what's
your distribution based off of market
[SPEAKER_14]: velocity and survival ability and you'll
be able to kind of get yourself into a
[SPEAKER_14]: situation that requires a tremendous
amount of preemptive work.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to be on it before it ever
happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Discipline environmental cultural
controls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay next question.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi my question is about regulatory
policies and the role and integration of
[SPEAKER_16]: departments of agriculture into them.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm from Montana.
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate you early adopting states
because we can look at what you do in
[SPEAKER_16]: steel mechanisms but also we don't have to
do some things that you maybe had to do
[SPEAKER_16]: for political reasons.
[SPEAKER_16]: And looking at the model of the cannabis
and winter control board you know of
[SPEAKER_16]: course we look at that and understand the
political advantage of aligning cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: with something people understand that
being alcohol.
[SPEAKER_16]: However we're looking since we're not on
the forefront of to what extent we
[SPEAKER_16]: actually meet with the department.
[SPEAKER_16]: Of agriculture because we're medical we're
in the Department of Health and Human
[SPEAKER_16]: Services but as we move towards adult use
we are actually trying to lean in the
[SPEAKER_16]: direction of ACT being the leading state
agency.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was wondering if you had any
comments about that and also whether or
[SPEAKER_16]: not that was brought into the Washington
conversation after the regulatory
[SPEAKER_16]: mechanism of the board was established or
after.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure there's people in the room who
can answer that better than I as far as
[SPEAKER_17]: the chronology of that but yes I think
that having a lead organization in
[SPEAKER_17]: agriculture has some definite benefits.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think if we were going back and doing it
again we would give LCB, Ag, Health,
[SPEAKER_17]: some authorities and the original package
didn't have any authorities.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah it's going to take a team working
together.
[SPEAKER_17]: You need to give everybody a piece of that
pie.
[SPEAKER_17]: So now we have to catch up a little bit
with our system.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you know getting ag involved is key of
course.
[SPEAKER_17]: Control is one thing you know controlled
substance and all that but the agriculture
[SPEAKER_17]: piece is so key is so important.
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope that you can build that into your
original legislation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That will be our final question for this
panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a request to have a picture of
the panel and remember that there are
[SPEAKER_05]: handouts as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those who wish to take that picture
please do so right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many watched CNN?
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know why you're giggling.
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who did not, CNN put
correspondents in various cities around
[SPEAKER_05]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have one in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they first went to the correspondents
she was standing there.
[SPEAKER_05]: She doesn't look good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Standing there talking about what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as she went on air the three
people behind her all next to her.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was an instant cloud.
[SPEAKER_05]: They went to various locations and another
time they went over to her and she was
[SPEAKER_05]: standing there holding a cast mass ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody handed her a joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: She didn't invite them during that and
said she could.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was giggling a lot more by the end of
the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bring this up because the entire
time they were showing her I was thinking
[SPEAKER_05]: how long will it be before that shit says
something if he's watching this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took about 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry to miss it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really quite funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a picture taken.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's release this panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
