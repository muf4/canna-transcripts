[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's just fine in the greenhouseâ€¦
until it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis plant is highly adaptive,
but she also tells you right away if
[SPEAKER_00]: growing conditions are slipping and she's
not feeling so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to read the condition of the
plants and then correlate that to what is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the growing environment takes
some serious experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professional growers are finely tuned to
sense the changes in the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment so they can adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, though, you can find yourself
in a bad way.
[SPEAKER_00]: In times like these, you better have some
rescue skills.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Eric Branstad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric is a longtime cultivator and has
become one of, if not the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: voice in cannabis greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may remember Eric Branstad from
Shaping Fire episode 13 when he was here
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about greenhouses and light dep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric is the recent founder of Greenhouse
Advisory Group after spending over a
[SPEAKER_00]: decade with Forever Flowering Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are, if you've attended a cannabis
convention in the last five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've seen Eric speak about light dep.
[SPEAKER_00]: During episode 13, we focused on the
pre-planning and building of your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we're gonna talk about
what to do when greenhouses go bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're talking about greenhouse
rescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Shango, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to have you back,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I always get such great feedback
whenever we do an interview, and I always
[SPEAKER_00]: learn a lot too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let's set a context for people
who are not really familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses yet and bring them up to speed
before we get into the nitty gritty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the attributes of a greenhouse
that attracts so much people to growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, originally when it was people
growing cannabis in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was to protect from the rains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor plants would get rained on right
before harvest and would actually disrupt
[SPEAKER_01]: that harvest in the sense that it might,
you know, contaminate the flowers or do
[SPEAKER_01]: something to create mold and these
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the greenhouse was like the shelter to
help ensure a successful harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also a lot of people that
now look to cost of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at a legal business in
cannabis, you know, the cost of production
[SPEAKER_01]: is really important these days because
your cost of production dictates almost if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna make any profit or not,
it's easy to spend a lot of money to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all figured that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the art now is to see how
cheap we can grow it, not to grow it cheap
[SPEAKER_01]: and crappy, but I just mean, how can we
grow it to not spend a ton of money on
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, soil, and all the other things
that generally were the norm?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, a lot of people look to
the greenhouse as an indoor grow room with
[SPEAKER_01]: the free sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not the best way to look at it,
even though that's kind of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: common sense, I guess, thought to say,
oh, a greenhouse, I could get rid of my
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity bill or the lighting bill,
at least, and we can use the sun and let's
[SPEAKER_01]: go get a greenhouse type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you've primarily come from
indoor growing, there's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a stumbling block, I think,
than people that have been accustomed to
[SPEAKER_01]: growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, for the most part,
a greenhouse also outfits or has the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to do the light deprivation
technique, which creates a photo period so
[SPEAKER_01]: people can get multiple harvests using the
sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more advantages to using a
greenhouse in cannabis nowadays more than
[SPEAKER_01]: ever compared to the way it used to be,
but you have to understand the method to
[SPEAKER_01]: the madness or else your cost of
production is gonna go through the roof or
[SPEAKER_01]: you might not even, you know, the failure
rate's really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm actually really looking forward to
going through that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you and I talked to set up this
interview, the list of issues that come up
[SPEAKER_00]: when people are inappropriately using
their greenhouse is really long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it might as well be
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be fun to go through these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we understand why greenhouses are
useful, but let's also give people an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of how much these things cost,
because I know that there's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: continuum of costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you give people a general idea of
what a company might spend on a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and just roughly what they're gonna get
for that kind of money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's, you know, I like to look at
greenhouses in three different categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the hoop houses, the traditional,
you know, round arch or hoop house for the
[SPEAKER_01]: lack of better words.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can be fairly affordable from one
greenhouse company to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more of the entry level season
extender type of greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they also can be in different sizes
of metal for the most part or thicknesses,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for the most part, hoop houses are the
affordable ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be a couple of dollars a square
foot for the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the Gothic shape frames,
which usually are a little beefier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a little bit more of a point to
the, to the roof than a hoop house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they generally can handle a little bit
more snow that a lot of times built with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit thicker or bigger metal than a
traditional hoop house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can start to jump up into the 19
to $25 dollars a square foot, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: how big or small you get and how you
outfit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we get into the A frame
category, that's the more commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: looking greenhouses that we see that are
gutter connected and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: really taller and bigger and wow,
you know, like the impressive greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you could say in the commercial
space and the A frame greenhouses
[SPEAKER_01]: typically handle the most snow loads and
wind loads and, and have more features and
[SPEAKER_01]: abilities than the hoop or the Gothic in
most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those start anywhere from 25 to $35
a square foot for those greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what you outfit them with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be, you know, the,
the, the different, uh, benching systems
[SPEAKER_01]: from automated irrigation, heating,
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost of the greenhouse can,
the price per square foot starts to go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more bells and whistles you add to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the A frame really gives you the most
options for those bells and whistles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that you have seen some jaw
dropping stuff in the last year because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you've been doing this for a
long time, 10 plus years, and you've seen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of kind of, you know,
you know, ghetto humble, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses that are going to get blown
away and then people getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: professional and then getting multiple
professional greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the venture capital coming in and
people really throwing their money around,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to solve solutions with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've seen some really
incredibly tricked out greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been pretty fortunate in that
regard and I'm feeling more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: fortunate all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, now that I'm doing my own thing,
I'm actually invited to a lot more places
[SPEAKER_01]: that I hadn't been previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that has also given me the
opportunity, you know, honestly,
[SPEAKER_01]: to see some greenhouses that I've wanted
to see for a long time, but because I was
[SPEAKER_01]: on a different team, so to speak,
it wasn't really something that was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm actually able to see a lot of
these things that I've been really wanting
[SPEAKER_01]: to see because I knew that they were,
you know, new designs, different,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, techniques and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me to really be able to advise
and do the things that I'm doing now,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to be able to see all of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really being proactive to get out
there and get into more places that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been eyeballing for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went to one recently in Southern
California and it was definitely a state
[SPEAKER_01]: of the art, impressive, impressive
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might as well go ahead and plug
Greenhouse Advisory Group right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: because anybody who's followed you knows
that you've been in the greenhouse scene
[SPEAKER_00]: for over a decade, but now you're newly
independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you still have all of the,
you know, more than a decade of experience
[SPEAKER_00]: and know-how, plus being, you know,
OG NorCal guy and have mad connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you formed Greenhouse Advisory Group
and you're working with everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: all comers, all kinds of, you know,
builders and designers and customer side
[SPEAKER_00]: and anybody who wants to leverage your
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I pretty much have the idea right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to pull everybody together that
I can to get people what they need as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as access.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of people are going to one
manufacturer or one consultant and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: getting one view, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good to get a big perspective and
do the due diligence to get a few views,
[SPEAKER_01]: bids and scenarios in order to really wrap
your head around what's going to work or
[SPEAKER_01]: not for that area, for that particular
customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people also, you know,
even though a lot of the companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: help outfit these greenhouses,
you know, with the fans and filtration
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, odor controls and things like
that, people also want to talk to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the main person from those
companies, even though, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one greenhouse company or certain,
these companies don't sell direct,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they all typically try to do it
through one greenhouse company or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That leaves the customer, you know,
only dealing with the sales rep from the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just get, you know, that
information however it's interpreted or
[SPEAKER_01]: relayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really think it's good to actually
connect a lot of the dots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody has, you know, serious odor
control questions, let's talk to the odor
[SPEAKER_01]: control guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to necessarily hear it from
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way it's, you're kind of making
an all-star team of the top people for
[SPEAKER_00]: their particular areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a connection with all these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like I'm employing all these
people and whatnot, but they all are part
[SPEAKER_01]: of this team.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we all want to be together on,
you know, them as much as me to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: customers the access they need to the
information so that they can make good
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions so that they can vet the
consultants and the people that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
you know, like you said, the venture
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalists and people are coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so who's designing these greenhouses
and what are they basing it off of?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of farms in particular I
won't name any names, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I see their greenhouses and their
beautiful state-of-the-art and they've had
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of problems in them and then they're
going to build new greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so where do they get the, you know,
base metric for saying, okay, let's do
[SPEAKER_01]: this new design if they have a
state-of-the-art facility that's not even
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, I mean, is it really that
facility or is it the growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is designing a new state-of-the-art
facility going to make it easier?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm just dying to get into some of
these places and ask some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: questions because I feel like it's just
going on one person's idea after the
[SPEAKER_01]: other, and it's not necessarily prove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where your whole idea that you
mentioned to me at NCIA of greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: rescue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've hired a company and they've
built you a box and they don't really know
[SPEAKER_00]: how the greenhouse works properly for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're rolling in with your
experience and going, no, no, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so let's, let's start before we go
into our first commercial break in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into a little more meat for
the people who have got greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I made a list of a whole bunch of
issues that can come up with your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's start going through those and,
and start knocking them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the one thing, the one problem
that I think most anybody in the national
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis scene has heard you speak on is
heat because oh my gosh, you rail on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I'm going to, I'm going to hand you
the mic and why don't you start talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about heat issues in greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I got a DM last night that asked
me to come out and talk about how they can
[SPEAKER_01]: make their greenhouse cooler or cool
things down because they have too much
[SPEAKER_01]: heat associated with their greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes sense because, you know,
greenhouses were made for trapping air so
[SPEAKER_01]: that that air will heat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, greenhouses were invented for
winter time, not for summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's what I say all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of people want to take this
contraption and throw it out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hottest, sunniest place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't necessarily make sense when
you think about it from the angle of,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, greenhouses were invented for winter
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you trap air, it heats up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thought is in my mind isn't,
okay, let's go to desert hot springs and
[SPEAKER_01]: set up or death Valley and set up a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, even though people are
doing it and you can do it, don't get me
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you don't have those thoughts in your
mind, you go to a greenhouse company or
[SPEAKER_01]: you design a greenhouse yourself without
those thoughts in your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easy to create something that's
not going to function right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's going to create more of a hostile
environment than what you're already
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the greenhouse rescue is a hot
topic right now because we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are coming into it,
imagining what they think they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what they end up having is
heat issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the time, it's always heat because
we're trapping air and it heats up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that happens is the
clearer the cover, the more intense the
[SPEAKER_01]: sun is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have leaf surface temperatures
that go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always just air temperature that
increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the obvious one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the surface temps increase the metal,
the ground, the soil, the grow bags or the
[SPEAKER_01]: containers, and then the leaves
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when plants heat up, they have to
sweat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we get sweaty plants,
that results in condensation and
[SPEAKER_01]: condensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What everybody is what everybody's fearful
of and definitely doesn't want to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and then we go into, OK, how do we
dehumidify?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we, you know, mop up this
condensation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thought isn't back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's figure out how to stop the plants
from sweating.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, and a lot of times the other
default is, OK, put in a cooling system,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, an HVAC or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when we start plugging in a
ton of things, we're taking the green out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking about our cost of
production earlier, needing to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can easily take a greenhouse and
start to plug all this stuff in,
[SPEAKER_01]: run all this equipment and watch our power
bills start to go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go, oh, did this really save
us any money in the long run, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: with the increased hostility and failure
rate that's happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we start to see the russet mites
and the powdery mildews and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, botrytis and all these,
you know, even spider mites in the basic
[SPEAKER_01]: form start to take over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have people that are not growing
cannabis as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say they're waging war.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're out there spraying,
you know, this, I spray that and I spray
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people even say I'm in the battle
of my life right now to get these root
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids knocked back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the, you know, huge battle,
you know, and it's just like, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere you go, we're going to this war
zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not as fun as it used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: People lose their passion really easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get complacent and do, you know,
stupid things, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's, let's, let's roll it all the
way back since the beginning of that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: train of thought is the heat, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the heat can cause this one problem
and then another and another, and they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they chain all the way down until you're
giving up hope and you've lost morale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started out by saying that,
you know, the, the, the, the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: was meant to keep the heat in and it gets
too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it as simple as opening the windows and
are all greenhouses made with opening
[SPEAKER_00]: windows?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of people right now
actually, and that's a good point or topic
[SPEAKER_01]: in the sense that there's a couple of ways
to run a greenhouse for ventilation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the passive ventilation,
which means opening up side vents and roof
[SPEAKER_01]: vents and doors even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's mechanical ventilation,
which means the greenhouse is virtually
[SPEAKER_01]: sealed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only entry point for air is at the
intakes at one end of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the air travels through the
greenhouse and out the exhaust fans the
[SPEAKER_01]: other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, when you're designing a
greenhouse, people often not, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: forget or just don't bother with the
passive ventilation and just do strictly
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanical ventilation because there's
this idea to have this controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I open up these openings, bugs are
going to come in and, and with mechanical
[SPEAKER_01]: ventilation, you're still exchanging a ton
of air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the outside air is coming in
through the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people forget the fact
that, you know, opening the roof or the
[SPEAKER_01]: sidewall may be different than turning on
the fan, but we're still accessing air
[SPEAKER_01]: from the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, so it's not much
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, when you design a greenhouse,
I like to say design it for flexibility
[SPEAKER_01]: and it may cost more, but having passive
and mechanical ventilation is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, opening up the greenhouse alone
isn't enough because greenhouse covers
[SPEAKER_01]: will magnify the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't just, you know, transmit the
light exactly how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually will magnify the light and
create more intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you end up happening is that you
can have a passively ventilated greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: and still have a high leaf surface
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and as example of that is that I was
in Santa Barbara County where it's near
[SPEAKER_01]: the coast, pretty temperate climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was in a big 50,000 square foot
wooden greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't fancy state of the art.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a fairly clear film on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're frosted films.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, so they don't completely clear like
glass, but they're still transmit quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was 75 degrees inside the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the air temperature was fine,
but with using my infrared thermometer,
[SPEAKER_01]: I shot the leaf surface of these plants
that were, you know, probably teens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were small plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a nursery and the leaf surface
temperature was already 94 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a pretty big swing from
having an 80, a 75 degree air temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: to a 94 degree leaf surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know at that point, the plants are
heating up and they're needing to
[SPEAKER_01]: transpire or sweat to keep themselves
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using that water, not for
photosynthetic availability, but for
[SPEAKER_01]: survival at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so of course the greenhouse is feeling
more humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're wanting to pull shade
cloth to try to calm down the sun's
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not just air temperature that
will air temperature is what everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to fight or battle or deal with to
mitigate all these surface temps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can actually, or we, the stuff that I've
done over the course of my history of
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses is using actually a diffused
greenhouse cover that spreads the light
[SPEAKER_01]: uniformly and scatters infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually helps lower the leaf
surface temperature, almost like if you
[SPEAKER_01]: were using shade cloth, but shade cloth
restricts the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to get as much light as
possible to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always super important for cannabis
growers is to get more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they don't want any shade
shadowing or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to get more light, the obvious
thing is to try to get clear materials,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they put out a shade cloth to
restrict the light when it gets too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's kind of this chasing
the tail syndrome that I see going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by using a properly diffused
greenhouse cover, we usually don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: use shade cloth because the diffused cover
actually mimics or acts almost like a
[SPEAKER_01]: shade cloth would in the sense that it is
diffusing the light, but in a sense it's
[SPEAKER_01]: creating more light particles rather than
restricting them because of the diffusion
[SPEAKER_01]: properties in that greenhouse cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I found over the course of
time that it's much easier to support the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and cool them down with the process
of using diffused covers, passive
[SPEAKER_01]: ventilation, circulation fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually get the plant temperature down
rather than the air temperature because at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the day, using certain
equipment, wet walls and things like that
[SPEAKER_01]: to cool a greenhouse to actually get it
down to that temperature doesn't always
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air conditioning or wet wall cooling
systems in greenhouses, sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on where you are in the
humidity, the relative humidity outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't get a temperature drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do, sometimes it's only 10
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's a hundred degree day,
getting it down to 90 degrees in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse doesn't really help anybody
that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's terribly humid inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, I remember back in 2015 or so,
you got your hands on one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared temperature gauges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was funny as hell, man,
because like, I remember watching you in
[SPEAKER_00]: social media, you're like live streaming
this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you're just walking around
greenhouses and you're just like pointing
[SPEAKER_00]: at stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was funny because those of us who
were watching our minds were being blown
[SPEAKER_00]: at seeing, for example, Hey, this room is
75.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, look, this, you know, this,
this piece of metal or whatever is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you know, 102 or something and
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's these huge swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and those of us who are
watching, we're watching you blow your own
[SPEAKER_00]: mind while you were blowing our minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that on forward,
you are all about the, the diffuser film.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so will the diffuser film solve the
problem with the overheating flat
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a greenhouse, just like it does solve
the problem on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the leaf actually does the most of
the plant because it's made of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pulling water from its roots up
through its system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a radiator almost, you know,
plants are, you know, like we pump blood
[SPEAKER_01]: through our veins and our system,
water is pumping through those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the way I like to look at it is
it's easier to cool the plants than it is
[SPEAKER_01]: to cool the air, to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the surfaces actually aren't as
easy to cool like the plants are because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not made of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens is, is people use the
wrong colors in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the other thing I learned with that
infrared thermometer or the laser shooter
[SPEAKER_01]: deal is that, you know, black surfaces and
darker surfaces will heat up more than
[SPEAKER_01]: lighter colored surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really easy to go to the
gardening store and grab some ground cover
[SPEAKER_01]: that's on the shelves at Home Depot or,
you know, wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's usually black, a weed block.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the containers that we grow
in, you know, historically have always
[SPEAKER_01]: been black.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that now we're into the new era
with the, the, the reusable grow bags and
[SPEAKER_01]: the soft containers, you know,
things, the fabric pots and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're making those in tan colors
and white colors because what I found out
[SPEAKER_01]: over the course of time is that black
stores energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't just generate it or attract it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually will store it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what, what that means is when it
gets cool at nighttime, you can touch the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground cover or the grow bags and you can
still feel the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's not a good thing when we're,
you know, using those containers out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the hot sun, whether we're outdoor or in a
greenhouse, that surface is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: greatly increase compared to tan or white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so same with the ground cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a lot of people using the white
ground cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that,
you know, I was, it was really important
[SPEAKER_01]: to me to find white ground cover because
the black just wasn't an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I tried to coin two
different modes though.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's winter mode and summer mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those of you that are using greenhouses
in the winter time, and you should be,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, yet you can switch to the darker
colors to encourage more free heat in the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not going to make a lot and
it's not going to save the garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I always say, every degree
counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can create another degree or two
for free or easy, or we can decrease
[SPEAKER_01]: another degree or two, um, for free by
using these colors in conjunction with the
[SPEAKER_01]: right season, then we're actually trying
to do our best in practices and support of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, because again, everybody's in a lot of
cases battling bugs and battling things,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also the battle for this heat,
you know, battling the heat is another,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's just war out there
sometimes when you look at what people,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it doesn't have to be that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are simple methods that work
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've, you know, tried it and tested it
over the course of many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, I see a lot of benefit in
people using these things and you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: not just a diffused poly woven films or
poly woven plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get diffused poly carbonates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get diffused glass now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not, you know, it's not that you
can't, you got to get the cheap stuff or
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to get the films and somebody
goes, why use the rigid poly carbonates?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wouldn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a diffused, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to go around and talk to the
right people and understand the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, most greenhouse companies for
the most part didn't get into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been a greenhouse company for
already a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of their knowledge and
information and their, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: their business is set around creating a
greenhouse that's optimal for winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have cannabis growers that
show up and go, well, I'm going to use it
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go, oh, well, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, use a wet wall or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those don't work everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I find interesting
is how, you know, you mentioned your
[SPEAKER_00]: summer mode and your winter mode that you
coined and that, you know, some folks when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're thinking about keeping prices or
costs down, they don't like the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: swapping out their ground cover from black
to white or swapping out their fabric
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, well, that's just
wasting money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is though, it's not like the old
days when people would have four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: grow locations and two or three would get
busted, leaving you with two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you had to make everything
severable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nowadays we're talking about
legal grows that are scaled for commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that difference of one or two degrees
could be a huge difference depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you live somewhere that's hot
as hell and you're trying to bring down
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature, those two degrees,
well, you're going to spend way more on
[SPEAKER_00]: air conditioning than you're going to pay
on swapping out some of these seasonal
[SPEAKER_00]: parts, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing, the difference,
if you're trying to increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature in a cool area, well,
switching everything to black is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people are still getting used
to the ideas that at scale, even a degree
[SPEAKER_00]: or two is worth a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, people are starting to wrap that
around their minds right now, because you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, whatever we can do in some cases,
let's say for free, you know, if you
[SPEAKER_01]: already have the containers and the two
things, you're just swapping them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people are already used to
historically buying new stuff every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people throw away their depth
tarps and get a new one, throw out their
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, get new soil, like all these things
are kind of over with.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are trying to figure out how to
save their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are, you know, making use of,
you know, refurbishing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean, you know, just the craft
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people all the way up to the acre,
couple acre greenhouses that are in these
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Barbara County, Monterey County,
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, we need to make do with what we
got and make it work and try to make,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a business out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the other things I see in
the greenhouse rescue side of it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is people spending way too much money
fixing something up that they could have
[SPEAKER_01]: just gone in and planted and made a couple
rounds out of it and then use some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: money to, to fix things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally improve their prove that
their systems are working before they go
[SPEAKER_00]: spend even more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you don't have to have a
state of the art facility to grow some
[SPEAKER_01]: some dank cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to go grow it really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even if you have a dilapidated
piece of shit, wooden greenhouse from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cut flower era in Santa Barbara or
carpenter or in Monterey County,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I see a lot of people go way over
and above fixing these things up where if
[SPEAKER_01]: it was me, I'd put in some hoops with the,
you know, with the roofs caving in and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything and just pull some tarps like,
you know, basically old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go fix all these things up
and spend so much countless money and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no, I don't know where people get
their, their metric for saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, this is what we got to do or we got
to fix it up to this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they just go until they run out of
money and then they have to pack it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: another company moves into that same space
and they try a shot at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times these people don't grow
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep fixing and fixing and fixing
until they run out of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, I do the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be growing, growing, growing,
and then fix shit up later.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you're making money as you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, um, so after the break,
we're going to go ahead and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: some more issues like pests and mold,
but I wanted to get heat out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's like clearly the big gorilla
in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go ahead and take our
first short short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is cannabis greenhouse
expert, Eric Branstad from greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: advisory group, living soil and
regenerative cannabis agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are surging in popularity and to implement
these biological solutions, real science
[SPEAKER_00]: education is vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in all things
probiotic growing, you will probably want
[SPEAKER_00]: to attend the upcoming science of organic
regenerative cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joshua Rutherford of Dutch blooms has
lined up an incredible array of educators
[SPEAKER_00]: for the traveling event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The teaching staff includes Leighton
Morrison and Elaine Ingham on soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Trump talking Korean natural
farming, Kevin Jodry on cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelly and Josh from dragon fly earth
medicine, Suzanne Wainwright, the bug
[SPEAKER_00]: lady, Dr. Robert Faust on natural
bio-stimulants, Steven Reisner on
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics and Chip Osborne on soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more folks will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a grower panel, a breeding
panel, and a Dem certified farmers panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joshua has even built in significant
informal time for you with the teachers as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The teaching staff is just as excited to
work with you as you are about attending
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's no advertising at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: No vendor booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your tuition is what is paying the staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will all be very present and
attentive to you, not a corporate sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even better, the conference is not just
for folks on the west coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt California is hosting one event
for sure, but the show is going on the
[SPEAKER_00]: road to Vancouver, British Columbia,
Portland, Maine, and Ann Arbor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out your pen now because I'm about to
give you the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fabulous opportunity for you to
hear from an array of nationally
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized top shelf soil educators all in
one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, this isn't just beginner
stuff like you get at most conventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an intensive for people like us
who totally nerd out on the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is regenerativeorganiccannabis
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's regenerativeorganiccannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also find a link on the Shaping
Fire Instagram and newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut through all the misinformation out
there and don't miss this opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn real soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a listener of Shaping Fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: by outcompeting potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy mammoth pea near you, check out
[SPEAKER_00]: their website at www.mammothmicrobes.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partner with microorganisms to create
beautiful, thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is cannabis
greenhouse expert, Eric Branstad from
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse Advisory Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eric, during the first set,
we hit heat really hard because there is
[SPEAKER_00]: no doubt that seems to be the gorilla in
the room that everybody's dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that you talk a lot with your
clients about pests, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you talked about during the
first set, you know, if you want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: some passive ventilation and open the damn
windows, a lot of people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, we don't want to do that because we
need to have a closed sterile environment
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't want to attract pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we've got the opposite problem where
if you already have, say, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: a two spot spider mite in the greenhouse
and the temperatures go up, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly now you've created this awesome
breeding ground for the little bastards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when it comes to pests,
what kind of advice do you give your
[SPEAKER_00]: clients on how best to manage and even
maybe design build their greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually have been working on in the
last month on this pretty heavily,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with myself and a couple other
people because I'm bouncing some ideas off
[SPEAKER_01]: of them to get where I'm trying to go with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, yeah, in a nutshell,
everybody comes across pests or deals with
[SPEAKER_01]: pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are getting, you know,
pests or spider mites at minimum from the
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery that they get their clones from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when we talk about sealed
environments versus passive and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, I've been to many, many sealed,
secure, tight ship indoor rooms that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: take any air from outside unless it's
filtered and all these crazy things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they deal with pests, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, pests can get wherever they
want to go in the long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I look at it is that pests are
looking for invitations to a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not just flying by going,
oh, this is green and I'm going to land
[SPEAKER_01]: here and this is the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm a setup shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're asked to actually be conditions
that host that specific bug or pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, yeah, molds can be
flying around in the room and or in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air or in the world for that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't necessarily just go get on
a cannabis plant because it's cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: it happens to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit more detailed than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two things that we got to pay
attention to are the environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why I say, too, there's two
environments to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the environment up above,
which is the the air and the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we talked about the temperature and
humidity and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also the environment
underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that's not necessarily
my specialty, but I have been working more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more with soil people because I'm
seeing the fact that we can fix the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment all we want, but if people
actually have, you know, the up above
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, we can fix that all we want
and get the air movement and get things
[SPEAKER_01]: right, take the hostility away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we have really bad soil conditions,
whatever environment I help fix isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: going to change the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of a two part thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why with the greenhouse
advisory group, I'm kind of pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: together a few of these different
resources or or professionals in these
[SPEAKER_01]: areas, because it's it's it's kind of a
it's I can't just do it by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know enough to do it all by
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost sounds like biodynamic growing,
you know, where you are considerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're you're thinking about nature
holistically outdoors with biodynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're all like, no, we need to take
that same holistic mindset and bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it's the it's the soil and it's
the diffusion film on the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's whether what kind of glass we're
choosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole system that works together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you damn well better plan it in
advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't just go to one greenhouse
company or another and let them
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily give us the advice if they
haven't had any cannabis background behind
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they do have cannabis background,
it's good to ask where it's from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is that cannabis
went legal in Colorado before everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: else for the, you know, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what that meant was an explosion of
greenhouses in Pueblo in Pueblo happens to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the high desert of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's you know, it's it's high
elevations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot growing out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they made it OK for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happened was is there's a
local greenhouse company in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: a very reputable one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people naturally wanted to
buy local, you know, I'm a Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a buy greenhouses from this Colorado
cannabis greenhouse company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that greenhouse company did sell a
lot of greenhouses to the cannabis space
[SPEAKER_01]: in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that same the data that they created
even out of those greenhouses isn't the
[SPEAKER_01]: same that's going to be produced out of a
greenhouse in Washington or Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: for that matter, even upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that greenhouse company went around
applying the same you know, designs to
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses in other states than than the
high desert of Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started seeing increased
hostility and failure rates associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with that, because it's not just,
you know, do what we do in Pueblo over
[SPEAKER_01]: here in in upstate New York or,
you know, out in the islands of Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: like you guys are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high deserts are really hot and dry as
a bone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually use fogging systems
and wet walls and things to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: do the things that I normally don't spend
a lot of time talking about because most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the people that I've dealt with in
cannabis have always come from this
[SPEAKER_01]: already kind of humid area where it gets
hot, like, you know, in these forests and
[SPEAKER_01]: and places in the you know, and it does
get hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong for maybe a month or
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, there's still ways to
deal with all that and not just try to get
[SPEAKER_01]: this push button.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I'm going to set my parameters like an
indoor room and and here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bugs really enjoy these hot
hostile in areas so that some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens and they also love it
underground when people are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing all these things into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also people that are fighting root
aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they dump all this other, you know,
root aphid stuff into the soil that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually disrupts the other
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's just kind of a,
you know, a lot of people chasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: tail, trying to fix one problem,
creating another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times, like I said,
we got to back up and really, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out our environments and figure out
underground environments, what's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to get these two things in harmony
so that we can actually grow stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't susceptible or sending out vectors
for pests and disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always call it sending out invitations
to the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, cannabis grows,
you can, you know, plants will send out
[SPEAKER_01]: messages to let bugs and pathogens know
that, you know, there is a party going on
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're open for business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so how about when we were talking about
ventilation earlier, you were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the folks who were concerned about
opening the windows because they open the
[SPEAKER_00]: window for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I hear that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you say to those people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you say, listen, even the sterile grows
have got, you know, spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't worry about them coming in the
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more important to get the ventilation
or, you know, what do you actually tell
[SPEAKER_00]: your clients when they're trying to make
that decision to open the window or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I actually have pictures and stuff
that shows the differences of plants being
[SPEAKER_01]: overheated and going through nutrient
lockout versus ones next to it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: diffused.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got people that have pictures that
have, you know, plants that are covered in
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites next to plants that are
completely healthy, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have any spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really hard to get across
that message.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people that I talk to are have
heard some of this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the healthier the plant,
the more resistant it is to bugs and
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a common statement in a lot
of horticulture, not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes the same with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if we're healthy, we typically
can fight off sicknesses and diseases
[SPEAKER_01]: easier than people that, you know,
choose to not be healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it kind of goes back to
the trade shows and the things where you
[SPEAKER_01]: and I have met over the course of the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the trade shows,
yeah, they're turning real techie right
[SPEAKER_01]: now for dispensaries and track and trace
and, you know, banking and all that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But historically, they've always had a lot
of the band aids, like how to clean the
[SPEAKER_01]: air, the new spray for this disease,
the new, you know, root drench to kill
[SPEAKER_01]: this disease, the new purifier to fight
this disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is this battle, you know,
band aid thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody's really looking back and
saying, OK, how can we change the band aid
[SPEAKER_01]: syndrome and get to the health of things?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's almost like big pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us choose to try to eat organic
food and get healthy and other people
[SPEAKER_01]: choose to go to the doctor and get a pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so, you know, I like to look
at the holistic way.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I got to tell you,
you know, I've I've interviewed for you a
[SPEAKER_00]: handful of times and you and I are
personal friends and I've talked to you
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've never heard you talk this much
about soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like like like and you
know, I've really gotten into soil and and
[SPEAKER_00]: can create natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this idea that that's that
sick plants put out that invitation for
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not whether or not you have the
window open at all, because if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy plants, even if the windows open,
it's not going to create a home for bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's no invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's some that's some radical
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've heard you talk about the pest
solutions via you know, mechanization of
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse or different things that
you can do with the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can I can feel that you've moved
beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, listen, the solution to the
pests is not in the greenhouse design
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually in the holistic design of
the entire greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you better damn well talk to your
soil expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's happening, though, and I found
out through working with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a soil person in particular, my buddy,
Scott, is that, you know, he found
[SPEAKER_01]: anomalies in greenhouse houses and in even
indoor rooms that exchange air,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started seeing some of the same
things, but I didn't really know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: was seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that I was kind of, I guess,
visualizing this happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wasn't I didn't I didn't have the
microscope and the data to actually go,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, my gosh, this is, you know,
solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We figured it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is it type of type
attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my confidence level in some ways
has gone up to talk about this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've found that these correlations
or these things that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: at the tip of my fingers are actually,
you know, in full grasp now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that's what's happening is that,
yeah, you can create conditions in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse that change the biology in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a new tool that I carry around besides
my infrared thermometer is I like to carry
[SPEAKER_01]: around a six inch soil probe for checking
the soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times we find that the soil
temperatures increase or decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes a higher soil temperature
will create more of a hostile environment
[SPEAKER_01]: for pathogens, bugs and things to grow or
to help create these vectors like I talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, thrips, a lot of people
have a problem with thrips and thrips like
[SPEAKER_01]: to lay their eggs where the the babies
when they hatch have something to eat and
[SPEAKER_01]: what do they eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: They eat bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we have an over bacteria
frenzy or a high nitrogen fixed soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: we easily get the thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, looking at all these
things, you know, we can make slight
[SPEAKER_01]: changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those changes have to do with
the air movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have a sealed greenhouse that's
doing mechanical ventilation and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: air coming in at one end of the
greenhouse, that's cooler than the air
[SPEAKER_01]: going out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, again, you got to remember
National Greenhouse Manufacturers
[SPEAKER_01]: Association standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to have one air exchange per
minute in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a ton of air moving in and
moving out of a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One exchange a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think about that, that's a
standard that's recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for the greenhouse world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're moving a high volume of air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is, is because as the air
travels through the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: it heats up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you think about a long,
long greenhouse, we have air coming in at
[SPEAKER_01]: one end, heating up and exiting a
different temperature than when it came
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had reports of people saying that
they had air temperatures coming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse at 75 degrees and exiting at
130.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that air is getting heated up in
under a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases, if people don't have
their calculations right, maybe that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not exchanging at one time a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do have solar gain in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't do their calcs right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't have one air exchange per
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the greenhouse is super long.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we go over 144 feet, we really see a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a problem with air having a chance
to heat up because of those long lengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main thing that, you know,
my buddy Scott pointed out was that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I saw this too in a couple of
the classes I was teaching at Oakster Dam,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plants at one end of the
greenhouse or the other would be more
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy than the rest of the whole run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I found in a couple of classes
is what the plants closest to the entry
[SPEAKER_01]: point of that cooler, fresher air weren't
doing actually as good as the plants at
[SPEAKER_01]: the other end where the 130 degree air was
exiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is because they were overwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so plants closer to that cool intake
air don't use as much water as the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: at the other end where the heat is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might think the opposite and
say, oh, the plants at the end where the
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler air would be the healthier ones
versus the one at the other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the opposite because the soil is
able to dry out and those plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though it's warmer air at that end,
the soil dries out faster because the
[SPEAKER_01]: other end of where the air is coming in,
the soil is waterlogged.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not using any water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the biology is is is it's turning into
water molds and creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But only but only at the one end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, 90 percent of the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they overwater the whole greenhouse and
the plants that did the best were where it
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air was exiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, a third of the
greenhouse was doing good at the other end
[SPEAKER_01]: where it was mostly and I would think a
little bit hostile.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at the leaf surface
temperature, they were moving so much air
[SPEAKER_01]: through there and plants are made of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like me and you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we stand in front of a fan when I'm hot
and sweaty or if I stand in a cool breeze
[SPEAKER_01]: provided by Mother Nature, my body starts
to cool down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sweat starts to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm evaporative that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so plants are the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though the air temp might have
been 130 exiting, that doesn't mean the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf surface temperature was that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so therefore that plant was actually
doing pretty dang good considering what it
[SPEAKER_01]: was going through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that the rest of its family
in that bed was being overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go on to our next greenhouse
challenge, you mentioned Scott like three
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and plug Scott,
because I don't I don't I don't personally
[SPEAKER_00]: know Scott, but I'm assuming we're talking
about Scott La Granola on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually know what his real last
name is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I follow him and I think he
follows me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but go ahead and go ahead and plug him
a sec so that so that people who are into
[SPEAKER_00]: soil can start following him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Scott La Granola is is how you say it
or how you look it up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he has a business one,
but he doesn't use it very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his company is called Crescent Soil
Services.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Scott La Granola happens to be
somebody that called me years ago when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was working answering phones at the last
job I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he called me, gosh, I want to say
like 2013 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was actually calling me to inquire
about dragonfly earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he was actually asking me
some questions about soil and some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had done some work with one of
Elaine Ingham's advisors during that time
[SPEAKER_01]: on a walnut orchard of my family's down
near Stockton.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were trying to add biology to an
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad turned organic all of a sudden on
one of his 40 acre farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we wanted to go in and add some
biology after its many years of roundup
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was involved in doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was out there, we were spraying
compost tea and everything when it really
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to be watered in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when Scott called me, he talked
about spraying compost tea on an alfalfa
[SPEAKER_01]: field or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, no, you got to water it in
and, you know, use the dragonfly that way
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I mentioned Elaine Ingham's name
and he followed her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next thing you know, he took all of
her courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done all this stuff and he became one
of her advisors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she has like 11 people that have taken
the full course and get the advisor status
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's the only one that did cannabis
out of all those 11 advisors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he created data that I believe
that, you know, blows even Elaine's
[SPEAKER_01]: information away because she started
something that, you know, she taught
[SPEAKER_01]: people and he's one of these prodigy types
that took it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can't say enough good things
about the stuff that he's learned and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching and the information that he has
about soil pests and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of gone hand in hand with my
work because a lot of the work he's done
[SPEAKER_01]: has been in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, you know, here we are working
together on some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are doing a lot of farm rescue
work or greenhouse rescue, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coincidentally, you know, it wasn't even
like it just kind of just started
[SPEAKER_01]: happening that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was actually a whole bunch of
really quality name drops in one response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody who's listening, you're
recommended to go follow Scott on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, but also Elaine Ingham was name
checked and Elaine is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also you mentioned Josh and Kelly
at Dragonfly Earth Medicine, who are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of heroes of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're not following Dragonfly
Earth Medicine, go check them out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving forward, let's talk about
inadequate size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, because a lot of people, they're
either moving from multiple smaller grows
[SPEAKER_00]: into one finally commercial grow,
or you've got people who are setting up a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow and they, you know,
they're not experienced in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they don't know how to come up with
the appropriate size to build.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then now you've got a company
that's trying to, you know, make their
[SPEAKER_00]: millions in too small of a location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you think through that with
clients of yours of how big they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you just mentioned a hundred and
more than 144 feet long, and you start
[SPEAKER_00]: running into all sorts of airflow issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be a short checklist of
that stuff that you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely have a checklist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the main thing is to see what kind
of license people are having, because in
[SPEAKER_01]: California you can get certain square
footage licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, at first people are
going for this size license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so based on that size license,
they can do X number of square foot feet
[SPEAKER_01]: of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people are also, you know,
now stacking licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of turns into this like,
you know, let's build it as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it, you know, some people just get what
they can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, there are a ton of greenhouses
that are going up for sale and for lease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's real popular to go find
something that's already built and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, fix it up or do what you want
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also a lot of the new
construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people are, yes, having to design
their own greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, designing the
greenhouse, in my opinion, is definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: an important part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just necessarily how many
fans and where we put them and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the obvious calculations and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also the workflow strategies of
being able to have small plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing in, you know, plants for
transplanting, being able to harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these things have to go on within this
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like a lot of that stuff isn't
looked at close enough when we just look
[SPEAKER_01]: at, okay, how are we going to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's grow this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much can we pump out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll dry it over here and trim it
over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it causes a lot of cross-contamination
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, since, you know, because of the
time of year it is right now, you see on a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people's Instagram feeds,
folks who are outgrowing their hoops,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, it's sad for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, like, we would never wish on
anybody the fact that their plants have
[SPEAKER_00]: grown so much that they're touching the
plastic, which, you know, touches the
[SPEAKER_00]: condensation, which creates vectors for
mold, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all know not to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also know that if you let your,
you know, if you set up your depths wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: or if your full term stuff moves too fast,
suddenly you've outgrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see a lot of people this time
of year putting, like, extenders on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of their plastic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom of the hoops to buy
themselves another 18 inches or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, obviously with a
professionally built greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a hell of a lot more difficult to
potentially impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any tricks of the trade for
fitting more into a solid greenhouse like
[SPEAKER_00]: there is for hoops or are you just stuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, in some cases, you know,
canopy management is definitely an art
[SPEAKER_01]: into itself and it's something that people
are learning to work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, historically, when we had,
you know, legal cannabis in California
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, it was all plant counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you didn't grow over 99 plants
or certain counties let you grow 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of, you know, ran everything by
plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that meant let's grow the biggest
possible plant we can grow because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: how we're going to, you know, get all
these pounds of a verb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with plant counts, yeah,
people were pushing limits and growing
[SPEAKER_01]: massive plants, definitely hitting the
roof or taking the cover off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like you've probably seen when
you're travels up north, some people grow
[SPEAKER_01]: some monster outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that, you know, it's pretty,
pretty impressive to see how big some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those outdoor plants can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we've changed the model
now to square footage licenses in this
[SPEAKER_01]: legal area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens with that is that
people want to grow more plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not quite as big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we kind of have a new learning
curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, you know, we're all kind of
getting our feet wet and growing more
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and, you know, being able to scale
up like you've been talking about to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the veg space, to be able to put plants
into this flowering space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I see a lot of people
that, yeah, take the cover of their
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse off and the plants go bananas
and they end up using the hoop as trellis
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I look at that as is a lot of
people didn't want to go greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: because it trapped too much air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found that growing outdoor was
much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't get the bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have the condensation that
created the mold and all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nine times out of 10, what it was,
was they were trapping too much air,
[SPEAKER_01]: using too clear of a cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the plants got way too big for
any airflow to happen anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ripping the cover off alleviated
all those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we backed up and were able to
educate people on the fact that you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to have the ventilation sorted
out, the proper greenhouse cover,
[SPEAKER_01]: and don't let your plants get quite as
big, you're actually going to get better
[SPEAKER_01]: results at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by better results is that
we've had a lot of this stuff tested over
[SPEAKER_01]: the course of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found is higher cannabinoids
and higher terpene profiles in stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been supported through these
greenhouse techniques and compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor or indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's two different labs that
have been saying this stuff for a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's actually a terpene company
that prefers to get greenhouse material
[SPEAKER_01]: because they usually get more terps out of
it than they would outdoor or indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I've got one more question
for you before we go to our next
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is totally a non sequitur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was down in Phoenix doing a keynote
at an Indo... No, it wasn't Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was Imperius Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I was down there to Phoenix and
I'm talking to all these folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing greenhouses out in the desert,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, like you were talking about
during first set, you wouldn't naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: think of greenhouses in the desert because
it's already hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally greenhouses were to keep
things warm, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To keep the air warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these people were talking about
they're using the greenhouse for the
[SPEAKER_00]: light, but then they're also spending all
this money on air conditioning to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was on the flight home and I got to
thinking, I'm like, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it was me and I was doing this,
I'd be really tempted to dig a big hole in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground and grow the plants below grade
and then just put a glass roof on the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of that hole so that I could use the
geothermal cooling and yet still use the
[SPEAKER_00]: hot sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever heard of that before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that even a thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's definitely a thing and there
are possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, name dropping again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friends at Dragonfly Earth Medicine
really promoted a lot of Wallopini
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses is what they call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it's called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wallopini?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, Wallopini.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we actually worked with some people
in Colorado that did one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and I know that they have one at
their farm and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they do work and they.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of on the fence because I'm on
one hand, they don't work 365,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 24 seven type of thing for what
people are trying to achieve, but they do
[SPEAKER_01]: provide some of the stuff we you're
talking about as far as cooling and
[SPEAKER_01]: heating on the thermal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But depending on where you are,
that can be really tricky to quantify that
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by the desert is really
unforgiving and you'd have to dig a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: deep hole to get any of that relief or
help from those things in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in in grass valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that matter, where I am up here,
it gets really cold in the winter time and
[SPEAKER_01]: people have tried some of these techniques
and and using warm water barrels and
[SPEAKER_01]: things in the daytime to, you know,
try to offset some or give off some heat
[SPEAKER_01]: in at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those a lot of those times they didn't
work because it's just too hot or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just too dang cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, those things help maybe in
the evening time or in the morning time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, it's not a consistent
enough situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe in the deserts you can grow
in a combination of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been to the few desert
greenhouses already.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was in Death Valley of all
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like seventy thousand square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I happened to be in Vegas consulting
on an indoor project that wanted to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so through Instagram, a buddy of mine
that I didn't even realize was out in
[SPEAKER_01]: Death Valley running a big greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we packed up, headed out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, with the wet wall going on
a hot day on one hundred and twelve,
[SPEAKER_01]: it had it down into the 70s or high 70s,
which felt really nice and was working
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, like you said, it costs money
to run those systems and to make all that
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that he did mention is that,
you know, it was getting to be monsoon
[SPEAKER_01]: season and off the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been having a lot of high pressure
or whatever systems and causing it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when it gets really humid out in
the desert or even close to San Diego,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I went to another one, those wet
walls are tricky because the humidity is
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we kind of have like I
said before, we take a few steps forward
[SPEAKER_01]: and a few steps back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, in the desert model of a
greenhouse, we have to have more
[SPEAKER_01]: flexibility of things to turn off and on
and to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought they had to clear of a
cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have used a more diffuse cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another place that I went to says,
well, we like to clear and we'll just pull
[SPEAKER_01]: out the shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you don't pull out the shade
cloth soon enough, you end up getting high
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf surface temperatures and then you're
actually closing the shade cloth and
[SPEAKER_01]: retaining that humidity because the plants
have already overheated and started to
[SPEAKER_01]: sweat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you don't catch it at the right
time, you still kind of deal with the same
[SPEAKER_01]: problem that you were hoping to avoid with
some of this fancy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot of orchestration that goes
along with it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just how you do the greenhouse
and what you put on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the orchestration and how you set it
up to operate and the parameters so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can utilize shade cloths properly,
utilize lighting, cooling, wet walls and
[SPEAKER_01]: passive ventilation when it's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, all these things work well and
can lower your cost of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you said, or like you're hearing,
people will just do one thing and they
[SPEAKER_01]: want the cooling, they run the wet wall
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't get a ridge vent or a passive
ventilation option or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They maybe didn't use a diffuse cover or
whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I find that nobody does anything
the same either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's there's definitely not a
solid set of best practices that is
[SPEAKER_00]: universally shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, it's kind of
surprising to to get to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not like greenhouses are a
new thing, but yet there are so there are
[SPEAKER_00]: so much going on as far as new thoughts,
new deployments, new implementations,
[SPEAKER_00]: new tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that now that the greenhouse world has
got so much more of us cannabis fools
[SPEAKER_00]: running around inventing things and
getting involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let's go ahead and take our second
and last short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is cannabis greenhouse
expert Eric Branstad from Greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: Advisory Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage loyalty in the customers you do
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you certainly don't have the time for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not really ready to hire
someone full time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend blunt branding at
Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten Nelson and her team are focused on
improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's pretty much the most important
part of marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale, whether it be online or
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_00]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what she did recently for Moon
Time Medicinals in Humboldt County at
[SPEAKER_00]: MoonTimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean that they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on four
projects now for various clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every single time they have done more
than they've promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: on results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making you a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every single friend I've
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just doesn't happen every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_00]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_00]: while using cutting edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this easy, automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is cannabis greenhouse expert,
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Branstad from Greenhouse Advisory
Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have talked about a whole bunch of
stuff that can go wrong, Eric.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've talked about the heat and
the pests and the mold and inadequate
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes and crazy location-based issues,
which generally tend to be heat-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of people I'm sure are feeling
overwhelmed, which is exactly why,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you've started this new approach
of greenhouse rescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take it all the way back to the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody is looking to build a
greenhouse, what should they be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for when shopping for a company?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a good question and it
can be kind of a tough question sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of the people are trying to
sell stuff and they want to get your
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to say a lot of the right
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you say, are you guys
involved in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll probably say yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, just dig a little deeper,
you know, like, can I see this cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: project?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I see videos, pictures?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I talk to maybe the person that bought
the greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like dig deep for references.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is what I like to do so that you can
really kind of vet it out and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that on one hand, they have been
successful greenhouse grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you can talk to builders even,
you know, talking to the builders to find
[SPEAKER_01]: out information on, you know, the
greenhouse itself on how that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've had a lot of builders that
build any greenhouse and they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they have their own ideas of
who's better or who's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, a lot of times it's just
getting the education background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just pick one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to get at least three quotes,
in my opinion, or three bids to find out
[SPEAKER_01]: the differences because there's
engineering timelines that are different
[SPEAKER_01]: with everybody needing to get building
permits these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's also in a hurry to get
their project going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Engineering timelines and how soon you can
get those blueprints to the county so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can apply for your permit can be a
deal maker or breaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: The timeline that it takes from pulling
the trigger on the actual greenhouse to
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to get the metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long is it going to take to,
you know, get it built?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of these factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you talk to three different
greenhouse companies, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: three different answers to all those
questions, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on where you are at your
greenhouse project, one or two of those
[SPEAKER_01]: differences is going to help you make that
decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not all just price these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shouldn't be a lot of people bottom
line shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just look at that bottom line and go
that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that's what gets people in
the most trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying spending more is better,
but I'm saying paying attention to all
[SPEAKER_01]: these things is more important than bottom
line shopping, because what's the point of
[SPEAKER_01]: buying a fairly inexpensive piece of
equipment and not being there for another
[SPEAKER_01]: year or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I'll take the extra step in
and suggest people call somebody like you,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, you're the only person I
know who's doing this right now for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who's a greenhouse strategist,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not trying to sell you a product,
because you used to be that guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You used to sell greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over your 10 plus years of experience,
you've realized what the score is on
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody like you is a pretty smart
first call, because the money that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: save in calling you to give me some
direction and just business reconnaissance
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be saved many times over when
I actually go to build or rescue a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people should do that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to look for a greenhouse
company with serious references that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be checked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might consider reaching out to
somebody like you who's got a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective and isn't allied to any brand
or product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, they get something built,
and then the company hands you the keys,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have heard you talk about this at
length about somebody gets a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know how to make it function,
to make it sing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you are helping somebody
mentally and emotionally move into their
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a big stage in a company's
overall arc.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of hints do you give them for
getting a greenhouse up and running?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that you've got some initial best
practices that you give your clients so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they get off on the right foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things I try to say
is even start out small inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just because you have a giant
greenhouse or even a whatever size
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse, I mean, you don't have to
necessarily fill the whole thing up or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, start out of the gate at full
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to start out with a small
workflow practice and start to ramp up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ramp up fairly quickly,
but I see people going in head first
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be actually too big of a pill
to swallow because some of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we set up or design or workflow things,
you know, they need some tweaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: They aren't going to be set in stone and
perfect right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within those adjustments, we find
better efficiencies and weed out some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that won't work in the long run
before we go head first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would think that a lot of these best
practices is, you know, how to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but and you know, especially for if
something if they're paying for the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would also think that there are a
lot of things as far as like more than
[SPEAKER_00]: workflow, like the steps that the
employees take around the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that those are somehow more
unique or differently unique for
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses than they are, for example,
an indoor warehouse grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I take a lot of information or what
I've seen from indoor grows now and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply them to the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is the workflow of
of being clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people I see in their
greenhouses will go from the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that might have vectors going on
and who knows or actually have problems
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can visually see, you know,
go around those plants, touch them,
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about them, this, that and the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go over and let's look at the
moms and the baby, the cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people need to understand
that there is cross contamination going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when we're harvesting,
we're taking trays of harvested plants
[SPEAKER_01]: past, you know, the cloning room or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of people passing,
passing each other in the halls where we
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have to establish a workflow that
means the clean, you know, the the veg and
[SPEAKER_01]: the cutting people stay with those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before you move over to the flowering
or vice versa, we actually change our
[SPEAKER_01]: clothes and go through a procedure of
cleaning and decontamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we have two different crews.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have a veg and cloning crew
and the flowering crews over here and they
[SPEAKER_01]: do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't actually cross each other in
the halls or pathways when we're hauling
[SPEAKER_01]: trays of clones and another person has a
rack of harvested plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I see that really all too often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that I see that's
happening is a landscape plan in the sense
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's easy to build the greenhouse and
make that all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out in a sweet space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we have dusty driveways and dust
surrounding everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every time someone drives a golf
cart by, every time a visitor,
[SPEAKER_01]: an inspector pulls up, every time a worker
walks by or the dogs are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing their playing right there,
we're creating all this dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, that dust is getting
everywhere on the plants and creating its
[SPEAKER_01]: own set of problems, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, a lot of the best practices I
see have to go into with cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean like white glove tech,
but we got to put wrap our heads around
[SPEAKER_01]: some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's kind of basic from my
perspective, like landscape dust control
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, not carrying clones past
flowering plants or harvested plants is
[SPEAKER_01]: just like a no brainer, but it's just
everybody's doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've talked to quite a few
greenhouse folks this year who were really
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about either their new
greenhouse that was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: still had the new car smell on it,
or their rehab greenhouse around the
[SPEAKER_00]: wildfires that we've been having so
hardcore the last two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Down near where you are in Grass Valley
was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy up in Canada right now where I
am in the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got fires in Oregon and Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any best practices for
greenhouses when there's a wildfire
[SPEAKER_00]: nearby?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're still dealing with air
exchanges and opening vents and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke gets into our homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to keep the smoke out, but
depending on the level of smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people don't have air
conditioning in their homes, so they rely
[SPEAKER_01]: on opening windows to, you know,
to live in their homes throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so smoke is definitely a hot topic,
but it's something that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even really have a big answer on
that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly, you know, trying to go in and
be able to spray your plants off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, spraying them with water alone
when they're in veg to try to rinse any
[SPEAKER_01]: particulate off, things like that be an
option.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, I'm starting to
look to the labs to see what they say
[SPEAKER_01]: about the level of contamination on these
plants to try to get an idea of where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, if it's smoky,
how smoky does it have to be to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: affect your plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how long does it have to sit there for
for it actually to be a problem and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you know, that's a little bit new
territory that I'm looking into and asking
[SPEAKER_01]: the same questions about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hopefully I'll have some more solid
answers as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, yeah, it's a scary,
scary situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my last question for you today,
we're going to go back to the ultra
[SPEAKER_00]: basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know that you have been doing
light depth way for a long time and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all the way back to where people
were using refrigerator boxes around one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this is the time of year
where people are putting away their depth
[SPEAKER_00]: tarps and people will be soon putting away
their, you know, their their their reg
[SPEAKER_00]: seed tarps, you know, their full their
full season greenhouse pollies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you know, people are going to be
putting this stuff away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've dealt with these materials for,
you know, your whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you recommend that people get,
you know, put these things away,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean them and put them away for the year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've seen everything from people
wash them down and put them away and they
[SPEAKER_00]: mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other people just take them and
they roll them up and they and they just
[SPEAKER_00]: go buy a new one next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as somebody who's been
around this since it is seasonally
[SPEAKER_00]: correct, do you have any pointers for
folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the main thing is, is, yeah,
roll it up and put it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't worry too much about
washing it off before you put it away,
[SPEAKER_01]: because, yeah, if you don't dry it really
good and get everything dry, you end up
[SPEAKER_01]: getting some mold because water's trapped
for the winter in those folds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having a dry dusty tarp folded up
isn't a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can rinse it off in the spring when
you get it out again and clean it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you get it hanging up,
maybe even before you have plants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse type of thing, it's easy to
hose it inside and outside and and things
[SPEAKER_01]: stay dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But rolling it up and putting it away in a
place that isn't going to get hit with
[SPEAKER_01]: mice or rats, because one thing that
happens to Polly that's rolled up and put
[SPEAKER_01]: in the garage is we find mice that go bore
a hole in these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then when you go unroll it or
unfold it, we have a little hole every
[SPEAKER_01]: five feet, you know, the whole,
you know, three quarters of the length of
[SPEAKER_01]: the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So putting things away and knowing that
they're going to be secured from animals,
[SPEAKER_01]: pine cones, you know, damaging elements
and things like that is really important
[SPEAKER_01]: because I store mine or I used to store
mine every year and the mice would always
[SPEAKER_01]: be my biggest threat for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it comes to all the other
equipment, I mean, the greenhouses are
[SPEAKER_01]: made for winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most everything as far as fans and
bearings and all that stuff are sealed and
[SPEAKER_01]: prepacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a hoop house, I always recommend
and you're only using it in the summertime
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part or the spring in the
summer is take the cover off for the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter time, because if if we get a snow
that pops up and it's easily collapses
[SPEAKER_01]: hoop houses, even if they say that they
can handle some snow, they really
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have a tough time because most hoop
houses are all hoop houses have a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a flat spot at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to see with the naked eye,
but it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have that flat spot and you
have snow building up on it, it can sneak
[SPEAKER_01]: up on you really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's no fun having a greenhouse
collapse on you when all you had to do was
[SPEAKER_01]: really take the skin off for the winter
time and let it snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and there wouldn't have been a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So winterizing your greenhouses is
definitely very important for those that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to protect the cover and
protect the frame at all costs and makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it less likely that you will need a
greenhouse rescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Eric, thank you so much for taking
the time to be with us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got this this,
you know, decade plus amount of experience
[SPEAKER_00]: and somehow we have to distill it down
for, you know, a 90 minute show somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I think we were able to get,
you know, enough of the problems that
[SPEAKER_00]: enough of the solutions out there to get
people thinking about it and to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: on the road to a road to recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun hanging with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you soon.
