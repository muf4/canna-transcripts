[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm talking to clients,
they often are asking me, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: help me envision what's gonna be going on
five or 10 or 20 years down because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're putting in millions and millions
of dollars and they wanna have a long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: arc of their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first of all, I tell them that
nobody's got a crystal ball and thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: that anybody knows what this chaos is
gonna look like in 10 or 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're overcharging you for their
consulting, right, whoever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we all do need to
think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two things that will radically change
the oil market when it happens will be,
[SPEAKER_00]: A, the allowing of interstate commerce in
the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of time before that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of these states that are
becoming legal now, they've got these
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice oil grows and any
manufacturing setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're great, but their margins,
their cost of doing business is really
[SPEAKER_00]: high, right, because of where they live or
their weather or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as soon as people are allowed to
ship over state lines, suddenly California
[SPEAKER_00]: and the southern part of the country are
gonna be producing these same products
[SPEAKER_00]: with a very low cost of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then wait until international gets
involved and Mexico can grow this
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful flower, organic certified if
they choose to, process all the oil down
[SPEAKER_00]: there with world class and then just ship
up drums of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just gonna crush, like for
example, the edibles market, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's not artisan dab oil,
it's more of a commoditized oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that you give good advice to
people both here in the US and around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you telling the people who
seek your advice about how to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: those two barriers, interstate and then
national barriers coming down as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up local businesses to provide
oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question because it's
economy of scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they start to be able to pull like
CBD derived turps out of hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then with plant infused terpene
infusions, all of a sudden you're really
[SPEAKER_01]: able to make it a very simple method to
create some of these lower quality oil
[SPEAKER_01]: packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is over the next 20
years, will you be able to develop a new
[SPEAKER_01]: group of people, new consumers who wanna
consume the products that are grown in
[SPEAKER_01]: their region where they're more aware of
locally produced products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically to me the fundamental
about organic ag is that if you're really
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at it, part of the organic nature
of it is it isn't being trucked across
[SPEAKER_01]: seven states to get to your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to say you're an
environmental advocate when you're having
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff shipped in globally into your
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's trying to create the awareness
that you wanna have local products,
[SPEAKER_01]: local goods because they should be cheaper
unless we're so inefficient in our
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you allow the places that do bulk oil
production to do bulk oil production and
[SPEAKER_01]: you focus on what you're supposed to focus
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really the reality of ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Humboldt has problems because we don't
have a lot of flat ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's really not a lot of prime
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of flat ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't allow us to do massive
central valley type farming operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we have is a tremendous amount of
clean air and un-toxic regions because we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have all these other industries
contaminating and so that's the problem
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're seeing in all these massive
agricultural areas is cross-contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to create these positive
pressure greenhouses to expel any air
[SPEAKER_01]: that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that's coming in is coming in
through massive filtration systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that has to be a cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it starts to become so expensive to
create products in areas that were ag
[SPEAKER_01]: regions because cannabis is being
regulated to the degree that no ag product
[SPEAKER_01]: has ever been regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can't really grow cannabis in
the wineries that well because you have so
[SPEAKER_01]: much mycoputurin all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all applied for all the grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't use cannabis in the central
valley to the same degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a look how many of these
failures are coming from the central
[SPEAKER_01]: valley, even the larger organizations,
they're having to remodel the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they get all that in, it's still
unbelievably expensive infrastructure to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we go forward, does the consumer
become educated enough to realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's industrial cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: When they want to buy cannabis,
are they going to look at it like wine?
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point where there's many gradients
of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the price in a store.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as people start to become more aware,
and I believe that the youth that are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in are very cognizant about these
facts because they've been barred with it
[SPEAKER_01]: since their childhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't get the same advertising we
did that it's, hey, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These products are good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluoride is great for your teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should get as much as you can in your
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you know it's a neurotoxin,
it changes how you perceive these
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that for a lot of the smaller
places that have such a risk, it's trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to create zones of enjoyment where people
who really are about the culture and the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality can know to source their products
and buy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really over time of educating
the customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the customer education has to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all we've done is educate them that
cheaper, more hot numbers, more frosty,
[SPEAKER_01]: better pictures on Instagram of what you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has absolutely nothing to do with
reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's the ability to get people
to understand the reality of that these
[SPEAKER_01]: ugly tomatoes that they won't sell at the
store are the exact ones you want to cut
[SPEAKER_01]: up and eat on your sandwich.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why farmers markets sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully the new generation is able
to make these decisions and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, if I want to consume cannabis,
I'd like to consume it from craft regions
[SPEAKER_01]: where the environmental impact is low,
where the farmers are known.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm at a fair price.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is you're trying to get people
to pay higher prices for this extra
[SPEAKER_01]: effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a population of people
globally that buy cannabis that really
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't cash rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their disposable income is less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's global.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the global situation,
so the 1% can afford to buy what they
[SPEAKER_01]: want, but they're not the cannabis
consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everyone below them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's trying to be able to figure
out how do the farmers get themselves into
[SPEAKER_01]: very specific niches of acknowledgement,
where people recognize their products,
[SPEAKER_01]: they recognize the region, they recognize
the farmers, and they recognize that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're fairly priced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that starts to allow you to be
competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as these products start to move across
the borders, then all other high level
[SPEAKER_01]: products, small niche products move across
borders too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why wouldn't we be able to move our
products across these borders and allow
[SPEAKER_01]: the cheaper products to come in to allow
people who have a less price point get
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis enjoyment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not about taxing people to
death.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to create a gradient where the
poorest person can afford the product,
[SPEAKER_01]: the richest person can afford a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they may get different products in
terms of the fine qualities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fundamentally, the poorest person
still has an edible quality product where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no toxins, no contaminants,
and it gives them the effect they desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the upper echelon of subtleties that
you have to basically develop a palette
[SPEAKER_01]: for to even appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we can do that and educate it,
so really to me, this is a 20 year cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the part that's so scary is
that, can we survive 20 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
