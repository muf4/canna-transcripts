[SPEAKER_00]: In the days of complete cannabis
prohibition, cannabis folks didn't have as
[SPEAKER_00]: much access to advanced science,
to complex analytical technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: or most of the great scientists who are
now feeling more comfortable to sign on to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-related research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, our entire scene,
including heritage cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: newcomers to cannabis, and big
agriculture, are all rejiggering their
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship to both cannabis and
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the science, like terpene and
potency tests, are clearly a win and few
[SPEAKER_00]: question their usefulness, even though we
are still questioning their accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other end of the spectrum is full on
genetically modified cannabis DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: and while that is already happening in
labs, the vast number of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers are not very supportive of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each cannabis consumer needs to decide for
themselves how much science they want in
[SPEAKER_00]: their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: No part of today's discussion is GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: No part of this discussion involves
genetic insertion into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's discussion is heavy on science
technique, though, and much of it
[SPEAKER_00]: describes lab techniques that are new to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though some of the vocabulary may
be new, and some of the techniques may
[SPEAKER_00]: sound like science fiction, they in no way
degrade the cannabis genome or the pool of
[SPEAKER_00]: available genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the techniques actually preserve
cannabis genetics, for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's episode is all about tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do this topic because I have a
poor understanding of it, and I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: general aversion to laboratories as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet there's so much science in
cannabis discussions today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my early research into tissue
culture, I realized that most cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: folks were using the term tissue culture
really loosely without a firm
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of the concepts we were
talking about, including myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of today's episode is to
translate tissue culture for the lay
[SPEAKER_00]: person with nothing more than a high
school understanding of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the episode will focus on
micropropagation, since that is mostly the
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of tissue culture we use in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll round out the show in the third
set by discussing all the tricks that fall
[SPEAKER_00]: under the umbrella of the general term
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wash your hands and get ready for some
time in the lab.

[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan recently appeared on Shaping Fire
episode 64 about feminized seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: female only breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about the
application of tissue culture techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for having me again,
Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, man, let's start by clarifying what
tissue culture really is because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: most folks throw around that term pretty
darn loosely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you give us a quick overview of like
the total breadth of the term,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then hone in a bit more on what people
in the cannabis industry usually intend
[SPEAKER_00]: when they use the term tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think tissue culture is really like an
overarching term.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like saying cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different ways that you
can grow a plant and tissue culture is
[SPEAKER_01]: really the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we say tissue culture, really what
we're doing is we're culturing plants or
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of plants in a glass test tube or
some type of plastic or glass sterilized
[SPEAKER_01]: vessel, and we call those pieces of plants
X plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess a little bit of history might
help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around the turn of the 20th century,
like 1900s, scientists were starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn about bacteria and fungus and how
they could grow these things on petri
[SPEAKER_01]: dish, and I guess a German biologist
wondered if he could do the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: with plants or plant parts, and so he
started harvesting leaves and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cross-sections of stems and
little bits of cells, and they would take
[SPEAKER_01]: the cells and mash them all up and create
something called a suspension culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they would see, you know, like we can
grow these very small bacteria and fungi,
[SPEAKER_01]: can we also do the same with plant cells?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that brings up a term called
totapotency, which really means the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to anything cell to regenerate a
whole plant from that one cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that like stem cells?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have cannabis, or not cannabis,
all plants have, they're the equivalent of
[SPEAKER_01]: stem cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them callus, which is really,
stem cells are what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: undifferentiated tissue, and usually when
we make callus, it's a de-differentiated
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue, and so that means you might have a
cell type that was like, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make cuttings, the cells along
the stem, they're at that point in time,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're stem cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean stem cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cells from the stem of a plant,
and when we cut those little branches off
[SPEAKER_01]: and expose it to a high oxygen,
high moisture environment like you'd find
[SPEAKER_01]: in a rooting puck or a rockwool cube or
something, that encourages the cell to
[SPEAKER_01]: change its cell type and become a root
cell, and so when we actually see roots
[SPEAKER_01]: growing out of the side of a cutting,
that's de-differentiation, that cell has
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiated itself from a stem type
cell to a root type cell, and so we can
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulate that process, or we've learned
that we can manipulate that process,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we can take very tiny pieces of
plants, like we can section out just the
[SPEAKER_01]: meristem, which is a very small structure
in the tip of a plant shoot, that produces
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire plantlet, but that's where all
the cell division takes place,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's about the size of a pin,
and you can cut those out and grow them on
[SPEAKER_01]: these agar mediums like we're talking
about, and eventually culture that little
[SPEAKER_01]: piece into a full plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the DNA of the plant that's driving
all this, because the instructions are
[SPEAKER_00]: there in every single cell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would consider the meristem
actually an organ, so it's not just the
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an organized cell type that are
dividing in a specific genetic program,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's probably a little more advanced
than just the DNA, thinking of it as just
[SPEAKER_01]: the DNA or a couple of cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually an actively dividing organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if we've got this big
umbrella, which is tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: and over the course of the show,
we're gonna talk about a bunch of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are under this umbrella of tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my best understanding of it is
that 80 or 90% of what we're doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, as far as tissue culture goes,
all falls into the subsection of
[SPEAKER_00]: micropropagation, and then the other 10 or
20% are all this random things that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna talk about mostly in the third set,
but am I getting it right that
[SPEAKER_00]: micropropagation is really what just about
everybody in cannabis is talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: when we talk about tissue culture,
like off the cuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really the focus right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that serves an industry need to be
able to produce large amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: virus-free, mold-free, pest-free plants,
and we can do that using micropropagation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's other types of things that we
can do, and there's something called a
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolite reactor, a bioreactor,
and at one point in time, scientists were
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure out if we could get
cannabis cells to produce cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: without having to actually grow the plant
during this crazy prohibition area that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've kind of just graduated from,
but you could do something like take some
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves off of the plant and chop them up
very, very finely using a delicate blender
[SPEAKER_01]: or some kind of sectioning device,
and then you suspend those cells into a
[SPEAKER_01]: big, like a big Erlenmeyer flask,
one of those big kind of triangle-shaped
[SPEAKER_01]: flasks that sits on a orbital shaker or a
spinning shaker, and that just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: shakes the soup broth gently and provides
lots of oxygen, and these cells just float
[SPEAKER_01]: around in the medium, and the thought was
that perhaps we could get these plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce cannabinoids, because that's
actually been, you're able to do that with
[SPEAKER_01]: other plant species, but it turned out
that, of course, the production of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids needs the resin glands,
the trichomes, so we actually can't do
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but you can use that same technique
to grow embryos or produce something
[SPEAKER_01]: called artificial seeds, which are
essentially little shoot tips encased in
[SPEAKER_01]: an alginate or an agar jelly, it looks
like a little jelly bean, and I'll try to
[SPEAKER_01]: put some of those up on my Instagram page
so people can see those while we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they're just essentially little
ways that we can produce different plant
[SPEAKER_01]: parts in these glass beakers, but like you
said, the most common thing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry is to use those to grow
plantlets, sterile plantlets, which we can
[SPEAKER_01]: either section by subculturing and
multiply them into a whole army of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Army of plants, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of us, we just want to overgrow,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Army of plants, bring it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, the truth is, these large
production systems that we're seeing start
[SPEAKER_01]: to be grown all over California,
Washington, they require armies of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grape growers are pretty lucky,
or even hop growers are pretty lucky,
[SPEAKER_01]: you plant the crop once and then it just
keeps growing year after year,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas cannabis, if you're harvesting
maybe two times in a summer or three if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really organized, you need a full
complement of plants to be planted every
[SPEAKER_01]: year or every planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really, the production of armies of
plants will be part of this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if we are talking about
creating armies of plants as being like
[SPEAKER_00]: the primary usage of tissue culture in
cannabis, let's focus on this
[SPEAKER_00]: micropropagation because it's what
everybody's talking about anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a strategy to multiply a plant
very quickly under very clean controls in
[SPEAKER_00]: a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, my understanding of it is
essentially cloning, but with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptionally immature plant material,
like at the cellular level, cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you walk us through what that,
the science of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the idea of even handling and
manipulating the cells is one step removed
[SPEAKER_00]: from my understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So walk us through that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so these agar containers,
we'll call them, are tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: vessels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to think of it like a
plant in a pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just like you're making, you're
transplanting any plant into a container,
[SPEAKER_01]: the tissue culture vessel holds,
it does all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a place for the plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the medium, sorry, the hormones and
the food source, the nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_01]: needed by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also put some sugar in there and some
other hormones that'll help the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it goes along.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's such a perfect space and a
perfect environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta remember, when we put a little
piece of an X plant or a little piece of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant into that tissue culture medium,
there's no roots, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is just like a little cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant has to be able to absorb
everything that it needs from that jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the problems is that that
environment is so suited to growing
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, even other molds and bacteria,
that if the plant part is not completely
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilized before we put it in the jar,
it may bring in a virus or a bacteria or a
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that fungus or bacteria will then be
able to propagate itself much,
[SPEAKER_01]: much more quickly than the plant part that
we've put in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what we call contamination
of the vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to autoclave these jars at very
high temperature and pressure before we
[SPEAKER_01]: put the plant in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all sealed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make your medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add your hormones and your food and
your sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that all goes in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put it in the pressure cooker
and autoclave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sterilizes the plant medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next step is cooling that
material down and letting the agar harden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we use something called a laminar
flow hood, which is essentially a very
[SPEAKER_01]: high quality HEPA filter that creates an
airflow that passes through this filter
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any air that comes in contact with the
plant has actually had all the fungus and
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses and bacteria been removed from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the same kind of hood that I'm
talking about with people who are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same kind of process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the same with the idea is that you
want to maintain sterility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really want the only organism that
you're putting into the pot is your
[SPEAKER_01]: target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, your target.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either cannabis or, like you said,
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go on, let's break down a little
bit about this petri dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, what's agar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Agar is like an extract from seaweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're walking by the seaside,
sometimes you pick up seaside and they've
[SPEAKER_01]: got these little kind of jelly balls on
them or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they take it and they, you know,
they'll extract it from these plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: boil it all down and purify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really all that it does is it gives a
matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It adds some solidify.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a solidifying agent for your liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were talking about the bioreactors
before or the embryo culture reactors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have these little plant parts in
sugar water with all the right nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and hormones and your solution is actively
moving around so that it's being oxidized,
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygenated, you can actually grow these
plant parts just in the liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the agar adds like a solid aspect to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just solidifies the medium and it kind
of makes it more stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the plant can remain upright in
that agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it kind of like a neutral and inert
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just they're kind of like to hold
shit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just a medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you also said that in this agar,
you're putting these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny plant cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like we've already talking about at
a cellular level, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, when I make a clone,
it's a pretty big cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how small of the cuttings are placed in
these Petri dishes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are we talking about like,
you know, an inch that we've cut with a
[SPEAKER_00]: scalpel or are we talking about like a
sliver?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, how small is small?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, they, ideally, you want them
to be small because the bigger,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bigger the plant, the more opportunity
that we're going to have missed some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteria or the viruses or the molds
in our sterilization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to get down to pretty small,
just by getting down to a pretty small
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a centimeter?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go that small.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the pet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, again, we're talking, you know,
we can do all these different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually use pieces of leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use cross sections of stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can try to do roots or you can grow
the meristem, like I was talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or even the auxiliary bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, if you imagine a plant
that's growing, we've got the shoots
[SPEAKER_01]: coming off the top and then you might
have, say, three leaves coming off,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, two on one side of the stem and
one on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everywhere that a leaf stem or the
petiole meets the main stem junction,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, there's a space where a new branch
will grow and any grower knows this,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you, if you watch plants, that the
leaf, that the new shoots always come out
[SPEAKER_01]: between a leaf and the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that little spot on the,
on the crotch of the, you can call it the
[SPEAKER_01]: crotch of the, the plant in between the
stem and the shoot, that actually has what
[SPEAKER_01]: it was called an auxiliary bud or a,
and that is just the place on the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: where that shoot will grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can actually, we can actually
cut all the, the, the leaves off and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just plant the node where that piece
of the, the shoot will grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's no, you got to consider,
there's no leaves, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've cut them all off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because there's no leaves,
that plant can't harvest CO2 from the air,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've put sugar into the medium
directly because photos, sugar is,
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar is the byproduct of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by putting sugar in the medium,
we kind of bypass that photosynthesis step
[SPEAKER_01]: and allow the plant to have access to
these, these molecules so they can just
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate them rather than having to
synthesize them themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that little growth that occurs in
the crotch, is that the meristem?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a, there is a meristem in the
auxiliary bud, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So define that, would you, meristem?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the meristem is, it's kind of like the
center of generation for all the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you look at the top of a growing
plant where the leaves are growing and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can, you know, you can get in there and
fold the leaves down and try to get to
[SPEAKER_01]: that most central point, that most central
point where everything is growing out of
[SPEAKER_01]: is the meristem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, think of it like a worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't know if people have ever
heard of this experiment where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: take a worm and cut it in half and both
halves will live, and they can regenerate
[SPEAKER_01]: their own parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the same with cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywhere that there's an auxiliary or an
apical meristem, and the apical meristem
[SPEAKER_01]: is just the one on the very top of the
plant, that thing can generate an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: new plant from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of think of it like the source
code, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the central meristemness of the
cannabis plant only present in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the plant or is it everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, like, you know,
I'm not super good at making clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, I have put a lot of
effort into making my cone or my clone
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts, you know, right there at the point
where the, you know, the new growth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves are on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, oh, this is supposed to be
where all the new hormones are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, really careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are you telling me that like most of
the plant can be used as a clone in kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like a random way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are these meristems only a few places
on the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, anywhere that the stem meets a leaf
junction, there's going to be a meristem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but using tissue culture, we can
actually also get the plant to produce new
[SPEAKER_01]: meristems from other parts of tissues
where they don't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, yeah, it's kind of a weird
thing, but we can take a leaf and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: what we call, people might have noticed
when you're rooting cuttings, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: the stem goes through a stage before the
roots start growing out where they kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: swell a little bit and they become like a
little bit of a rough bumpy texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called callus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And callus is kind of the intermediate or
what we think of as the stem cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's de-differentiated tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tissue that's kind of, it hasn't been
genetically destined to do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can kind of become anything at that
point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Callus can become a root.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be encouraged to become a shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you really have to encourage the plant
using hormones to do, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to guide it down the path that you want it
to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for going down that with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more ingredient in those petri
dishes I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that we're going to add a little
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious to know like what kind of
sugar and why sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we use it in compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about that all the time on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in this particular
application, why are we using it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, sugar, you know,
sugar is the end result of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hits the cells in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a whole reaction that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what essentially comes out the other
end is sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we, there is a form of sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we actually use sucrose to just go
to the grocery store and buy a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gets, you know, it gets,
it gets mixed in at like, I can't even
[SPEAKER_01]: remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a few grams per liter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so essentially we bypass the
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just put the sugar directly into
the food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way the plant has a carbon
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, like I said, if you cut off all
the leaves and we're just trying to grow a
[SPEAKER_01]: little auxiliary bud from a small piece of
stem and there's no leaf, there's no way
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant to harvest CO2 from the air
or the explant to harvest CO2 from the
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we kind of bypass that process and
put the sugar right into the, into the
[SPEAKER_01]: medium so that the plant can actually suck
that up through, you know, the piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant that's in contact with the
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were talking earlier about how,
like what an opportunity this environment
[SPEAKER_00]: is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, okay, we're gonna,
we're gonna, we're gonna try to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, you know, plantlets in this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but it would love to grow fungus and,
you know, probably bacteria and anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else that happens to be in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the, you know, what are the
sterile conditions that have to be set and
[SPEAKER_00]: generally how are those made in this
tissue culture environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming this is, you know,
a tissue culture lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's all done in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I'd like to use the cut finger
analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, if you're out working away in
the garden or in your shop or whatever and
[SPEAKER_01]: you cut your finger, you get a big old
deep gash on your finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing you do is you run it under
water and take the blood away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you want to sterilize it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to clean it up so that there's no
bacteria or things that are gonna start
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because our body is, you know,
the inside of your body, we've got all
[SPEAKER_01]: these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a perfect place for a bacteria
to come and set up home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so too is the tissue culture vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want it to be completely sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sterile just means that we've,
we've killed 100% of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fungal spores and any viruses or any
other organisms that might be living in
[SPEAKER_01]: the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do that by, we make a big batch of
this, of our agar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we pour say 25 milliliters into a
small baby food size jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those get special lids on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can stack, you know,
a whole bunch of those in an autoclave or
[SPEAKER_01]: a pressure cooker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for anybody that's ever done canning,
you know, canned fruits or jams or even,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, different vegetables or whatever
that you can can meats.
[SPEAKER_01]: We seal up the lids in these jars and we
put them in a large container,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a pressure cooker.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's essentially like a big,
it's more or less a bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a big metal container that we
heat from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put water in the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we seal it all up and then we
heat it from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the heating it from the bottom creates
a steam inside this big vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have all these big really locks
and tighteners and fasteners that hold the
[SPEAKER_01]: lid down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a serious piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually, by letting the steam
build up, it gets to a really high
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, but the pressure also
increases immensely inside this vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will actually sterilize anything
that's in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kills all the bacteria and it kills all
the fungal spores or anything that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that when we take it off the stove and
we let it cool back down and releasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: steam from the container, those jars can
then be taken over to the laminar flow
[SPEAKER_01]: hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually take the whole autoclave or
the whole, not the whole autoclave,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the whole container over to your
laminar flow hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we take the jars out and let them cool
in the laminar flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once they've come out of this
pressurization process, the sterilization
[SPEAKER_01]: process, they only exist in an environment
where there's no bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a lot of lab experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this question very well may illustrate
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it kind of sounds to me like this
pressure cooker that you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: is the exact opposite of using a vac oven
that we use in a lab as well, like where
[SPEAKER_00]: the vac oven is trying to create different
atmosphere by creating a vacuum,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas this is doing the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to ultra pressurize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also to create an unlivable
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I anywhere accurate on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hot damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates an unlivable environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anything that's gone through the
process dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that point on, it's what we
call sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so think of, when we were talking
about the laminar flow hood, this sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: air environment, think of that literally
like a surgical suite or a surgical room.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the doctors and the nurses go in to
do surgery, they're all gowned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got special gloves on and masks on
that are stopping them from breathing,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like everybody knows about masks
during COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's the same process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want your doctors to have on a mask so
that they're not blowing out bacteria into
[SPEAKER_01]: the open patient that's lying in front of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can kind of think of the sterile
jar as like the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime you open it, there's a risk that
we're gonna introduce, again, either a
[SPEAKER_01]: virus, a bacteria, a pest, or some fungus
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really, this whole process,
we want to do in the absence of all those
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've established really well,
really, really well what are in these
[SPEAKER_00]: Petri dishes, let's kind of reorient
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So explain how the cannabis industry right
now is using this for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is one of these Petri dishes going to make
a gazillion plantlets and all these little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny ass clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it gonna be one Petri dish per
clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it really won't be one Petri dish per
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the stage, it gets to be
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we think about it, there's really
a few parts to tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first part is the sterilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we go into something called
initiation, where we actually put the
[SPEAKER_01]: sterile piece of plant material into the
jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put that plant material into the
jar and put the lid on, take it to your
[SPEAKER_01]: sterile culture room, that plant will
actually grow inside the jar for say two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after two weeks, you come back
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take that plant part, or that
grown plant part out of the jar under,
[SPEAKER_01]: laminar flow again in this sterile
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can cut it up into probably two or
three or maybe five new shoots and plant
[SPEAKER_01]: each of them again in their own jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's called subculturing,
where we actually take one culture vessel,
[SPEAKER_01]: we take it out, divide it into multiple
plant parts, and then create five new
[SPEAKER_01]: vessels, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: In doing that, we've skipped the step of
having to sterilize five times those
[SPEAKER_01]: individual plants that are going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the beauty of subculturing is that you
can essentially multiply your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material without having to go through the
initiation process again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so if you think of doing that,
one plant goes into the jar, two weeks of
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative growth, we take it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've now got a plant that we can cut out
five plant parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of those goes into their own
individual jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can go back into the culture room for
another two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what comes out is 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of mothers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like regular old mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in the same way, it is very much
like the mother process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the mothering process is all done in a
greenhouse environment or a grower
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're subject to bacteria and molds
and fungus and anything else that's
[SPEAKER_01]: floating around in the air or what's
brought in with the cultivators as they
[SPEAKER_01]: come in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're bringing bugs in on their
clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a different way of doing the
same thing in a sterile environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can imagine the logarithmic curve
that you get after, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you go one to five, five to 25,
the next multiplication is 125.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next multiplication is well over 600.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really starts to grow exponentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it takes a period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to plant a million cuttings in
a year, you have to start today,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does allow you to hit this critical
mass where, like I said, the
[SPEAKER_01]: multiplication becomes exponential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got this one original plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For lack of vocabulary, I'm going to call
this the mother, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the plant that we want to make a
bunch of because we want to micropropagate
[SPEAKER_00]: it, because we're going to fill our field,
our cultivation facility with it or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would think that there are
some attributes we would want this mother
[SPEAKER_00]: to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it to have a good terpene profile
and good potency and all the regular stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: we're used to, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we are doing it in the lab and
we are doing the sorcery with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that there are other
attributes that we would be looking for in
[SPEAKER_00]: our plant that makes it appropriate for
micropropagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we look for in a plant that
makes it especially a good candidate for
[SPEAKER_00]: micropropagation?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is that nobody is currently
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know what plants make good
micropropagation plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is a really interesting
species in many, many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in one of the ways it's really
interesting is that every single trait
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can consider in the plant,
there's almost always a great amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, let's just talk about
height.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have tall plants, medium plants,
short plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yielding plants, low yielding,
medium yielding, high yielding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpene plants, you can have low levels of
terpenes, high levels of terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point that I'm trying to make is
that any trait that we can look at in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, there's a continuum of performance
for that trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And currently, the way that we're doing
tissue culture is people are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis the way they normally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're selecting the plants that they
want to be ideal for their production
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we've selected the plant,
we get our blue gene or our cookies or OG
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out of the end of whatever process
we're doing to select plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then take those plants back into the
tissue culture system and see how well
[SPEAKER_01]: they perform in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've come to learn over the past 15
or 20 years that there is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: different plants perform either well or
poorly in micropropagation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants just don't like the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want more vitamin B or they want a
specific hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't grow quickly when you put
them into tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be in the future that the
question of does this plant propagate well
[SPEAKER_01]: under tissue culture is actually a
criteria that we use for selecting
[SPEAKER_01]: individual plants, but currently we're not
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I can't think that we're too far off
from that, you know, with the increased
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in corporate ag and everything
and these like crazy huge fields they've
[SPEAKER_00]: got in California now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to think that's the future as
much as it may not be my flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well the more, listen, the more we
move towards scientists being involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: the selection of plants, these added
characteristics are going to start being
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with handing it all over to
scientists is they just don't get the
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have to, it's kind of like,
you know, if you're making wine,
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that make the best wine in the
world, like they consume wine,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they understand the things,
they understand the processes that go into
[SPEAKER_01]: production that yield quality at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the scientists start at that
point with cannabis where they really,
[SPEAKER_01]: the vast majority of the pure scientists
that are being brought in to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the most successful companies that
I see operating in cannabis space,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a science team or a group of
people that are bringing science to the
[SPEAKER_01]: venture, but they're also people from the
cannabis community that understand all the
[SPEAKER_01]: important things that go along with,
you know, cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really the marriage of those two
things that makes the win, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't really want a scientist who
has been over in ornamentals, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: making plants for somebody's frickin'
landscaping to be making these choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want Mean Gene to be making those
choices, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who I respect because they have
done the propagation and the sifting in
[SPEAKER_00]: the old ways, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want somebody like that, but with this
ridiculous science education to be making
[SPEAKER_00]: those choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I don't know, maybe there's
a handful of those people nowadays,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would guess that those are probably
these frickin' lucky kids who are in their
[SPEAKER_00]: early 20s now who are coming up in this
post-prohibition environment who are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn that stuff and they're gonna come
up and they're pot smokers who also are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting science degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, you know, I see plant breeding
or plant improvements as, really,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not a one-man sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a team sport, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of one of those situations
where it's like it takes teamwork to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the dream work, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it's a cheesy thing,
but it's like if you could pair,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Mean Gene with a really high
advanced plant scientist that understands
[SPEAKER_01]: things about plants that maybe Mean Gene
doesn't understand or someone like myself
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't understand, that you can actually,
you know, get a lot farther of the synergy
[SPEAKER_01]: between the experience, those two
different worlds of experience meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: together or being married together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can already start to imagine the teams
that I want to put together now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we should probably take our
first commercial break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is cannabis geneticist
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the national hemp program influx due
to stringent THC testing requirements,
[SPEAKER_00]: brothers Seth and Eric Crawford continue
to release seeds to hemp farmers that will
[SPEAKER_00]: be legal, no matter how you grow them or
when you test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These new varieties from Oregon CBD seeds
have substantial amounts of CBDV,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGV, CBCV, and THCV while always staying
below the 0.3% THC limit and guaranteeing
[SPEAKER_00]: complying crops for farmers every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, these new varieties cannot be
pollinated by your neighbor's uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen or a rogue male in your own crop
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD seeds are non-GMO certified
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD seeds was founded and funded in
2015 by Seth and Eric, maxing out their
[SPEAKER_00]: personal credit cards without outside
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continue to refuse outside investment
that would change their company culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD grows tons of fresh food on
their research farms for local food banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally tons of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also give away tens of thousands of
pounds of R&D flour to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: As their company began to succeed,
Seth and Eric started donating money to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause
too by giving millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon State University in order to
establish the world's leading cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics research program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they treat their employees right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD pays for full health and dental
coverage for their employees, a 401K
[SPEAKER_00]: program, and their minimum starting wage
is 20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus everyone shares food from the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth has been on Shaping Fire a few times
to talk about novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check out episodes 25 and 37 on
CBD cultivars in the hemp market,
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 66 on Triploid Cannabis Genetics,
and the very first Shaping Fire Live
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 47 with Seth and soil expert Jeff
Lowenfels talking about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a hemp farmer and you want to
grow reliable seeds that are sure to
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive in past testing, check out
oregoncbdseeds.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: buying seeds for the 2021 season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's oregoncbdseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficient dissolved oxygen in the root
zone is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaia's brand of ultra fine nanobubble
systems will help your garden thrive in
[SPEAKER_00]: ways you may not have considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter if you grow in soil,
hydroponics or aquaponics, Gaia's ultra
[SPEAKER_00]: fine nanobubble systems will increase your
dissolved oxygen and increase your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, the first sign of inadequate oxygen
supply to the roots is wilting of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant under warm conditions and high light
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insufficient oxygen results in an
accumulation of toxins and an insufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of water and mineral absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: If oxygen starvation continues,
mineral deficiencies will begin to show,
[SPEAKER_00]: roots die back, and plants will become
stunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy roots supplied with sufficient
oxygen are able to absorb nutrient ions
[SPEAKER_00]: selectively from the surrounding soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In studies, this has shown a 30% increase
in plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do ultra fine oxygen bubbles
allow your plants to thrive, but they will
[SPEAKER_00]: keep your drip lines and irrigation pipes
and plumbing clean, too, because algae,
[SPEAKER_00]: pythium and other invasive species only
survive in low oxygen environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Gaia system only costs about $2
per day to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaia ultra fine oxygen nanobubblers are
also great for making compost teas and
[SPEAKER_00]: wild crafts.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry, and today many
cannabis cultivators are moving from
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays and chemicals to beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert Biological Systems has the
beneficial insects, mites and nematodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbials, sticky cards and air
distribution units you need to partner
[SPEAKER_00]: with nature to defend your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_00]: from chemical sprays towards clean and
natural solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1967, Copert has assisted growers in

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, you are listening to Shaping
Fire, I am your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is cannabis
geneticist, Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have selected our mother plant,
we have harvested plantlets, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: incubated and multiplied them in the agar
growing medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about transitioning them to the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we move the plants from the
growing solution in these petri dishes to
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting into soil and becoming plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should probably walk through
the whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already started the process,
but there's different phases in tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we start with our X plant,
which is the piece of the plant that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: cut off, which is then sterilized and
initiated into the tissue culture process
[SPEAKER_01]: or into the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant then grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about already the process of
multiplying it and subculturing those
[SPEAKER_01]: plant parts again into their own
individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jars and that process kind of goes on over
and over and over again until,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, we have our army.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that point in time, we still have a
tiny little plant shoot in an agar medium
[SPEAKER_01]: in the jar with no roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to take that plant outside and
either try to clone it or try to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: stick it into soil, it would just die
because again, it needs to have that set
[SPEAKER_01]: of roots on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so depending on the hormone mixture
that we're using in the agar, we might
[SPEAKER_01]: have to create a new specific mixture or a
new specific rooting medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which we plug those, just like we do
with clones, we plug those little pieces,
[SPEAKER_01]: those little plant shoots into the rooting
medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the process of, say, seven to 14
days, just like a clone, these things will
[SPEAKER_01]: grow roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that little plant part is used
to being, and it's like happy little jar
[SPEAKER_01]: sterile greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't built up the type of protections
that it would need to just be taken and
[SPEAKER_01]: put it under like a thousand watt light or
in a greenhouse or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant would just wilt and die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have this process where we take
the rooted plants out, we wash away the
[SPEAKER_01]: agar medium, and we put them into soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of go through this real
babying phase, which we call hardening
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might think of it like the nursery in
the hospital where the baby's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go right when they're born.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a happy, warm little
environment with just the right amount of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a funny idea that the nursery in
the hospital is hardening off the humans.
Yeah.
Maybe it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that happens when we
grow these plants in tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: they grow very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because they don't need a lot of
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pulling sugar from the agar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not harvesting it through
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not exposed to wind and all
these other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have plants have, when you grow
plants in a greenhouse or in a grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, you can actually tell on the
plant they've got something called the
[SPEAKER_01]: waxy cuticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that waxy cuticle is kind of like,
think of it like an anti-transpiration
[SPEAKER_01]: barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stops the plant from just losing all of
its water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to baby these plants in a
way and kind of encourage them to toughen
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enough to the point where we can actually
take them and put them into a tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, or sorry, into a standard
production environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it might be like a warm environment
with lots of humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the important thing to realize is
that they don't go from the jar to the
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have this intermediate step.
[SPEAKER_00]: This intermediate step, is this still
happening in the lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of in between the lab and the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's less sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not sterile, but it's also not
exposed to the elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I said, it's like a nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly what it is, a nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we want to take these little
babies and encourage them to grow up just
[SPEAKER_01]: enough so that when we then take those
plants and move them into the production
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, either in a grow room or in a
greenhouse, that they can just take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big are they physically at this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really to do with size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can do it on very small
plants, but you kind of want to do it on
[SPEAKER_01]: what we, you know, stage like three and a
half, four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, you know, maybe three,
four inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that Petri dish, a plant has grown
that's about three or four inches long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the size of the plant you're
going to take out of the Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put into your soil in this nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the later phases of the tissue culture
process, I mean, we, we might start with
[SPEAKER_01]: baby jars or actually even test tubes,
but, but you can actually upscale the size
[SPEAKER_01]: of the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they use like those, I don't know,
they're like, you know, 500 gram yogurt
[SPEAKER_01]: containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably seen them at like fast or
not fast food takeouts, but like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe like a slightly higher end,
you know, vegetarian takeout.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a clear, clear polypropylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're actually like, like
transplanting, they're potting them up
[SPEAKER_00]: even in micro propagation in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As they get too, you know, if you're
growing these little trees, they literally
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like a two foot tall bush,
but it all happens in the size of a baby
[SPEAKER_01]: jar, a baby food jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you want to get, if you want the
plant to grow past that size, you make a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why these tissue culture vessels
come in various sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk one more moment about this
waxy cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the waxy cuticle, if I understand it
correctly, it is preserving like the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in the plant and is, is kind of
just kind of protecting it during the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardening off process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the waxy cuticle go away during the
hardening off process?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it like reabsorbed into the plant
or does it like fall off and is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I maybe wasn't clear when I said that the
waxy cuticle is what develops in this
[SPEAKER_01]: hardening off process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually growing more thick during
the, or thicker during the hardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so it's like the outer layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, the outside skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the skin is toughening up during the
hardening off process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, there's actually a product
that used to be able to buy that people
[SPEAKER_01]: would take.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was called no wilt,
but it was a, it was a product that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could actually put on cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of like a waxy spray that
you'd spray on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, it kind of seals the plant up and
it stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things, I mean,
when we, when we take a cutting off of a
[SPEAKER_01]: branch, cutting off of a plant,
you've cut off the way that the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get access to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why we use a dome on the
clone trays, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, it maintains that humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to take the dome off and put a,
even a fan blowing lightly across clones
[SPEAKER_01]: that were fresh actually planted,
they'd all wilt because what you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: is you're encouraging them to transpire
all that water out of the plant and they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't reabsorb enough water to compensate
for what they're losing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is that we kind of create
this little mini greenhouse with these
[SPEAKER_01]: domes and that prevents them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It holds the water in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It prevents them from transpiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, this, the waxy cuticle that's
going to grow on the outside, this
[SPEAKER_00]: actually reminds me a lot of wax grafting
tape that, you know, after, after you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you make a graft, you, you wrap it with
this waxy tape that is semi permeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but so it closes off the,
the, the cutting spot for two disease and
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminds me of the same thing,
how, how wax is protect generally
[SPEAKER_00]: protective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we, we know that these waxes
are all in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know if you've ever seen
these big CO2 extractors in the process,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, they actually pull out a
large amount of wax in the, in a CO2 run,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is usually why they do that
winterization step, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the extraction process where they,
they take the cannabis oil and they put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a big vat of or a big container of
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they drop the temperature really,
really low, like well below freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is all the waxes in the
extract, they precipitate out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution and you can actually filter the
waxes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those waxes though are coming from the
trichomes and not the plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's, you know, it's,
it's common in the literature to read that
[SPEAKER_00]: micropropagation produces plants that can
be more robust than their traditionally
[SPEAKER_00]: cloned counterparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has this been your experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably what we're seeing I don't
know if they would be any more robust than
[SPEAKER_01]: a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that probably what we're seeing is
that some of the plants that are coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of tissue culture compared to the
plants that they came from, they might be
[SPEAKER_01]: a little more vigorous, but it's probably
because the plants that we're comparing
[SPEAKER_01]: them to have had more, you know,
they've, I think we're talking about like
[SPEAKER_01]: dutted plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard of these dutted plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a viral, or bacterial load.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the plant has essentially become
infected over years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta again remember, cannabis plants
are annuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their natural life cycle is to grow and
live for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they set seed and the whole life
cycle starts again, which is kind of a way
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant to shed any bacteria that's
growing, that's growing in the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're, if you're growing a 1996
Jack Herrera plant, chances are it's
[SPEAKER_00]: picked up some garbage along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's actually one of the
things that we're seeing in tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: is that, you know, there's, we've seen
some groups identify like bacteria that
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually living within the cells of
the plant or in between the cells of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of, one of the things that you
can do in tissue culture is play around
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to actually find a way to kill
those bacteria and viruses in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of it being, oh, tissue culture
plants, are by definition, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: better and more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really like, yeah, it's really about
the fact that the preparation that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into creating a tissue culture mother,
you're cleaning up the bacteria and the
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so you're just making a better plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily that plants that are
grown in Petri dishes are somehow more
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I suspect that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I don't, I can't say that with 100%
confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the truth is also is that,
you know, while, while yeah, some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are starting to do tissue
culture in cannabis, I would say that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're probably three to five years away or
maybe even 10 years away from having a
[SPEAKER_01]: completely bulletproof system that is
producing perfect plants every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the category of bulletproof,
you know, one of the things that people
[SPEAKER_00]: who want to complain about tissue culture
will, they'll point out that some culture
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars do not grow true to type after
they're grown out from tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a failed expression common in
cannabis, like the plant, or is this more
[SPEAKER_00]: or less common in other species and,
and like what might cause this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's something called soma
clonal variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma clonal variation just means the
variation that we see due to possible
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic changes in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the tissue culture process and,
and we actually know that some of the home
[SPEAKER_01]: hormones that are used in the tissue
culture process actually do increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: rate of genetic mutation in these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might be seeing genetic changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could also be that we're seeing
epigenetic changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Epigenetics is essentially, you know,
it's a way that genes are regulated by the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a plant or an organism might go
through some organic or some environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: insult that changes the way that the DNA,
that their genes are expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this like nature versus nurture from
high school biology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's, it has, it has to do
with that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's, let's hit on that a little
bit more then, because I find this
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you just say that like,
you know, I mean, I know people are you
[SPEAKER_00]: use the term epigenetics a lot and you
know, one of my favorite breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: modern epigenetics is making cannabis
seeds, but you know, the word epigenetics
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not like super intimate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you suggesting that environmental
stresses can change the DNA?
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they change the way the DNA is
expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, like there's something called
DNA methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's these little tags that can
be put on a DNA, which say transcribe this
[SPEAKER_01]: gene or don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the DNA itself doesn't really change,
but it's what's being altered is the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation of those genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so epigenetics literally means above
genetics or standing upon genetics is
[SPEAKER_01]: really what epigenetics means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a type of regulation that
occurs on the DNA, without changing the
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so it's kind of like, all right,
the DNA says do this, but then there's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, then there's like an epigenetic
post-it note next to it that says,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, do that, but like, don't,
don't do that a lot or, or yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, but do that a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, without getting into a whole show
on epigenetics, I think that that's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I think the post-it note is actually
like a really good way to just think about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your little piece of machinery
that comes along and it reads the DNA and
[SPEAKER_01]: it encounters the post-it note.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that post-it note is an, is a little
instruction that says, Hey, read this DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the, the, the message that's on the
post-it notes, would that be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: somoclonal variation?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, somoclonal variation is the,
it's like the change in the observable,
[SPEAKER_01]: observable phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how I would describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the somoclonal variation is the
variation from the nurture, not the
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the off type.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I said, it's the way we put
known genetics in and 2% of those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that come back out look different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are somoclonal variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like, you know, getting,
getting, if I, if I get genetics up here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Pacific Northwest that grow totally
kick ass and humbled and I bring it here
[SPEAKER_00]: and people are like, Oh, that's not that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell by the photograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, well, you know,
I got it from Jodri and it's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: from humble, but our weather here sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm experiencing somoclonal
variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's, yeah, that's really
environmental differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went a little too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, it's really the variation that
we see coming out of the tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't, I wouldn't try to extrapolate,
extrapolate it past that, but we do know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, there's a, there's one
chemical that was really used a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, in, in cannabis tissue culture called
thigh diaziron or TDZ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And TDZ is known to cause genetic
mutations, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least to increase the frequency of
genetic mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by using some of these hormones in
the process, yeah, we can lead to changes,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There can be changes in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's really part of what we
want to do is monitor these, these types
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we can make sure that as we're
cloning, you know, you don't want to take
[SPEAKER_01]: a variant or an off type and then use that
to start your whole new subculturing
[SPEAKER_01]: process because everything that,
every plant that comes from that cell line
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is that we want to be,
have them being true to type AKA blue
[SPEAKER_01]: dream or whatever the variety is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want, you want to use the plant that
is true with the truest expression of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a great place for me to
ask you about genetic drift because oh my
[SPEAKER_00]: God, all the crazy stuff that is said
about genetic drift and people pointing
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers and like, you know, all the bro
science, God help us, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people argue a lot about whether or not
genetic drift is even a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, generally people are,
when they talk about genetic drift,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, okay, you had a mother some
time ago, let's say for the sake of this
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation, let's say that it was five
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this great plant and then you
made a clone off that mother and you grew
[SPEAKER_00]: that up and then you made a clone off that
plant and then you made a clone off that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like now maybe we're like seven or
eight or nine clones off of the original
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that was grown from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you know what people normally
tell me is like, oh, there's genetic drift
[SPEAKER_00]: because the cutting that you are growing
now nine cuttings later is so far from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the clone that you have now is
the same age as that mother was way back
[SPEAKER_00]: nine cuttings ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the, the, the genetics have drifted
from the original expression of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, what's, what's the,
what are the mechanics there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those are again, so those are why we
call off types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetic drift is actually something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetic drift really means the change in
the frequency of the genes in a population
[SPEAKER_01]: from one generation to the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those typically the frequencies of
genes, if your population is large enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: your breeding population is large enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: The frequency of those genes don't really
change in the population unless we're
[SPEAKER_01]: exerting some type of selection pressure
like, you know, either through artificial
[SPEAKER_01]: selection by humans or pests or molds,
or if you use a small breeding population,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are the things that can really cause
a change in the genetic frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's probably different than what
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the community has started using
the wrong term.
[SPEAKER_01]: That term genetic drift already has a
specific meaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that what the community is
really talking about is more results of
[SPEAKER_01]: somiclonal variation or some type of
epigenetic regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's either happening on the plant or
the change in phenotype is being induced
[SPEAKER_01]: by something like the plant has acquired a
virus, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not, it's not really age related.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not time related.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because over time, your cuttings of
cuttings of cuttings are actually picking
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you know, diseases and viruses and
stuff and getting weaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's more likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have shown through the sequencing,
you know, that has been done in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years that that, you know, clones,
what we call clones, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you remember the phyllis
galaxy, but they used to have these clone
[SPEAKER_01]: groups, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what we're talking about
is like, you know, if two people,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you got one cutting from Jodri and
somebody else got the same cutting from
[SPEAKER_01]: him like 10 years ago and took it to the
East Coast, as those two plants are now,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're divergent branches on an
evolutionary tree, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they actually may go through little
bits of DNA mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's how Pinot Gris and Pinot
Blanc came about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those grape varieties actually
started as Pinot Noir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, somebody in a vineyard
in France, 300 years after they started
[SPEAKER_01]: growing Pinot Noir, found one group of
branch or one group of grapes that was
[SPEAKER_01]: like slightly gray colored and it was a
white grape, not a red grape anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just because that one branch
produced a mutation and the mutation was
[SPEAKER_01]: in the gene that was responsible for the
color of the pigment in the grape,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you actually take that,
if you cut that branch off and root it,
[SPEAKER_01]: genetically, except for that one mutation,
it's the same plant as the Pinot Noir,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has just acquired a mutation that
allows it or that has caused it to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly different phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, before we go to the commercial
break, let's talk about one of the risks
[SPEAKER_00]: that people talk about with this entire
process, because, you know, you take your
[SPEAKER_00]: original mother plant, shall we say,
and she is the best expression of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that you want to micropropagate
to make your cannabis clone army.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you, you know, go through the
process of tissue culture to
[SPEAKER_00]: micropropagate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got, you know, a gazillion
of these plants and you're going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,000 of them out in a field or,
you know, in a series of warehouses or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things that I like
about growing outdoors from seed is that
[SPEAKER_00]: all of my plants are slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I get a pest, if I get crappy
weather, if I get a fungus, if I get like
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever my threat is, not all of my
plants are going to be equally susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, okay, I might lose some of my
plants, but I'm not going to lose all of
[SPEAKER_00]: my plants because they're like slightly
different people, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do this micropropagation though,
since you're targeting on this very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific expression of the genetics,
you know, these 5,000 plantlets that
[SPEAKER_00]: become plants, they're all going to be
exactly the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I agree with a lot of folks
that like, you're like, okay, well that
[SPEAKER_00]: might give you a whole bunch of plants
that will produce flowers that will look
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate in the same bag because they
look the same, but it also makes them
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible as hell to all of these pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think that that would
decrease the defensive posture of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants, making your plant,
your field or warehouse more at risk to
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: How realistic is that concern and how do
we weigh that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's, you're talking about
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is always the risk of monoculture,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you grow one genotype in an
environment, the possibility always exists
[SPEAKER_01]: that a pest is going to come in and really
love the plant that you're growing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's the case, they'll run
through it like locusts, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they literally will spread the
whole way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of one of the negative
aspects that we have in the way that we
[SPEAKER_01]: grow cannabis currently as a monoculture
is that we're very susceptible to invasion
[SPEAKER_01]: of pests or even specific molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if something shows up,
it's going to run through the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really the only way to combat that is
to plant some level of heterogeneity or
[SPEAKER_01]: some level of genetic diversity that it
kind of acts as like a shield or a
[SPEAKER_01]: barrier, you know, to the mass expansion
of the pest, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a quarter of your production
space is a plant that spider mites,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, don't find very tasty,
you know, they're going to stay away from
[SPEAKER_01]: that one plant or that one genetic type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can actually kind of create
barriers throughout your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You create a mosaic of different patches
of genetics and you kind of set it up in a
[SPEAKER_01]: randomized way that they, you know,
you don't have all your blue dream in one
[SPEAKER_01]: area, for example, so that if it gets
contaminated, it's going to run through
[SPEAKER_01]: them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My follow up is really fricking specific,
so I hope I can get us all the way there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, so, so you said that we want to
decrease the risk of the monoculture by
[SPEAKER_00]: creating this mosaic with different
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my question is, is this mosaic of
different genetics, all cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, to use your example,
plant one is a blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then plant two would be skittles and
then plant three would be wedding cake or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then, and then like, you know,
plant five would be blue dream again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plants two, three, and four have
got different genetics and may not be as
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive to whatever the pester or
fungus is that's attacking plant one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you mean that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we talk a ton about polyculture on this
show because I'm a big fan of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, planting cannabis plants
alongside other plants like comfrey or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because those plants might might
attract the pests or repel the pests
[SPEAKER_00]: because of their terpene profile,
depending on the nature of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you saying that that, you know,
the better solution for monoculture as
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been talking about it now is to
produce, is to plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: five or more different types of cannabis
plants, but interweave them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you saying, no, no, no,
you can actually do a whole field of one
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of cannabis plant, but then we
want to solve it with all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: species of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for the context of this
discussion, I mean, it's more about
[SPEAKER_01]: planting different types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't intersperse them plant by
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not an efficient way to either
plant or grow or track, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: through production.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might do blocks of say, you know,
whatever, 20 by 20 or 100 by 100 of one
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you rotate your blocks,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In a completely integrated system I think
that we're going to start to see more
[SPEAKER_01]: farms, more small farms that aren't just
growing cannabis, that they're adding
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as a value added product to their
production of what they can grow on their
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they'll grow their blueberries and
their garlic or whatever flowers they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like a little bit of cannabis
that helps with the bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that the future of cannabis
being really integrated into more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: holistic system, a holistic production
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: One step less advanced though,
is even in a cannabis grow, is if you say
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing five varieties,
that you don't just have one big block of
[SPEAKER_01]: each of those five varieties, that you
have many blocks of those different
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties interspersed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, that idea of growing your
blueberries or whatever and then cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: around it was what I really thought we
were signing up for when we started going
[SPEAKER_00]: down this legalization path.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my head, cannabis was going to save the
family farm, you know, because you could
[SPEAKER_00]: take the sales pressure off of the
vegetables or the fruit that has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested at a very specific time and
brought to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much pressure on the family
farm for these smaller margin plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of like, oh, do a row of
your fruit tree and then a row of your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cannabis plant can make sure
that the mortgage is paid and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: make, you know, a good profit but at a
lower margin off of whatever your food
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is and we save the family farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, unfortunately, like no
states are encouraging that with their
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's, I think it's a
disappointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're allowing it a little bit up
here in Canada and I've seen a few smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: farms try to integrate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, they don't do it in a
professional enough way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you really, you know, growers know
what they're doing at this point in time
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think that as an industry,
we're still in the very nascent,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're in the nascent stage
where, you know, we're trying out big,
[SPEAKER_01]: large public companies and they're not
really working out because they just
[SPEAKER_01]: produce a bunch of garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to maintain that level of
quality when you scale it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there is gonna be a sweet
spot but, you know, the smaller family
[SPEAKER_01]: farms also need to learn how to integrate
that information in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually something that,
you know, Oregon and Southern Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: even Northern California, there's some
people that are really doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that it's gonna be a learned
experience that people need to learn how
[SPEAKER_01]: to integrate a good amount of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a small amount, I'm not talking like a
small amount but a reasonable amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of cannabis that they can grow,
they can maintain the level of care and
[SPEAKER_01]: attention that is required to produce a
crop of that level of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, you can't, in today's
market, you can't just produce a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: average bud and expect to get a decent
paycheck for it on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's just way too many people
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the stuff that gets turned into THC
distillate, you know, it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: matter what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, you're just going in for
that one compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kinda like, you know, farming for
high fructose corn sugar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that we all recognize that the
people that really consume cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: are passionate about cannabis,
those aren't the products that they wanna
[SPEAKER_01]: consume, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanna consume either really high
quality flowers or extracts made from
[SPEAKER_01]: really high quality flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the only time I've ever seen the
interplanning of real food crops and real
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality cannabis in the way,
the kinda ideal way that you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about is when I visited Happy Day Farms,
Casey and Amber down in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes so much work and they've only
got a few acres of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I know that they're a small
craft farm and they're probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in scaling up to, you know,
mega acreage levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what I would like to see,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where you have acres of beautiful,
beautiful cannabis plants alongside
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful food and we can feed everybody
and get stoned at the same time while
[SPEAKER_00]: resisting pests and viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think we're there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I don't think the small farmers
are there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, running a farm, even a couple
acres of any crop, there's a lot of work
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some crops are more forgiving than
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think that cannabis is very
forgiving in terms of, it's like you said
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, like when it needs to be
harvested, it needs to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can't just put it off a week
or cut it a week earlier and expect that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna maintain that same level of
quality, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's hard to juggle those acre
size balls in the air and keep everything
[SPEAKER_01]: humming, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're gonna go to
commercial, but stay with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we come back, we're gonna start
talking about the other aspects of tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already covered micropropagation
very seriously, but there are a good five
[SPEAKER_00]: or six other things that are included with
tissue culture, and we're gonna do that
[SPEAKER_00]: after the break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is cannabis geneticist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the topics I wanna share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has follow-up
posts to Shaping Fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: my successes and failures in my own
garden, insights and best practices from
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grows everywhere, and always
gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_00]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: loyalty in the customers you already have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and you're not ready to hire somebody
full-time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Blunt Branding, Kirsten Nelson and her
team are focused on improving your bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_00]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is she well-reversed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals in Humboldt at
[SPEAKER_00]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_00]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: on results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every single friend I have
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a pen and paper, because the website
address is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_00]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_00]: while using cutting-edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this easy, automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_00]: After you've caught up on the latest
Shaping Fire episodes, do you sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: wish there was more cannabis education
available to learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire has a fabulous YouTube
channel with content not found on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I attend conventions to speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Zoe
[SPEAKER_00]: Sigmund's lecture, Understanding Your
Endocannabinoid System, Kevin Jodry of
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderland Nursery talking about breeding
cannabis for the best terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: Frenchy Kanoli's Lost Art of the Hashishin
presentation, Nicholas Mahmoud on
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative and polyculture cannabis
growing, Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis medicine around the world,
Eric Vlosky and Josh Rutherford on
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless extraction, and Jeff Lowenfels
on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system too.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there, be sure to check out the
three 10-part Shaping Fire session series,
[SPEAKER_00]: one with Kevin Jodry, one with Dr. Ethan
Russo, and one with Jeff Lowenfels,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even my own presentations on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of today, there's over 200 videos that
you can check out for free.

[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is cannabis geneticist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have reviewed how tissue culture can
be with Josh Rutherford.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see how contaminated it might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well really it's something that we
probably want to do repeatedly and over,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, at different points throughout
the tissue culture process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really how we go about
certifying something as pest, fungus,
[SPEAKER_01]: or virus-free, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We test them, we prove that there's no,
that these organisms aren't in the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's how we certify them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to clarify how PCR does that,
PCR is a technique for multiplying
[SPEAKER_01]: specific genetic markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for example, you know, powdery
mildew has a genetic sequence that's
[SPEAKER_01]: unique to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do spider mites in every virus,
you know, COVID, we all know that the
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID, these COVID plants can be
identified through specific genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can kind of do the same thing with
like the hops latent, Veroid, or any of
[SPEAKER_01]: these other viruses that are affecting
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can look for, we can look and try to
amplify these specific genes from those
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we don't show, if those,
if those pieces of DNA aren't amplified
[SPEAKER_01]: and we can't multiply them, then we can
say that those organisms are absent from
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, from the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like turning up the volume of a
song so that you can hear the
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumentation, but you turn it up and
you're like, yeah, I really don't hear a
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and so then you can certify it's
triangle-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a great analogy in fact,
because you know, those, those things are
[SPEAKER_01]: just a genetic single and that's what PCR
does is it amplifies that genetic signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if the signal is free, if we're
free from the signal, then we're also free
[SPEAKER_01]: from the organism that creates the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so after we've put this, these plants
into the PCR and we've turned up the
[SPEAKER_00]: volume so that we can hear all these
different signals very clearly and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we go like, oh, we hear the signal
for, I don't know, powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go into the plant and separate
the, these, these, these pollutants out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's, I'm not exactly sure how you
would do it with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd probably have to use a chemical that
suppresses powdery mildew, but let's
[SPEAKER_01]: consider- What's a better example then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's use a virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, like the, the hops late
in virus, for example, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when, when, when humans get infected by a
virus, one of the things that happens is
[SPEAKER_01]: we get a fever, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that you're body has
learned to give it, to, to raise your core
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature is that viruses or at least a
subset of viruses don't actually do very
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't replicate well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not very happy when the
temperature is higher than, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 37 degrees Celsius or whatever the ideal
human temperature is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So your body ramps up the temperature,
turns up the thermostat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get really hot and sweaty and,
you know, you maybe develop a fever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's actually giving your body's,
your body's creating a system where your
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system is going to be tougher than
the virus that it's fighting at that point
[SPEAKER_01]: in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll, it gives it a chance to kind of
take over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we apply that same logic to,
to plants, imagine as a plant cell is
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, you've got the meristem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the meristem is producing new
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: That new cell is initially born without
any viruses in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the virus moves in afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can actually grow a plant in
a raised temperature condition,
[SPEAKER_01]: as new cells are created, if the
temperature is high, the virus can't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually infect those cells because it's
at a disadvantage because the environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: the environmental temperature is high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might have a little section of
the plant where the whole tip of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes virus free because it's growing in
a high temperature environment and the
[SPEAKER_01]: virus aren't able to take over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you were able to go in at that
point and cut out the new healthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cells that hadn't been infected by a
virus and you subculture them and plant
[SPEAKER_01]: them on their own, you know, their own
agar plate, grow them for two to three
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, monitor them with a PCR test to see
if the virus is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it is, you just go through the
process again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after a series of subcultures,
theoretically you're able to get a group
[SPEAKER_01]: of cells that are true to the plant type,
but free from virus infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that plant, the plant that grows
from those cells, then becomes your new
[SPEAKER_01]: starting line, you've now actually removed
the viruses from your plant line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it all wrong, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I wasn't even close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I can see how novice or
amateur my picture was, but I was
[SPEAKER_00]: literally picturing the lab scientists
there with a scalpel cutting around the
[SPEAKER_00]: virus, you know, so that it's not in the
cutting, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way they're doing that, but it's just
that you're using the temperature to
[SPEAKER_01]: create the barrier for the virus,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way to do it, you might,
I mean, if it was a bacteria, you might
[SPEAKER_01]: put like antibiotics on the growth medium,
for example, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're creating a chemical situation in
the medium and thus in the plant where the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria can't grow, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go and you do the same thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you run it through the PCR and
you've turned up the volume and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see all the crap that your plants got,
then you create a strategy for like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, what are the different steps we're
going to do to this plant to allow new
[SPEAKER_00]: growth to be contaminant free?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, you know, you have to turn up
the heat for a while to get rid of a virus
[SPEAKER_00]: and then maybe you need to douse it with
some kind of, you know, organic chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: to get rid of something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like maybe, maybe it's a three or four
step process, but in the end you are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting new growth that is free of these
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and that's, you know,
what a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, hot blatant virus is also a
pain in the ass, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it completely devastates your
production space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, or broad mites or anything,
any of these types of pests that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get down to this very small little
world inside a jar where we add maybe just
[SPEAKER_01]: a very little bit of pesticide or
fungicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and those cells then grow out of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a lot different than having taken
a whole big tall plant and soaked it down
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, five liters of pesticide,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have to get that whole plant clean
when you're only trying to get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting to put in your Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's less environmental damage
because again, you've, you've released
[SPEAKER_01]: like maybe two, three micro liters worth
of pesticide as opposed to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 500 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier I thought you misspoke when you
said that we're, you're talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we were going to, you know,
remove from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we talked about the virus earlier
said spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you just said, I think you said
russets, but, um, like I thought that the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, these, these pests are coming from
the outside of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant attracts them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you telling me that there are things
within the plant that is making them
[SPEAKER_00]: either attract or more susceptible to
these plants, these pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically insects should be removed
during surface sterilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so that's really like the,
when we go through that sterilization part
[SPEAKER_01]: where before we put the plant into the jar
for the first time, you know, we might cut
[SPEAKER_01]: it, cut out a little stem section and,
you know, we use like bleach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you'll create like a 10,
15% bleach solution and just shake your
[SPEAKER_01]: little plant parts in the bleach for 15
seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's like really hard on the plant
material, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you, when you take it out,
there's all this dead plant material that
[SPEAKER_01]: you actually have to cut away before you,
um, you section out the part of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want to try to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what we're doing is we're
really, and they use all sorts of nasty
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they use like, you know,
mercury compounds and all sorts of little
[SPEAKER_01]: different poisons, um, to do that initial
sterilization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of one of the reasons you
don't want to keep reinitializing plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because you're always introducing
them into this chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, they go through a short chemical
insult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what comes out from that is your
starter culture material, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could find yourself in a situation
that a plant's got so much pollutant in it
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're like, man, I don't know if
it's going to be able to live through like
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five of these treatments to get
rid of all the crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I guess that's where the artisan
and expert level comes on where you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can expose a plant to these
various things and actually have it like
[SPEAKER_00]: living on the far side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have to have a strategy to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like again, you know, if a plant's really
weak and like really hurting, it's almost
[SPEAKER_01]: dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably not a great candidate
plant for tissue culture, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are certain forms of tissue culture
where you can do essentially what's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what's called rescue and you,
you can, you know, by shedding the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: the tips shoots of those plant from the
rest of the call it carcass, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The infected parts of the plant,
you're actually freeing it from that
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a targeted approach and it
has to be done with care and attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that with all the variabilities,
this next question isn't really fair,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to talk about cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this all sounds incredibly expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that, that you, you know,
let's say the, I don't know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: typical, but, but I'm just going to assume
for a second that a plant you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean up before you can micro propagate it
is going to have like, Oh, let's say that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a virus and a fungus in there
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, okay, we need to,
you know, we, we found these in the PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to clean these up so that we get a
nice clean cut so that we can micro
[SPEAKER_00]: propagate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to take us from the, the, the PCR
analysis through the cleaning it up so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have our one set of mother plants,
eight lids that were then going to micro
[SPEAKER_00]: propagate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, can you just give me a ballpark
figure about what it's going to cost to
[SPEAKER_00]: get us through the cleanup stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know what it would actually
cost in terms of reagent materials to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it yourself, but I know that there's
companies both in Canada and the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States that will, that will do this for
you now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard quotes from anywhere of
5,000 to $25,000 per, per genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you have a cutting of
blue dream and a cutting of cooking,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like a couple of little cookies
that you want to have this process done to
[SPEAKER_01]: its, you know, minimum 10 grand kind of
thing for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me a general idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can go up from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, again, if you're, if these people
are offering services to these public
[SPEAKER_01]: trading companies, it's gonna be closer to
25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then let's, let's bring this episode
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've spent the most of the show
talking about micro propagation because
[SPEAKER_00]: that is what 90% of those of the cannabis
industry is doing under this umbrella of
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that there's other cool stuff
that is under this tissue culture umbrella
[SPEAKER_00]: that's only being dabbled in cannabis
right now, even though it is incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: common with food and ornamental crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had mentioned in a previous answer
the issue of totipotency, the idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: plants have stem cells and these stem
cells can become any other part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using this knowledge, there are a few
other more rare tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: applications that we're not going to go
into deeply in this show, but anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's still listening, it probably
actually cares about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you go into a few of these
different applications that fall under the
[SPEAKER_00]: two tissue culture umbrella so that when
we end the show, people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, I understand the micropropagation
that makes up 90% of tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I also understand kind of topically or
tangentially these other areas that are
[SPEAKER_00]: also under the tissue culture umbrella.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, there's some really neat
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, tissue culture is just a great way
to kind of ship plants around the world
[SPEAKER_01]: and store them for long-term and we have
what we call ex situ storage of germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they might go into a forest and find a
very rare plant and then you can take a
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting of that plant and bring it back
and keep it alive under tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you people are smuggling plants that
way too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll get to that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the first really cool one that
I think that we're going to start seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: more of is something called a process
called cryopreservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so cryopreservation is exactly what it
sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, on the Futurama,
they had the frozen heads, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can take like a very small shoot
tip and you can subject it to a freezing
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you load the plant up with sugar
and these anti-osmotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever seen ice form under a
microscope, for example, you see what
[SPEAKER_01]: starts off as a clear liquid and then you
get these crystals growing in the liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: as it turns to ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you imagine that process happening
in a cell, those ice crystals will
[SPEAKER_01]: actually grow and they'll pierce right
through the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as you stab the cell wall with
like an ice crystal or a needle or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, the cell is done, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's going to leak all of its
contents out and it just can't take that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of insult.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do it properly, you can
actually get, you can do something called
[SPEAKER_01]: vitrification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas think of it like the life in that
cell going from an animated alive state to
[SPEAKER_01]: completely frozen into a glass like state
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just happens faster?
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens incredibly fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happens through a very specific
process of dropping the temperature in a
[SPEAKER_01]: very specific and quick way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can actually get that
vitrification to happen, think of it like
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to walk through the mud,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or walk through cement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got like rubber boots on up to your
knees and you're trying to walk through
[SPEAKER_01]: like some freshly laid cement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it gets stuck, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you got stuck in there and you
really tried to like really force moving
[SPEAKER_01]: your leg, like you might actually break
your leg, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you were frozen solid,
you're not going to break anything because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can actually get a cell or a
group of cells to undergo this
[SPEAKER_01]: vitrification process from essentially
live to completely frozen, like in a split
[SPEAKER_01]: second, that's called vitrification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that if you can actually
freeze life at that speed and size,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can then store whatever biological
materials you have at like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: minus 100 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: 120 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it in like a liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have these special containers that
hold liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And say the bottom third is filled up with
liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the top third is the gas that's coming
off that liquid nitrogen, which is still
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as cold as the liquid,
but that gaseous phase that fills up the
[SPEAKER_01]: top part of the container is cold enough
where you can actually store biological
[SPEAKER_01]: samples for, you know, an extended period
of time, say indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the temperature doesn't
change, those biological samples are safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can then take those things and
reanimate them and grow plantlets from
[SPEAKER_01]: those shoot tips that you've frozen under
cryopreservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a difficult process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've only just figured out how to do it
with cannabis, but it's been typically
[SPEAKER_01]: done in other species, you know,
pine trees and all sorts of trees that
[SPEAKER_01]: they use for forestry and hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a place in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hops Research Center is doing all this
kind of stuff with hops as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can imagine, I mean, anybody
that's a grower and collects, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: special plants from all over, you know,
you learn pretty quickly that it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, keeping 50 different genetic
types and having to like grow them and
[SPEAKER_01]: take cuttings and cycle them like that's a
real process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a lot of time and energy and
resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could just submit those things to a
frozen gene bag, knowing that you could
[SPEAKER_01]: then go and pull those plants out of
cryopreservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that process to pull them out of
cryopreservation, it takes like six
[SPEAKER_01]: months, right, until you've got a cutting
back in your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think of like the space saving
and the time saving and the resource
[SPEAKER_01]: saving that happens, if you can
cryopreserve these plants, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's something pretty special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, just keeping a regular
mother library is a big difficulty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my God, I can't imagine if you
were trying to take a snapshot of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: hype strains right now and like,
we're gonna preserve them all for the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you could preserve them all in
like a small 50 pound doer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the size of a propane barbecue
tank that you could probably store two or
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 cell lines in there, like no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a breeder, you know, if you're
doing selections, it's also very
attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an attractive thing to be able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next step, I think the next one I
think I mentioned is something a concept
[SPEAKER_01]: called artificial seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really like a very small shoot
tip, call it like, you know, three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: eighths of an inch, maybe half an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gets embedded into a little jelly
matrix and hardened in a solution of
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like a little mini tissue culture
shoot in a seed like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't look like a seed, it looks more
like a jelly bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those artificial seeds, again,
can generate a full plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can think about how easy it would
be to ship a small piece of plant material
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of a jelly bean around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, you get on a plane with
a handful of them in your pocket and you
[SPEAKER_01]: could pretty much go anywhere,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are another interesting little
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something called embryo rescue
that people might have read in the
[SPEAKER_01]: newspaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these Russian scientists found a
30 year old seed in a I'm not sure if it
[SPEAKER_01]: was an ice core.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was thawing out of a out of a melting
glacier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they collected these 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't mean 30 year old.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably mean more like 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, 30,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as soon as you said glacier,
I'm like, yeah, I think he means more than
[SPEAKER_00]: 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I misspoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, 30 30,000 year old season,
they actually were able to grow these
[SPEAKER_01]: things back in to into plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took some doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, this this idea of being able to
take seeds and baby the seed planting a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed is, you know, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you know, when you have a
30,000 year old seed, you really have to
[SPEAKER_01]: baby it and make sure all the conditions
are perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, tissue culture is kind of
one of those one of those ways that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't I can't even get seeds to pop from
1978.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let alone 30,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those are all possible candidates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, once a seed is dead,
it's dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's stored properly, you know,
sometimes you have like a lot of what the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed is, is it's part of the test is
actually just food source for the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you can plant the seed in the
ground and they'll grow to like two sets
[SPEAKER_01]: of leaves, all really eating the food
that's in in the seed already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never actually heard the term dead
seed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is actually do you mean from that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just based on what you were just
saying about food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean that the food that was
contained within the seed that keeps it
[SPEAKER_00]: virile has all been used and therefore you
have got genetic material with no food in
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed and that is therefore called a
dead seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really that it's used.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably that, you know, we're
talking about 30,000 year old seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be that the starches or whatever
the compounds or sugars that are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant have broken down due to whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a fungus or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, within a seed, there's a very
tiny little embryo, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that embryo could could
theoretically be cut out and provided with
[SPEAKER_01]: all the nutrients and vitamins that it's
need and hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: A typical, a typical cannabis seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that somebody has got their
typical scent, cannabis seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go old school and saved in a 35
millimeter film container, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's how they used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many years do you think that seed is
going to go before it's air quotes dead?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's, that's really a tough thing to
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you store a cannabis seed,
it's properly dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's packed with a desiccant, something
that's going to absorb the moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put those seeds into a fridge and
we're pulling seeds out that are like 25
[SPEAKER_01]: years old and still germinating at like
85, 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and listen, like I said earlier,
that also varies by type.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some genetic lines or they don't last
that long and some will probably last
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my personal hypothesis is that it has
something to do with the oil content
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in the seed before it goes through
that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever it is, it's just another
trait that varies, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That shows variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, the, the question about it
being in a container is really what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what was the temperature and what was the
humidity that those, that it was subject
[SPEAKER_01]: to, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like I said, if you, if you put it
in a four degrees Celsius fridge for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 20 years, they're going to be
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if it's in like, uh, a 35 millimeter
film camera in your attic, your attic or
[SPEAKER_01]: your trunk or your car or whatever,
like your odds are going to go way down
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty quick, which is probably why these
seeds that we're getting to pop after
[SPEAKER_00]: these thousands of years are coming out of
fricking tombs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in like a one environment that
was stable for that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's, so that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's also something called,
uh, answer culture, um, where we,
[SPEAKER_01]: we grow what you think about when a male
plant or a, even a feminized reverse
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, a plant, a female plant sprayed
with STS so that it's making male flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: those male flowers are, um, you know,
they go through a process until they drop
[SPEAKER_01]: the pollen and say that takes 30 days,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually cut those branches off
at like 15 days, for example, and go into
[SPEAKER_01]: the mid, the forming male flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within those flowers, there's the
cells that are growing to become pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually culture those cells at
that stage and, and try to culture them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in rare circumstances, um,
if you've done everything right,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can actually grow the pollen or the
pre pollen grain, grain cells into a
[SPEAKER_01]: plantlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we can subject those things to a
chemical called Colchicine and Colchicine
[SPEAKER_01]: is effectively doubles the chromosome
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can imagine that a pollen grain
like sperm or, you know, um, an egg in a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a female, in the female reproductive
system context of an egg, when those
[SPEAKER_01]: things come together, they actually in,
you know, in cannabis, when they come
[SPEAKER_01]: together, we get two sets of 10
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so each, the sperm and the egg only
have one copy of the 10 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's called haploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a, essentially you need to
have two halves to make the whole that
[SPEAKER_01]: when they come together in the new
organism, that that new organism has a
[SPEAKER_01]: complete genetic set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can grow these plants that have
half the set, double the chromosome
[SPEAKER_01]: number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've have a plant that is a
hundred percent true breeding for all
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's, those are called dihaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some mad scientist shit right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's serious mad science and stuff,
but this is, these are the techniques that
[SPEAKER_01]: they use in like corn and wheat breeding
to create seed lines where all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, you know, you can plant a hundred,
like a thousand acres and every single
[SPEAKER_01]: plant looks the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know anybody who's doing this in
cannabis now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's people, there's a couple of
groups that are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so this is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some hard, hardcore science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can, again, like, you know,
you can, if you can figure out the process
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow these pre pollen grains into
plantlets and you can say, get a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: of them, you can then go in and subject
those thousand plants to genetic screening
[SPEAKER_01]: and find the ones that are really ideal.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all really interesting future
stuff that's coming towards cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be, that'll really exceed our
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last real thing I think that's,
that's probably interesting to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: is the concept of somatic embryogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so embryogenesis is like, you can
think of the word, the genesis of an
[SPEAKER_01]: embryo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the process of creating embryos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the somatic part of that word means
it comes from the body of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can actually take, imagine you
could take, for example, your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, doesn't matter what it is called,
Skittles, you take your Skittles plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you encourage those, that plant to grow
callus and that callus can then be coaxed
[SPEAKER_01]: into like a pre embryonic cell state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, once we have those cells,
those cells can be grown and multiplied on
[SPEAKER_01]: mass quantities and then divided into
little groups or clumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those individual clumps can then be
coaxed into embryos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so essentially what you have at the
end of that process is say 10,000 embryos
[SPEAKER_01]: that all came from your Skittles plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're what we call bipolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a, a top shoot that goes like a
top meristem that grows skyward and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have the root meristem that grows towards
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in the context of the tissue
cultures that we were talking before,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we had to actually put them
through a separate process to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: root meristem to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were really unipolar at that
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were only growing skyward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having a plant part that will grow
a shoot and a root, it really makes things
[SPEAKER_01]: easy for automation because the plant's
ready to just do what it does normally as
[SPEAKER_01]: if it were a normal seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think of it like having a hundred
thousand seeds that are all twins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and do they have the virility that,
you know, like when we, when we normally
[SPEAKER_00]: say we're going to grow from seeds,
most people say like, yeah, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, a plant from a seed is going to be
more energetic and more virile than a
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these going to have that, that oomph
that you get from a seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, part of that comes from the
having the taproot that grows straight
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it taps down into the soil and goes
searching for the water table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas clones, you know, when we have
clones, they're coming out sideways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the roots kind of, they don't tap,
they don't, they don't seem to tap down as
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of, they kind of grow more along
the surface of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there really is something about
having that tap root that drives straight
[SPEAKER_01]: down into the soil that has to do with
vigor.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm kind of glad that we focused
on micro propagation as the major
[SPEAKER_00]: umbrella, because I don't think I would
have been able to follow you in a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with these five things that
you just laid out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like some serious science and I
don't, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some good people that have got
capital that are probably doing these
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but this really sounds like,
like mega ag, you know, mega ag companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll be doing this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably, I mean, you know,
someone like Mr. Mean Green, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: he could go and do this with a university
lab and partner with someone like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, there are definitely ways to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like you interjecting hope in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we, you know, none of this stuff is
beyond the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we've kind of felt,
you know, especially in growing out of
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition, that it's always been like us
versus these big corporations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there are, there are opportunities for
people to go, you know, it's rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: being acquired by those guys, why not go
and find ways that we can partner with
[SPEAKER_01]: them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like it's, it's more of an
equal relationship, not one of being told
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're going to do and when,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, Hey, look, we have all these
unique genetic resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we partner with people that have
knowledge of how to do these techniques so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can advance the species?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your, you ending this on a,
on a good note, this idea of, of
[SPEAKER_00]: partnering with scientists and
laboratories where we're on equal footing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, pleases me extensively more than the
idea of this idea of, of us having to
[SPEAKER_00]: defend ourselves because big ag is just
going to come and steal all of our good
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this idea of, of we who've been in
the scene for 10 or 20 years or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we just go directly to scientists who,
who smoke weed and say, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get together and let's, let's use
your, let's use your academic knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and then, you know, um, our ability to
smell flowers and determine terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles that cause joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's work together and,
you know, do it ourselves before the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics get taken and patented by
somebody who doesn't have our best
[SPEAKER_00]: interests at heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we, it's all in our hands to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, being able to
envision a way to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that as we move into this more
legal world, there is a lot of opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: for collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truth is these scientists,
they're not, I think the most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are really truly interested in
the science, they're not out to get rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out to change the world through
breeding plants and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: making these species into things that are
really valuable tools for humans.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, the somatic embryo
genesis is maybe it's a little more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: dream, but the dihaploid breeding and
using, um, anthraculture, these things
[SPEAKER_01]: are, they're standard methods that are
used in other crop species, other major
[SPEAKER_01]: crop species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, there's no reason we can't
use those same technologies in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a really positive note for us
to end on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan, thank you so much for sharing,
uh, your, your vast experience and your
[SPEAKER_00]: time and your friendship with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, your, your, um, the reaction
to your, your last visit with us was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like so positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all these positive or these private
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you had chimeras.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you are, um, you are a
unique person in our scene and I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate your, your willingness and your
ability to explain some of these really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard ideas in layman's terms so that the
rest of us can follow along with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate your, your, your interest
and your willingness to join me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you giving me the venue to
share the knowledge so that it works for
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks to all your listeners and I
hope someone puts this info to good use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to either like,
you know, reach out to Ryan Lee himself,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you just want to keep up on what
he's doing, uh, the best place to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: is on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is at breeding cannabis and,
uh, that's a good place to follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you want to hear more from Ryan
Lee, um, I recommend that you check out
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 64 of shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we did this beautiful show on
feminized seeds and female only breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, which, uh, was not only very
informative, but, um, it caused a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of mind blowing and argumentation in
the threads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's very interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should definitely check out episode
64.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is enlightening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, uh, the other place I'm
going to mention is, uh, the Emerald cup
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was there and recorded a great panel
that was titled analytical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh my God, what a panel this was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, uh, Ryan Lee, who's our guest
today, Seth Crawford from Oregon CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, plant, uh, uh, patent guru Reggie
Gaudino, Josh Wirtzer from SC labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was moderated from,
uh, by Jeremy plum from proof cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of, a bunch of folks who really
know their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And came together to talk serious,
uh, science and trash, uh, at Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: comp, uh, 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can, uh, you can check that out on
