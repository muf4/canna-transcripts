[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you again for you all for
being here for our first, I guess we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: call this a panel today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to introduce two of my,
I would say that you are both now friends
[SPEAKER_02]: more than just guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: To my right, we have Dr. Karuna Chowri,
who is Director of Plant Microbe
[SPEAKER_02]: Interactions at Mammoth Microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first heard her speak and then
I heard her title, I was all like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to learn everything you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so have been interviewing her every
chance I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: To her left is also a good friend,
Joshua Steensland.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a longtime cultivator and now
international cultivating consultant all
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout Canada and the Caribbean now,
but he's an Oregon boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of you probably know him as a
local.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how we're going to go about this is I'm
going to ask them a few questions about
[SPEAKER_02]: polyculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for anybody who's not familiar with
polyculture, it's very simply the idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: interplanting and companion planting with
your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're used to doing monoculture and
just having soil or hydro underneath our
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this idea is that we're going to plant
other plants with them for the better
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit of further everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this first question, I'm going to start
with Joshua if you would answer first and
[SPEAKER_02]: then Karuna if you want to pick up after
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our first question is, in what ways
does polyculture compare to companion
[SPEAKER_02]: planting benefit cannabis health that
monoculture does not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, I'm really, it's an honor to be
here and share the stage with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anyway, polyculture, what I've
noticed in my gardens is just kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard to quantify health benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really, we've noticed a lot less pest
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil health is more vibrant and the
plants really show that in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the finished product is just
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had cultivated conventionally for 15,
16 years previous to switching to living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and didn't even really think of it as
polyculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just companion planting and putting
things in to help retain soil moisture and
[SPEAKER_01]: add nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just noticed that at the end,
my plants looked incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the biggest selling point to
me is kind of the proofs in the pudding
[SPEAKER_01]: moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that you companion planted to
help with moisture retention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you break that out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, typically in regular garden
situations where you have bare soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're clearly going to be losing a lot of
moisture to the atmosphere and
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any way you can kind of lock in that
moisture is a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people do it with mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really common thing, straw or
barked chips or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really liked the idea of using live
plants that interact with the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_01]: and enrich the soil microbiology and
retain moisture at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of a win-win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've heard you describe it before is
like creating a little rainforest below
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just creating this smaller moisture
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Karuna, same thing to you since you
are approaching this less as a cultivator
[SPEAKER_02]: and more as a diehard plant scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see as the advantages from
polyculture versus a monoculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you talk about polyculture,
basically what you're doing is you're
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing many different kinds of plants
along with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're introducing here is diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all know, diversity is always
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: With monoculture, you are basically
providing the nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are providing moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are providing pest control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are doing everything on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have a polyculture,
you have all the different members in that
[SPEAKER_00]: farm or in that grow that take care of all
these different aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, you're going to be
hands-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that are grown in such diverse
environment are more healthy because they
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of get all the nutrients on demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all communicating with each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have spoken about this many times
before is beneath the ground, you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots and they are constantly
communicating with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is just monoculture, they are
only going to be talking one language.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are introducing many different kinds
of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they're going to be talking different
languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all capable of doing different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads to a plant which is more
healthy because it gets the right
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition at the right time, correct
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, these plants can fend off pests
better than what a monoculture can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, in all aspects, having a
polyculture is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like what you're describing is a
situation where when you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: monoculture, you only get the know-how of
the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're adding all these other types
of herbs, they all do their own jobs and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all providing different types of
foods to the microbes in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, what you've got is a greater
diversity of folks making short work of a
[SPEAKER_02]: complex array.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have seen few grows where they have
not introduced a different plant per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have different cultivars in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, some cultivars are susceptible to
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more efficient in nutrition
utilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those grows, I have seen that there
might be some plants that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: infested with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rest of the grow is completely
free of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here is a completely organic-style
farming just because you decided to go a
[SPEAKER_00]: polyculture way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than just grow one cultivar in a
grow facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Joshua, the two of you would be
attracted to companion planning and
[SPEAKER_02]: choosing of the plants in different ways,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Karuna might be coming at it from a
scientific level because she knows the
[SPEAKER_02]: specific botany of other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, over your multiple decades of
experience, have been choosing them more
[SPEAKER_02]: from your intuition, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm curious from both of you,
how best can all of us, from folks who are
[SPEAKER_02]: home-growing as patients in tents,
all the way up to folks who are watching
[SPEAKER_02]: who are scaling commercial, what's the
best way to go about choosing the specific
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that we're going to install into
our polyculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you went kind of my route,
which is just throw anything at the beds
[SPEAKER_01]: and see what happens, is what I've just
kind of done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have not been afraid to throw
anything in my beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I learn and as I observe,
and we're learning things like mustard and
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially broccoli, like when those
leaves break down, they could actually
[SPEAKER_01]: have a negative effect on the fungal
components in the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, once again, it speaks to diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just had all of those as your
companion plant, the mustard was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you're really setting yourself up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I just kind of throw things at the
beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever makes it, makes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever doesn't, doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the route I've taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far, so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to just experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like we've spoken on, diversity is the
key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if one thing out of the 12 or 13 or 20
things you have in your bed isn't working,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a nightmare on your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the one that you, the one companion
plant you mentioned was actually one that
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you easily just recommend three for
folks that if they just go and they plug
[SPEAKER_02]: into their soil is sure to be a win?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comfrey is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great dynamic accumulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you leave it in the beds and
allow the leaves to cycle the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: back in, it takes nutrients that were
previously unavailable to the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: rearranges them into a plant-available
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when those, when those leaves get
mulched back in, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible for your growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, definitely Comfrey is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the nitrogen fixers?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking a little bit about clover
and thrip pressure and all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, clover's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to do a whole lot of it or
just be prepared for thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But clover's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legumes are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen fixing things are really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I like Comfrey, clover,
nitrogen fixers, and ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grasses are really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a really good job at creating a
dense mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a really good job at that for that
moisture retention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they die off in cannabis,
you get a, during your two-month or
[SPEAKER_01]: three-month flowering cycle, depending on
what you got going, what's underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy will die off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lots of times that's, those are my
decisions on what stays.
[SPEAKER_01]: As if it just didn't make it through the
die-off, I'm not too concerned about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll replant something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to pinpoint one thing on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: For anybody who's been following
polyculture or may have heard Joshua on
[SPEAKER_02]: the Shaping Fire podcast, you know,
folks are talking about now that clover
[SPEAKER_02]: may not be the best because it attracts
thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, of course, really disappointed
me because that's what I used this year
[SPEAKER_02]: already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now I have to pull out all the
clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm hearing a slightly different
message from you today, which is clover is
[SPEAKER_02]: okay in very small moderation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So will you kind of clarify that for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I thought we were not using clover
at all anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think I was just mainly speaking
to the diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diversity part that if you had,
I think a little bit of clover is okay
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you're planting other diverse,
a diverse network of companion plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were just talking about this before
coming on, that that pest pressure that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be present from the clover can be
mitigated by the attraction of beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects from your other companion plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really up your ante by having that
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were all clover or 50% clover,
you're going to have a battle on your
[SPEAKER_01]: hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you have 5% clover,
you're still going to get nitrogen fixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still going to have diversity in
the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that pest pressure is
going to be less of an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Renai, I think that idea of don't put a
monocrop under your monocrop is a good
[SPEAKER_02]: idea, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever you're going to put under your
monocrop so it's not a monocrop,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that it's diverse so you have
polyculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Karuna, your approach is entirely
different, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You are thinking about what's going on in
the rhizosphere and targeting specific
[SPEAKER_02]: plants because of your botany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because you're involved with studies,
it's a lot more expensive for your
[SPEAKER_02]: mistakes or if you find something that
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you go about choosing plants
that you would want to do a polyculture
[SPEAKER_02]: with?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're trying to go with the
polyculture, you have to first decide what
[SPEAKER_00]: is it that you need the polyculture for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to plant things to get rid
of pests, to attract beneficial insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you just doing it for the nutrition
cycling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clover is an excellent example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very good at nitrogen cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, yes, it can repel
thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have high humidity,
it can actually introduce powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be aware of what is it that
you want to have in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most of the grow that we have,
it's indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pest pressure is low to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would basically look for anything
that can be helpful in nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the plants, like you have
alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have many of them that can cycle not
just nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can cycle calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can cycle sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have those kinds of plants in
your grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you are providing your NPK
fertilizer and other fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants are communicating with the
cannabis plants and providing what they
[SPEAKER_00]: need in proper amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is for nutrition cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to plant some marigolds,
it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will always get rid of all your other
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a really organic garden,
pest-free garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you want to plant depends on
exactly what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really have a lot of pests in your
area, you go for something that can get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of them, go for alfalfa, that can
attract ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take care of your spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just that mix and match,
the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clover is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, as a warning, if you are living
in a place where there is high humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, clover can attract powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to go for plants that are
a little bigger and not trapping much of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at what is native.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is another thing I should point out
is just because we say clover worked well
[SPEAKER_00]: or a particular plant worked well in
Portland, Oregon, does not mean it will
[SPEAKER_00]: work well in Fort Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it might work well in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will have to look around what plant
is present in your surroundings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for the native ones because they know
how to live, how to thrive in that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware of what you're looking
for in your polyculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that goes doubly so if you happen to
be using native soils, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as we know, microbes are
bioregional, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have different microbes
that are occurring in Colorado than we
[SPEAKER_02]: have here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so choosing companion plants that are
local will probably interact with the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes more successfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Kruna, you said that marigold is a
good example of something that will repel
[SPEAKER_02]: pests, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big fan of using beneficial insects,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so will the marigolds also repel my
beneficial insects and have them leave the
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhood?
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite often when you have these plants
that have got a lot of flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of pollen, they will attract many of
your predator bugs that can get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: your pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one reason being is that you need to
have plants which have got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have marigolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have gerbera daisies because they can
offer pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have your predator mites or
predator insects that can take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: your pest, what if you don't have pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys still need to feed on
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the source of protein for them then
becomes pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having these kind of flowering plants
in your grow is definitely beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can provide some sort of food
source to your predator bugs which are
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping your grow pest free.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more follow-up on that before we move
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were saying that, you know,
choose the particular plants that you want
[SPEAKER_02]: for particular jobs and then, you know,
determine how much pest pressure you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have and choose based on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there also plants that are negatively
allopathic instead of positively,
[SPEAKER_02]: like plants that we might choose as a
companion plant, which actually doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: play nice with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many plants, especially the ones
that kind of grow tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them because then they are
going to take away all the sunlight that
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis is supposed to relieve,
is to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely look for plants that are
shorter than your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't look for plants that require very
high maintenance, like if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they look nice, but you are spending
more time now supporting the rose than
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for plants that are low
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are shorter in growth compared to
your cannabis and that way you can assure
[SPEAKER_00]: that your plants are healthy, your
cannabis is getting all the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the focus on cannabis, not the
companion plants, but you need the
[SPEAKER_00]: companion plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that is a, it's really easy
to get distracted by your companion plants
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, I've had the cannabis
plants in my gardens for years,
[SPEAKER_02]: but now that there's companion plants,
not only is it more beautiful,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there are plants that I'm not as
familiar with, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we all know, growing cannabis is a
gateway to horticulture, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now that I'm growing my cannabis
plants and having some amount of success,
[SPEAKER_02]: now I'm all interested in these other
companion plants, which, which again,
[SPEAKER_02]: most everybody else is also calling weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like all the plants I'm
interested in are all weed one way or
[SPEAKER_02]: another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so one of the challenges with
polyculture and getting it adopted by
[SPEAKER_02]: people is people are like, like,
ah, it doesn't work for commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work for scaling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't, we can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes too much labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to get too much education.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I, I see Joshua's Instagram,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm seeing, you know, these,
these beautiful commercial rooms that are
[SPEAKER_02]: companion planted, kicking out these
fantastically yielding plants and flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Joshua, you know, tell us a little bit
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, help me dispel the myth
that polyculture is not for commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, I think there's,
we're battling kind of an old way of
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking when it comes to just agriculture
in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really, we're really fighting that
kind of monoculture mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so lots of people just don't really,
they don't really understand that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just as simple as what I described
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as simple as just throwing stuff in
there and seeing what works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at scale, it's, there's really
no, you're not really adding much labor
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're just scattering seed or
planting, you know, a plant here or there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and your observation doesn't really
change much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at scale, it's just, it's not an issue
we've found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the benefit of the healthier beds
and the healthier system in general is
[SPEAKER_01]: just worth that extra effort and maybe
worth some of the anxiety you might have
[SPEAKER_01]: with investors or if you're working for an
owner, that they might not understand
[SPEAKER_01]: those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're really, other common questions
are like, aren't they taking nutrients and
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't they robbing nutrients from the
soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of these things, people just
need to be reassured that, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's a process in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't really require a lot of
interaction on our part.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny that you would mention the,
you know, the investors or the owners,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's exactly where I was going
to go next.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, we probably have a lot
of cultivators in the room, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: folks who are just patients like me who
just have a few plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but I know that there are,
you know, you know, commercial cultivators
[SPEAKER_02]: in the room that are responsible for a lot
of lights, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, as a commercial cultivator
who has had to turn on your investors to
[SPEAKER_02]: this, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what do you recommend as being
the, the, the best argument to take to the
[SPEAKER_02]: owners on why they should do this radical
thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think fortunately I have a body of
work to reference from my home grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've, I've got several years,
I've got beds that are four years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have I have a little bit of a
reference point that I can, I can bring
[SPEAKER_01]: them product from my micro and,
and just really talk with them and get
[SPEAKER_01]: them comfortable with the idea that
there's a natural process at work here and
[SPEAKER_01]: that we really don't maybe not need to
necessarily fully understand it to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to implement it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of a scary statement to
say to people who have hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of dollars into a project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because, you know, just I have such
confidence in, in that natural order that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really, it's a really easy sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Karuna, I know that for you it is all
about analytics and spreadsheets,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you look with, with very close
awareness on, on what is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so from, from your perspective,
how do you, you know, explain to people
[SPEAKER_02]: how polyculture is increasing yields and,
and if there is more labor it's well worth
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something that comes to the
top of everybody's mind who wants to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: polyculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, are you not adding more
plants, which means that you need more
[SPEAKER_00]: water for irrigation, you need more,
you know, fertilizers added.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will go back and say first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing, you choose a plant that is
not going to be as demanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go local.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can thrive in your local environment
is something you go choosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, don't go plant roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are really demanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go for something that again classifies
as weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about dill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about marigold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about gerbera, daisies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kill lavender plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thrive, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want a plant which is not going to
be demanding on nutrition or your
[SPEAKER_00]: fertigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you get in return from all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these plants, they are going to be
cycling nutrients as per what your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants require.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you in long term are going to have
really healthy plants which have gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: the right amount of nutrients at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, by introducing all these
different plants, you're going to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the pests that you're thinking of,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So no more spider mites, no more any other
mites that are coming and troubling your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to use pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all are aware of the biggest problem
that pesticides pose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to introduce the audience to
that kind of problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have any pesticide use in
your grow, what you have is an organic bud
[SPEAKER_00]: and organic yield completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not going to be worrying about
this pest management or use of pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants in general are going to be
so healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen it with my eyes that you are
finally going to have a very good yield
[SPEAKER_00]: which is completely organic, pesticide
free, and it does not require as much
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition and irrigation as people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you're going to require that
much, you're doing something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back and take a look at, can you change
your companion plant and come back to a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant which is not as demanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've experienced that myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've just recently learned about
polyculture from Joshua actually when we
[SPEAKER_02]: did our podcast episode on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I decided, all right, let's do
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, of course, it gives you an excuse
to buy more seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And who doesn't love a seed catalog,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, I over sowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my companion plants were like,
you know, luckily the cannabis is taller.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm in good shape there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing that I noticed is being a
novice grower, as I still consider myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a tendency for my soil to go
hydrophobic, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of us have had the experience
where you're going to hand water and the
[SPEAKER_02]: water runs off the side of the pot and
down the end and out the hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, come on, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you companion plant,
there's all these new, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: entry points into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now when I water, it's not sliding down
the side and going down the side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually staying there, being held by
the other plants, and then soaking in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, that was the quickest
discovery I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my soil is so clearly healthier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you've both hit on something that I
hear all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: People say, all right, if I've got all
these companion plants, though,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're stealing nutrition from the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, there's two different ways
to address that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the actual soil amendments that
can be expensive that perhaps these plants
[SPEAKER_02]: are using.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, is it literally taking from
the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Corona, let's start with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you address the nutrition,
whether or not you actually have to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase it, and by how much?
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether do you have to increase
nutrition?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go to that question first right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me explain what goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so far we have been discussing what
goes on on the top when you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is visual?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are completely forgetting is there
is a whole ecosystem down there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each plant is quite capable of
attracting its own set of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it likes to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plant and microbes, they
communicate with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes are very good at fending off
root pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very good at solubilizing
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very good at providing enzymes and
other metabolites that boost plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't steal from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, they provide each other with
healthy nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have cannabis, which can attract
its own set of soil microbes in its
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's doing its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next plant, next to it,
has its own set of microbes that can
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a completely new set of
metabolites that is now available to your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, your cannabis
plant is going to benefit from having any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of diversity in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants don't steal from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually enrich each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very good case for having
diversity in your group rather than just
[SPEAKER_00]: having a monoculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you describe it, I want to move in
myself, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a community I want to be
a part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Joshua, same kind of question to you,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the science sounds believable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, it's all about when the
rubber hits the road, does this actually
[SPEAKER_02]: work?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you work every day in this kind of
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are your experiences with
nutrition and water and the potential from
[SPEAKER_02]: the companion plants to starve out the
cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: She pretty much nailed it, clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, what I would add is that a
properly amended soil or a properly
[SPEAKER_01]: amended garden is going to have plenty of
available nutrient for everything there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't think of, say, my beets as
taking nutrients from my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of the beets as taking nutrients
from the nutrient pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I'm not taking those things
out of the garden and leaving them and
[SPEAKER_01]: letting them cycle, then those nutrients
are kind of staying there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no subtraction happening,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you take time into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: So diversity, of course, is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that just leaving the things
in there to cycle those nutrients back,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to experience a loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I didn't understand at
first when I first planted my polyculture
[SPEAKER_02]: is that being brought up NPK and just dump
it on the plant and hope for the best,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you realize that there are huge
advantages to using a living soil and that
[SPEAKER_02]: we then choose to feed the soil instead of
the plant, I think it's pretty surprising
[SPEAKER_02]: to realize that the microbes that are
there that we're trying to support are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually making plant food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've found that I'm actually having to add
less amendments and top dress after the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact because it's once I've revved up this
engine, it's actually becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: self-replicating because the microbes are
doing their jobs once you kind of get the
[SPEAKER_02]: pump primed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Karuna, and I would like you to go into
the science part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go over my head, Elise, and speak to
the people who are more familiar with
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on at the microbial level
that is causing these microbes to excrete
[SPEAKER_02]: these foods that other microbes use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a snapshot of how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the plant grows, just in a single
24-hour cycle, the plant exudates are
[SPEAKER_00]: given up through its roots, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant, when it's doing its
photosynthesis, it's making food,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at nighttime, it is going to let those
exudate out from the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those exudates, we might think,
okay, it's an exudate, but that exudate is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually food for the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically saying here is the food,
and that food is so specific for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes that they get attracted,
and when they come to eat that food from
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant in exchange, they are going to
give the plant something which is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a metabolite which is going to boost
the growth in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very cyclic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have different group of microbes
doing different things throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one set of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have second set of microbes doing
the same thing with other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you're done with harvest,
you're saying, okay, now the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: already gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do these microbes do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't perish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they are going to do is they are
going to take the rest of the roots that
[SPEAKER_00]: are left there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to decompose it,
so they are going to take all the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, they're going to break it down,
and they don't get washed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next time when you're going to start
with your grow again, these nutrients are
[SPEAKER_00]: already available, and like you said,
over the period of time, you have to use
[SPEAKER_00]: less and less and less of added fertilizer
to get much better plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add less fertilizer, but you get much
more healthier plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having microbial diversity in the soil
is the key to having healthy grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the more different plants you have,
the more different microbes you have in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, and that will keep your grow
very healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic, and also that is a great time
to plug no-till, because as we've all
[SPEAKER_02]: realized, after you put all this effort
into infusing all of this life into soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're using less of your bottled
nutrients, hopefully less and less of them
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time, eventually you end up with
this beautiful living soil, and it smells
[SPEAKER_02]: good, and there's worms, and occasionally
you'll get mushrooms, and that's all
[SPEAKER_02]: great, but then we were all brought up to
get rid of your soil, sterilize the pots,
[SPEAKER_02]: and start with brand new soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Joshua, you are a big proponent of
no-till, and you've got these great indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: beds that you just plant on again more and
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you break out what your growing
cycle looks like when you are using
[SPEAKER_02]: no-till?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it is incredibly simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so simple that you feel guilty
accepting a praise at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really so simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have your beds nurtured in such a
way, you should be able to just plant your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in, adjust the life cycle,
and let it go, and we talked about this
[SPEAKER_01]: too, about just getting out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much happening that is
independent of our involvement once we
[SPEAKER_01]: insert the plant into a healthy living
soil that meddling it just brings
[SPEAKER_01]: variables, and variables, I try to avoid
them like the plague, and so I think
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil really enabled me to look at
my cultivation practices and eliminate
[SPEAKER_01]: just a myriad of these variables that I
was dealing with in the 15 or 16 years
[SPEAKER_01]: previous, so I think no-till is one of
those kind of buzzwords in the community
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, and for the most part people
understand it, but people really don't or
[SPEAKER_01]: are having trouble wrapping their head
around the fact that you really don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to do anything, that you've got to kind of
separate your ego and your kind of mad
[SPEAKER_01]: scientist self and just separate yourself
from it and let that process play itself
[SPEAKER_01]: out and just observe, and that's what
really has turned me on about no-till and
[SPEAKER_01]: why I've kind of become evangelical about
it is because it changed me in so many
[SPEAKER_01]: ways and my cultivation style and the
quality of medicine and the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: products that we've seen, even just the
quality of my produce at home when I
[SPEAKER_01]: switched my vegetable garden to a no-till
type regenerative system, it's hands down
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you nailed it too when you said
that it's one thing to understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: definition of no-till, but another thing
to believe it, because it definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds too good to be true, because the
labor savings is incredible, you're saving
[SPEAKER_02]: all this money on soil, and every time you
do a new cycle your soil's already primed
[SPEAKER_02]: and ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk real brass tacks here for a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got this no-till bed,
and you've just harvested your cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, and you've got some amount of
companion plants that are still going,
[SPEAKER_02]: what are you going to do next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically I want you to talk about root
balls and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spoke earlier about as the beds mature
you need to add less and less dry nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: and mineral content, and that's really
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now my beds at home are about four years
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only re-amend them twice a year,
every other cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's a re-amend period, I never
re-amend with my cash crop, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been wanting to illustrate that
cannabis can be grown with water only,
[SPEAKER_01]: with no other inputs, and you can get the
whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not sacrificing yields,
you're getting a better quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't do any kind of top dressing or
re-amending during that cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if it's an off cycle I won't even
re-amend I'll just harvest the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: cut the stock at the soil level,
and then just leave it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as she described earlier, it just gets
consumed by the soil biology, it cycles
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients that are locked up in the
roots, and I just plant the new crop right
[SPEAKER_01]: next to the old one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after about three cycles,
sometimes two, it's just completely gone,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's nothing left.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so strange to see an old cut plant in
the bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like, as somebody who likes to
keep really clean gardens, it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: heresy right there, that should be gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes a while to realize that
nature's not clean, and when we see tree
[SPEAKER_02]: trunks and decaying plant matter,
that's part of this whole cycle,
[SPEAKER_02]: whereas I have traditionally wanted to
clean it all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's well to your point where
a lot of polyculture, well heck gardening
[SPEAKER_02]: at all, is just getting our egos out of
the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this idea of adding companion plants is
fun, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm curious to hear from both of
you, how will the companion plants do in
[SPEAKER_02]: this environment as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because really the companion plants are
there to serve the rhizosphere and the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plant, but it'd be really cool if
they would bloom or maybe even produce
[SPEAKER_02]: food.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they going to work on an 18-6 or
so light cycle during veg that then gets
[SPEAKER_02]: shifted to 12-12?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know our favorite plant likes that,
but I'm sure that some of the companion
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how should we think about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you start, Karuna?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of very funny,
and I hear this question so many times
[SPEAKER_00]: about what will the companion plants do
12-12 cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis has been growing outside the
grow for as many years, as we all know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at any outdoor grow,
it doesn't happen that the plant decides,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, 12 hours, let's switch the light off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your companion plants are definitely
going to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is an outdoor grow cycle,
they will be perfectly fine, because it
[SPEAKER_00]: does not happen that the light is going to
be switched off, like what we do for
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the indoor grow, again, your focus is
on cannabis, not the companion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you switch the light, they might
take a little bit longer to bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe, and that's perfectly fine,
because your focus is the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: not your companion plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you want your Yerbera daisy to
bloom and you don't care about the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, that's a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we cater to that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at any point, you focus on your
cannabis plant, and the rest of your
[SPEAKER_00]: companion plants will definitely adapt,
and it will not be a big issue at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Joshua, I know that you've gone so
far as to intermingled food plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think it's great to be able to get
both smoke and food out of the same bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about efficiencies here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you talk a little bit about
that process, and how you chose the foods,
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe make some suggestions people
might want to try if they want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff out, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think when I decided to
introduce food into the polyculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was mainly to diversify what the soil
microbiology and the worms had access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to take much out of my beds for
that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like those nutrients to cycle back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my experience has been to really
not consume much of anything and just
[SPEAKER_01]: leave it to the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing it for the soil microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talking on the light cycle thing,
I've had one particular broccoli plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been in my beds for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's never flowered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just constantly in this vegetative
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking that that has something
to do with the light cycle, and maybe some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the diffused light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back to your question, I typically
don't grow food for my consumption in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically just to kind of have a
diverse array of things to go back into
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, companion planting food is
a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole lot easier if you're working
outdoors, too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nicholas Mahmood down at Green Source in
Wolf Creek, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's by far the person I've seen that's
done the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, under his companion plants,
you've got beds of straw.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then under those, he's got potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's got artichokes coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's amazing, because as he goes
through and gives you a tour of the farm,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's also pulling out lunch, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it makes for a really unique
experience, both reminding us that the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plant is a naturally occurring
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not have to be separate from
nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is of nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, especially when margins are so
tight here in Oregon, if you can also get
[SPEAKER_02]: lunch out of it, that's a win as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I really, I gotta say, I have the
deepest respect for Green Source Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are literally the tip of the spear
and a shining example of regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we all need to look to them as
that example and try to emulate it as much
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important, too,
I always say Green Source and Nicholas,
[SPEAKER_02]: because he's the guy that I interviewed,
but his wife Elizabeth deserves just as
[SPEAKER_02]: much credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their partnership together,
bouncing things off each other,
[SPEAKER_02]: both of them educating and then bringing
information back to each other and to
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse, who's also on the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real team effort, just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like polyculture, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Colonel, let's finish up with you on a
similar question.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the science side, if somebody did
want to companion plant food, what should
[SPEAKER_02]: they look for in a plant that's going to
thrive food-wise alongside cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as I said, when you're going for
your companion plant, focus should be
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, not food plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant something that is going to be
small and not going to be really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be planting big-style
tomatoes, you know, that require more
[SPEAKER_00]: care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant something that will be shorter
than cannabis plant, will not take so much
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you don't have to keep fertilizing
your companion plant rather than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those kind of, any plant that fits that
criteria and is quite local, can thrive in
[SPEAKER_00]: your local environment, go for that kind
of food plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're thinking lettuces, radishes,
what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have lettuce, radish, alfalfa,
of course, you don't eat alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that is a good one to have there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have dill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these herbs, they're very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they look nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very good pest repellents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also help with their shallow root
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can hold onto soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have less of erosion, less of
materials kind of just washing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other plants can I think of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mint is a very good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mint will also repel so many other pests
that are present in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are so many herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbs is something that you can never go
wrong with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the first thing that you go
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he does a lot of beets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just heard from him and I was impressed
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, beets, you can go for beets
apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that is below the ground or just
a little bit above the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: not competing for sun space with cannabis
is preferred.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the idea that you went towards
culinary herbs, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm thinking, you know,
herbal plants and weeds, not something
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm going to go and snip and go throw
on some scallions and avocado with soy
[SPEAKER_02]: sauce, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea of having an actual culinary herb
garden below my plant sounds easy and
[SPEAKER_02]: delicious at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're all for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like that we are out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please put your hands together for Dr.
Krunachari and Joshua Steensland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you both so much.
Thank you.
