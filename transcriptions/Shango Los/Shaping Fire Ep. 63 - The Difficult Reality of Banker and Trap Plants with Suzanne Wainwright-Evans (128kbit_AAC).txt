[SPEAKER_02]: The more I learn about cannabis plants,
the more I understand the complexities of
[SPEAKER_02]: designing cannabis gardens One of the
first things I had to rid myself of was
[SPEAKER_02]: the belief that everything I already had
learned was correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: True learning in any field necessitates
that I remain willing to adapt my
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding when presented with new
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt, this is a challenge we see on
cannabis forums and social media threads
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks argue vigorously and even get angry
defending what their mentor taught them
[SPEAKER_02]: even though there isn't any reproducible
support for their relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, I often think that I know what
I'm talking about only to find out I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Shaping Fire, I'm very careful with the
kind of information I spread because I
[SPEAKER_02]: know folks trust me to not repeat
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's an episode that makes this most
clear to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was building an interview
about why banker and trap plants were so
[SPEAKER_02]: important to the garden and which ones to
choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was wrong.

[SPEAKER_02]: Today, my guest is entomologist,
Suzanne Wainwright Evans, also known as
[SPEAKER_02]: the Bug Lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suzanne graduated from the University of
Florida with degrees in both entomology
[SPEAKER_02]: and environmental horticulture and has
been working in horticulture for more than
[SPEAKER_02]: 28 years and in cannabis since
normalization began.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her focus has been on biological control
and using pesticides properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has worked throughout the United
States and internationally consulting to
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses, nurseries, theme parks,
and gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is, without a doubt, the preeminent
cannabis pest expert in the United States
[SPEAKER_02]: and is a sought after speaker for cannabis
events everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I thought today was going to be a
guide to the best plants to use and why
[SPEAKER_02]: trap and banker plants were so essential,
instead we're going to learn about trap
[SPEAKER_02]: and banker plants in depth while also
realizing how hard they are to use,
[SPEAKER_02]: the complexities and challenges of using
them in the cannabis garden, why the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants suggested so often on forums don't
actually work in real life, and finally
[SPEAKER_02]: some strategies for making banker and trap
plants work for you if you're willing to
[SPEAKER_02]: put in the effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people throw these
terms banker plants and trap plants back
[SPEAKER_02]: and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use them synonymously in a lot of
ways, and then they kind of put them all
[SPEAKER_02]: under the category of companion plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I want to do is tease these apart
so we can really understand how to use
[SPEAKER_02]: these more effectively in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you start by defining what banker
plants are and what trap plants are?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how they're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the idea of banker plants is
a food source for your beneficials,
[SPEAKER_00]: an alternate food source than what you
want them to feed on in the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most popularly used ones right
now in ornamental production is the aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: banker plant system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that if you release these
tiny parasitoid wasps, which kill aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you just release them and you don't
have many aphids in your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all going to die because they
don't really have a food source and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: place to lay their eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you do is you provide this plant,
and on the banker plant you're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: providing a different aphid species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a complex system that you
have the plant and you have a pest insect
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's crucial is that you have to
make sure that those pest insects in this
[SPEAKER_00]: situation these aphids don't move onto
your primary crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a way to maintain a
population of your beneficials without
[SPEAKER_00]: actually having the pest in your crop at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to use like an aphid banker
plant system and then we also have one for
[SPEAKER_00]: aureus, which is the minute pyre bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to use that to build
populations of beneficials in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse before the pest arrives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you already have this standing army of
beneficials ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they can provide food that your crop
necessarily can't provide because when you
[SPEAKER_00]: look again at aureus, the minute pyre bug,
it needs pollen in its diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most crops do not have readily
available pollen or the right kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by providing the pepper plants,
we're providing a pollen source that
[SPEAKER_00]: aureus really love so that they can
reproduce successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flip side of that are trap crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do kind of exactly what they say
is they trap your pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually been some really good
research done on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, in some situations,
it's not been very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is to plant a crop that is
tastier than the plants you're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to try to draw the pest out of the
crop you're growing into the trap crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will then either bag these
plants and remove them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people treat them with a pesticide
so that when the pests feed on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's been work trying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the more famous studies was done up
in Canada and they were looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: poinsettias and eggplants for white fly
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, the white flies were
just way too happy on the poinsettias and
[SPEAKER_00]: they wouldn't leave to go to the eggplant,
even though eggplant's a really good host
[SPEAKER_00]: for white fly also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that common as seen the trap
crops as banker plants because the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: you also have to be careful of is if you
put out these plants and you're growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, all these eggplants to try to
pull white fly, if you don't take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: those trap crops, it basically can turn
into a pest breeding system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that happen a lot with banker
plant systems too.
[SPEAKER_00]: People forget about them, people ignore
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like on the banker plant systems,
the pepper plants then become breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: grounds for aphids and thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are programs that you have to
stay on top of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just plant them and walk away
because you do have to treat these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for pest crops, I mean for pest insects
and mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw in there also, there's also
insectary plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are plants we use that provide
pretty much pollen and nectar for
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a term that's used a bit more
outdoors when you plant plants around
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well, alyssum's one that's used,
calendula, things like that that provide
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen and nectar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's dig into the banker plants first
because you caught me off guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually never realized that folks who
have got a good program are actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, pre-charging their banker
plants with an associated species.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, like your example,
an aphid, but not an aphid that
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily prefers cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are creating a food source for,
in this case, the wasps, but the species
[SPEAKER_02]: of aphid that they are setting up on those
banker plants are actually not one that is
[SPEAKER_02]: harmful to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I understand that correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that particular system, we generally
use barley, some people use oats,
[SPEAKER_00]: but basically it needs to be a type of
grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's been studies done looking
at what works the best and barley produces
[SPEAKER_00]: the most aphids on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the bird cherry oat aphid is the
species we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a feeder on monocots, so it won't
move to dioecious plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will stay on grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a grass grower, you would
not use this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are growing not grasses,
there could always be one weird example,
[SPEAKER_00]: but generally you're okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you grow in dracaenas,
no, we don't use this in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there can be some issues with some
lilies, but so far, as to date,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have not seen the bird cherry oat aphid
actually on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way, you're rearing these aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular system only works with
aphidus colmani.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several different aphid
parasitoids, but this particular system is
[SPEAKER_00]: for colmani, which colmani will parasitize
things like cotton melon aphid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it does also parasitize the cannabis
aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the magic silver bullet for cannabis
aphid?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but it definitely is part of the
management program for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and overall integrated pest
management in the truest sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it interesting that banker plants
actually have got two very distinct roles,
[SPEAKER_02]: that not only can they be pre-charged with
an associated non-pest that can feed your
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficials, because I think all of us who
have used beneficials in the past have run
[SPEAKER_02]: into the problem that when the beneficials
do their job and suddenly the pest numbers
[SPEAKER_02]: are down, suddenly there's no food source
for them and they either die or wander
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then also secondarily, since the
banker plant is of a type that the pest
[SPEAKER_02]: also likes, the pests are hopefully moving
over to the banker plants as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only are you providing a secondary
food source for them so they stay alive,
[SPEAKER_02]: your beneficials stay alive, but also it
creates a secondary environment that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I would never depend,
I don't think it's ever really with the
[SPEAKER_00]: barley, it's not really going to pull any
of your pests from your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the pepper banker plant systems,
because anybody that's ever grown peppers
[SPEAKER_00]: know the western flower thrips love them,
onion thrips can get on them, spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: can get it on them, several aphid species
can get on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peppers could possibly function in a way
as a trap or a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, and it was funny, I was just talking
to another researcher about this the other
[SPEAKER_00]: day, often times when an insect is raised
on one plant, it's very difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer it to an alternate host.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we know it feeds on it,
it tends to want to stay on the same plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species that it grew up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often it's prodigy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is why, you know,
trap crops not completely sold on it for
[SPEAKER_00]: key pests we're dealing with, I would say
in cannabis and ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about agriculture or other
settings, but it's something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: really would have to really work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, again, it's too much work
for most people to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well the research alone to make sure
that you're finding tuning your
[SPEAKER_02]: alternative pest and also pre-charging
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is certainly a commercial
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: The commercial folks who are listening and
they're probably getting a lot of value
[SPEAKER_02]: out of that, but that's way beyond what a
state medical grower or a personal grower
[SPEAKER_02]: are probably going to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you saying that if our pests are
growing up on cannabis and they have grown
[SPEAKER_02]: up eating it and so therefore they like
it, that in most cases, using a trap plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that we perceive is going to be tastier
than cannabis might not actually be
[SPEAKER_02]: ineffective, that folks in cannabis are
using these trap plants, but it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: not a solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of an ornamental solution than a
cannabis solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, until the research is done,
and we know for sure it's hard to have an
[SPEAKER_00]: answer, and also let's take, for example,
bean plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bean plants are one that we started doing
some stuff with actually in roses outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: because spider mites love bean plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to raise spider mites,
like I'll raise them sometimes here at the
[SPEAKER_00]: house, I'll raise them on bean plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of their favorite food sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were using them in roses,
it's like, okay, as soon as we see spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites on the bean plants outside,
we know they're coming on the roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then is when we would start our
predatory mite program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, we found out that it
turned out to be a better indicator plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what an indicator plant
lets you know when a pest is in an area,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it indicates to you that it
actually worked out better for flea
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles, because the flea beetles would
actually hit the beans before they would
[SPEAKER_00]: move into the roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually, we learned something from
that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I sometimes wonder if we have these
bean plants out, how do we know that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just not a separate population breeding on
the beans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what's actually breeding on the
roses, and are those two-spot spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beans going to move into the roses?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know until there's study done
with the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the number one problem I see
over and over and over again is someone
[SPEAKER_00]: forgets about the bean plants,
they get busy doing other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then next you know you have bean
plants covered in webbing, and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: they're infested with spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your indicator was probably 10 days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I see that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing, and I just had a
situation with this in Maine, where
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody contacted me freaking out because
they had aphids all over their foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that they were using a
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, they're using cover crops
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cover crops turns into just a
breeding ground for all kinds of insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And aphids often will, you know,
if they're not happy or their populations
[SPEAKER_00]: get high, they'll pick up and leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll start walking up the cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that situation, the aphids weren't
doing any damage to the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just out looking for a new host
coming off the cover crop, which some
[SPEAKER_00]: people are using air quote cover crops as
either banker plants or insectary plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not paying attention to what
other potential pests they could get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as indicator plants go,
I understand that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: specificity from one pest to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: But are we lucky enough in cannabis that
there happens to be an indicator plant
[SPEAKER_02]: species that is similar to cannabis
perhaps, that's a little maybe sweeter or
[SPEAKER_02]: tastier for these plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: That we may be able to plant alongside our
cannabis that would draw the pests first
[SPEAKER_02]: and we could keep an eye on those before
they hit the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on what pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you look at right now
what our major pests are, the stuff that I
[SPEAKER_00]: get contacted about every single day,
you know, cannabis aphid, hemp russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mite, root aphid, those, they're cannabis
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't live on alternate hosts at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have been contacted a lot this year
about thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now thrips because, again, a lot of what
I'm finding are onion thrips, which I will
[SPEAKER_00]: consider a generalist, you know,
I hate when they say the name onion thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: because everybody assumes, oh,
it's just a pest of onions, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily true because there are a
problem in ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just a survey done in Canada and
something like a quarter of all thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: found in the Niagara region were onion
thrips over Western flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're definitely around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, again, are they going to
want to be in ornamental pepper over the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also remember the immature insects
cannot fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you can do is pull adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't pull eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't pull immature mites can't fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really can't pull mites either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, again, this could only be for
flying adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's possibly, you know, they've
already on your crop laid lots of eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I just see growers trying to do a
lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to say they get in over
their head, but we don't have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics yet and enough research yet to
support a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers have to stay focused on
maintaining these plants, which tends not
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I was at a facility out on the west
coast earlier this year, and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, we have banker plants, you know,
the peppers, they're sitting around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, are you putting Oreos on
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, then get rid of them,
you know, because again, they're just a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding ground for broad mite,
Western flower thrips, onion thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites, you know, aphids,
you know, just get rid of it if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's double back to the interesting
comment you made about cover crops
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors, because, of course, polyculture
is becoming increasingly popular,
[SPEAKER_02]: both outdoor cannabis growing and now
indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some great examples of it
because, of course, you know, having these
[SPEAKER_02]: other species of plants, not having the
mono crop is really great for the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere and for, you know,
the plants to be able to communicate and
[SPEAKER_02]: share nutrition and all this great kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but you're suggesting that these these
these indoor cover crops are also a
[SPEAKER_02]: potential threat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you speak to that a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I'm going to say this and I've
said this a million times, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when growing indoors is not like growing
outside and outside when you do cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, you know, you've got the natural
ecology, the natural soil ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving you air quotes on that natural
soil because we all know soil has been
[SPEAKER_00]: altered too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have thousands of insects and
mites that can move in naturally and help
[SPEAKER_00]: keep things a little more in check.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you enclose yourself into an indoor
grow that's sealed up, it is nothing like
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have rain which which washes
pests and bugs off of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have, again, parasitoids just
flying in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have all these different
beneficials showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, do you put up a giant wall
against beneficials getting in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when pests get in, that's why they
go really crazy indoors, because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing really to control them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, again, kind of the issue
inside is because a lot of these cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops have complex pest systems and people
don't think about managing pests on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, essentially, you've got two crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your cannabis and you've got
your cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to research what pests and
diseases those are going to get and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to treat those for the pests and the
diseases now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's frustrating, too,
especially since, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: because most of the folks who are going to
be running an indoor polyculture
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, they are probably also the
mindset that they are going to be using
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's great on its face.
[SPEAKER_02]: But listening to you describe all of the
different variables that help us when we
[SPEAKER_02]: are growing outdoors, reproducing those
indoors becomes less and less likely based
[SPEAKER_02]: on time, resources, and just the
difficulty in trying to, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: bring in the variety of beneficial insects
that we're able to get outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly, you're not a big fan of cover
cropping or probably more accurately,
[SPEAKER_02]: green mulching indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's turn that on its head for a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody were to going to polyculture
indoors, even if it's a thin sliced
[SPEAKER_02]: window, what do you think would be the
best way for them to go about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is there a, you know, if 95% of
people who are going to do it are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it wrong, is there a 5% best practice
that you would recommend for people who
[SPEAKER_02]: are dead set on doing polyculture indoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what would be your best advice for
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, you know, and this is
a thing that, you know, I bang my head on
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall kind of thing, because again,
I get contacted by numerous growers every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the polyculture living soil
people freak out when they find bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is if you're trying to
recreate indoor ecology, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have bugs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, you know, less than 1% of
insects are really a problem of economic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what we consider economic
importance, where they're going to damage
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people want to do this stuff inside,
but want to see no insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: At all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the insects that I am getting
images of are just absolutely benign
[SPEAKER_00]: things that, you know, detritivores,
or, you know, maybe specific to feeding on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you wanted to do it, the first
thing I would do is I would pick your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, I would research that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, is it a host for spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a host for cotton melon aphid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a host for onion thrips?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would look to make sure that not,
can it just feed on it occasionally,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is it a major problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm going to pick the worst
possible cover crop ever, soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because soybeans are beans, you know,
we were talking about before, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: great for being spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there, soybeans would be off your
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also pretty anti-marigold,
because when we are marigolds in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses, they get every pest problem
known to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get spider mites, they get thrips
issues, they have a lot of disease issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like to hold marigolds in this,
you know, holy vessel of this is this
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is people don't understand
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, you know, old stuff that refers
to marigolds are actually pot marigolds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are calendula, which are not today's
marigolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today's marigolds, and this is a whole
nother rabbit hole discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants that you get today and the
seeds you get today have been bred for
[SPEAKER_00]: human characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we want?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them this height.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them this color.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the big showy petals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've not been bred for feeding
beneficials, for feeding pollinators and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've bred a lot of the
characteristics out of these plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: insects need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at a marigold and how tightly
peddled it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is a beneficial supposed to get down
in there to get pollen and nectar?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at some of the older simpler
marigolds that are more single peddled,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's you have easier access
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing when you look at roses,
the older rose varieties that open up the
[SPEAKER_00]: bees and beneficials can get in there to
the pollen and nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: These new, really tight, bald,
fancy roses, they can't have access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some plant species, they've
actually bred to the point there's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically no pollen or it's useless pollen
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be really careful about
looking at these plants and understand
[SPEAKER_00]: just saying marigold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marigold is like saying almost automobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a generic term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can encompass multiple, you know,
again, it could be calendula.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's too broad of a term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I know a lot of people look
at clover and then of course I get the
[SPEAKER_00]: messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're freaking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clover mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, clover mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, thrips is secondary one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question is, is what thrips do
they have on the clover and will it feed
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where it gets into
identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't just use a hand lens
normally to identify thrips species.
[SPEAKER_00]: To tell the difference between like
western flower and onion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you pretty much have to have super
high magnification or put them under
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope, which is high magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a few of them like, you know,
a kind of thrips, that's easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify, but that's super high
magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you can't just stand there
and say, this is that without,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, you got to get in there and look at
their little hairs basically on their
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies to tell them apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what frustrates me when I go to a lot
of these meetings is people just
[SPEAKER_00]: oversimplify it and they're like,
oh, just plant this cover crop and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: never have any pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it worked that way, why do I have all
these growers contacting me every single
[SPEAKER_00]: day?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go right down that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to, I'm going to put salt in
that wound, Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so certainly people who are commercial
growers who are listening, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they've got a dedicated IPM person and
they are, you know, hopefully have got the
[SPEAKER_02]: time to do the kind of research that we've
been calling for so far so that a proper
[SPEAKER_02]: program can be developed for their bio
region and particularly their types of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, environment and plants,
whether indoor, outdoor or greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the vast majority of people who are
listening today are not commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they've got somewhere between,
you know, four and 40 plants in their yard
[SPEAKER_02]: and they don't necessarily have the time
and access to resources to do an entire
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the touring that you have done so
far, and I know, I know that I'm talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about an entire country, but bear with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you come across any plants that you
think are, you know, pretty good surefire
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to plant alongside your cannabis
that are going to provide either some
[SPEAKER_02]: banker or trap benefits so that people
who, the same, the same people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: just like, oh, I heard that marigolds are
good around my cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they, so they grew marigolds,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we now know that's not appropriate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but even though we know that done
properly, this is a bigger question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we go to commercial, is there,
are there any varieties that you think are
[SPEAKER_02]: generally going to help?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to plant anything
without doing your proper homework,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should go with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you should ask me what I
do in my yard because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though I don't grow cannabis here,
you know, I grow tomatoes and I ring all
[SPEAKER_00]: my tomato plants with a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them, because we know, and there's
been good research looking at this a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is a really good, uh, pollen nectar
source for Oreos, the minute pyre bug,
[SPEAKER_00]: which loves thrips, which will feed on
spider mites and loves cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I scout, um, uh, cannabis
outdoors, um, whether it be New York state
[SPEAKER_00]: or California or Oregon, Washington,
I always find Oreos in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know it loves that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and again, it needs pollen and nectar
and your cannabis isn't going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen and nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes early on don't have pollen and
nectar, but I put the alyssum around them
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that will feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, commercial growers actually grow
pots of alyssum early in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then they sprinkle Oreos on there
and they build the Oreos population up on
[SPEAKER_00]: them so that when the thrips come in the
spring, they have a whole army of Oreos
[SPEAKER_00]: there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you Oreos though needs at
least 12 hours of sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or it will, you know, go into,
uh, what they call diapause, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, you know, insect hibernation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, in the Southern regions,
we don't worry about that too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but up North, um, in greenhouses,
when we start the alyssum early,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just put them under, you know,
if you don't have artificial lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just put them under artificial lighting
to make sure they get 12 hours of light
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the homeowner, the smaller grow,
um, you know, you can buy alyssum,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, from seed and you can just start it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would not recommend buying finished
plants in because you do not know what
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been treated with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you don't know if they've been treated
with an insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know if they've been treated
with a PGR or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better off to grow them yourself
just to, to make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think alyssum is one that we have a
really good track record in ornamentals
[SPEAKER_00]: and vegetable with, with that we're seeing
it slowly being adopted into cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got a good track record of being a
good banker plant as well as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, nectar and pollen resource plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go ahead and take our
first short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to shaping fire and my
guest today is entomologist Suzanne
[SPEAKER_02]: Wainwright Evans, the bug lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a replacement for using peat
[SPEAKER_02]: moss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_02]: container growing, but organic growers
know that peat moss is an unsustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: resource and the mining of peat bogs
destroys habitat and releases sequestered
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now there's finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that shares the
[SPEAKER_02]: same benefits while also being
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystems, it actually is made from
upcycled organic paper and tree bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_02]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption and water conservation
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades long
[SPEAKER_02]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat
moss and handles exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like peat moss, pit moss is inert,
so it won't change your pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Available in a range of preparations,
including a nutrient enhanced blend,
[SPEAKER_02]: a coco coir blend, and also as an organic
soil conditioner with no added nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go to pitmoss.com now to learn more.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's P-I-T-T-M-O-S-S.
[SPEAKER_02]: For many, transitioning to organic
gardening can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much to learn about soil
biology and fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bioflux fermented plant booths from
Everflux simplifies organic farming so you
[SPEAKER_02]: can start growing organically today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Invented by a California farmer growing
organic for 40 years, Bioflux is a
[SPEAKER_02]: fermented natural farming preparation for
those who want a natural micro booth
[SPEAKER_02]: without having to brew their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: This extraordinary chemical-free growth
and terpene enhancer improves root
[SPEAKER_02]: development, accelerates the conversion of
organic matter into humus, increases
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient use efficiency and uptake,
and increases beneficial microbactivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to the Bioflux fermented plant
booster, Everflux also makes an activated
[SPEAKER_02]: biochar called teraflux that is infused
with the Bioflux plant booster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine combining the buffering and
rhizosphere enhancing qualities of biochar
[SPEAKER_02]: infused with a range of earthworm
castings, insect frass, kelp and crab
[SPEAKER_02]: meal, oyster shell, and other ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using teraflux infused biochar this
summer myself, and it smells alive,
[SPEAKER_02]: rich, and potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: These products have been scientifically
proven to match yields and increase flower
[SPEAKER_02]: quality and pest resistance when compared
to traditional NPK inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are looking for reliable organic
fertilizers that will free you up to focus
[SPEAKER_02]: on other aspects of your garden,
consider using the range of all natural
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative fertilizers and natural
biostimulants from Everflux.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find out more at EverfluxTechnologies.com
or by following their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: Everflux.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I love growing under the sun,
there's a lot of good reasons to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're like most folks,
you want a lighting source that grows
[SPEAKER_02]: high-yielding, healthy plants without
using excessive amounts of electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: BIOS lighting creates biological lighting
solutions that brings the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: brilliance of the outdoors into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: BIOS lighting has the attributes that I
look for in a horticultural lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've bought those cheap lights online and
they're difficult to work with and fail in
[SPEAKER_02]: no time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In contrast, my BIOS LED light is
industrial grade to last a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is IP 66 wet rated, so little foliar
overspray won't harm it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is easy to clean without taking it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the most important aspect,
it is built for the exact light spectrum I
[SPEAKER_02]: want for great yielding, healthy care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't hurt that their lighting
rigs look badass too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many horticultural LED lighting systems
are based on irrelevant performance
[SPEAKER_02]: metrics and people love to argue online
about these numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to judge on PAR photon efficiency
and how happy my plants are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the BIOS lights exceed my expectations
in these categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: BIOS lights have an optimized broad
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_02]: plant growth while also providing the
ideal conditions for superior PAR
[SPEAKER_02]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a comfortable visual experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also love their attentive and
overeducated customer service folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: BIOS starts with a team of biologists
before getting the electrical engineers
[SPEAKER_02]: involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have studied how light impacts
cannabis plants and devised an overall
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage you to check out their website
at bioslighting.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_02]: how this strategy can work for you.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our guest this week is entomologist,
Suzanne Wainwright-Evans, the bug lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Suzanne, you know, we were talking in
the last set about how, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: folks want to be polyculture and organic
and regenerative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they try to do that indoors,
often they've got a head space that they
[SPEAKER_02]: also want sterility, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that we know from
trying to do regenerative agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors is that sterility is not really
our goal outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we are trying to create an entire
ecosystem back and forth with the
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystem around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're trying to blend with the
ecosystem and not stay separate so that
[SPEAKER_02]: the natural benefits of the outdoor
environment can be supportive of our
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis garden as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, indoors, of course, we are not
getting the benefits of being,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, couched in a regular organic
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so indoor folks, they try to walk this
line between we need to keep the grow
[SPEAKER_02]: clean and an air quotes sterile so that we
don't run into any disease or pest
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you know,
doing that is not going to be very
[SPEAKER_02]: effective for trying to replicate an
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of advice do you give folks who
are trying to walk that line?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a very difficult line to
walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's this mindset of you can
reproduce outdoors, indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I don't think it's completely
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be sustainable, but you also then
understand that you are running at higher
[SPEAKER_00]: risk of pests and disease by doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's not what you want to hear,
but that's especially over the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years, working with more regenerative
growers is what I see over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to not change out your
soil, for example, and you're pumping in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all these fungi and bacteria and
top dressing with compost, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: mites and insects are going to find their
way in because decomposers are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to live in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have a lot of that
kind of stuff living in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just again today, I was contacted by
somebody else that, oh, my gosh,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's all these mites in my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I kill them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're most likely just either
detritivores or they're feeding on fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: or some kind of soil decomposer kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not hurting anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can get to such high numbers that
you literally can scrape them off the edge
[SPEAKER_00]: of the beds with credit cards because they
get so heavy and people don't want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to grow in these kinds
of systems, that's the kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the trade off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have to expect to see
you're going to have a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: springtails.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a lot more,
again, of these decomposing kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and mites in those systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question I get all the time is,
do they damage the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, things like springtails,
which are columbula, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we honestly, they haven't been studied as
extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are numerous species of
columbula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone just contacts me and says
they have springtails, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: super high numbers, are they going to
cause damage to my crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't know because we don't
know what species it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does that species actually cause
damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in Europe, they do have problems
in like antherium production with
[SPEAKER_00]: springtails damaging the roots on
antherium crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're busy trying to kill them,
where oftentimes over here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: it's seen as a sign of soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I think this comes down to
different species and the different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't just make a broad blanket
statement that they're good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is if you have a high
organic matter soil, you're going to end
[SPEAKER_00]: up with a lot of them and you're just
going to have to learn to live with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it brings us back to, you know,
your gospel, which is identification is
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting, you know,
I tour quite a few regenerative cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens and how few of them I also see
people having a microscope nearby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I continually tell people is,
you know, it's one thing when you are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do kind of like a non
regenerative synthetic grow when your best
[SPEAKER_02]: practice is kind of like kill everything,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just kind of like carpet
bombing your grow with the things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in a regenerative grow, when you're
like, okay, we only really want to get rid
[SPEAKER_02]: of the 1% of the pests that may actually
be a threat.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way you're going to do that is if
you get educated on identifying these
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pests and, and, and have a microscope,
which honestly, you should probably have
[SPEAKER_02]: to be making sure that your compost is
active anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can imagine that you are busy
giving, you know, lessons to people when
[SPEAKER_02]: you tour their grows that says,
you know, you need a bench over here with
[SPEAKER_02]: a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I generally, I find that most
growers don't know how to use microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they have microscopes, they don't
take care of them, which is painful to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't keep the covers on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because speaking from someone that had to
have their microscope recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my microscopes recently service,
get your microscope clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's $300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a cover on it to keep the dust out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yes, there's dust in grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why I really push people to the
dino lights because it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about,
you know, stuff getting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take pictures because when you say
microscope, microscopes are meant to be
[SPEAKER_00]: used with slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the insects growers aren't
going to slide mount insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a pain in the backside to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put the special glue mount
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use like a little one hair bristle brush
to get their legs in position and get the
[SPEAKER_00]: slide cover on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dissecting scopes are more, I think would
be appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, a microscope or dissecting
scope don't necessarily come with the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you got to buy a camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why a dino light is so easy
because it's essentially a dissecting
[SPEAKER_00]: scope with a built in camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you can easily take pictures
and send them because learning to use a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope is a whole thing in itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I, when I saw you, when I saw you
present with the dino scope at
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative conference in, uh,
in Humboldt, I was really blown away by
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but I was, I had the impression that
it did not have the sensitivity for
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that I might need in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was thinking, Oh, might as well not
get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm still going to need a
microscope, um, at some point anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and what I'm hearing you say now as
actually making me think, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I don't actually need the microscope,
if actually what I need is a dissection
[SPEAKER_02]: scope that the tool that you showed us,
the dino scope actually may be the one
[SPEAKER_02]: tool for, for all the gardeners needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that your experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't want to say all the needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, probably not for cutting,
not probably not for looking at compost
[SPEAKER_02]: team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost, you need a microscope when it
comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, for insect stuff, you know,
the first thing I bought 20 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, first big fancy thing I bought,
uh, for was a dissecting scope,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a microscope, a dissecting scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put a leaf under, you can cut a
branch under because you can put,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, things with height on them,
a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only put things with slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have bugs on a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't put a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under a microscope, you got to lift the
bug off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put it on a slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put a slide cover on and do all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dissecting scope, you can just slap it
under and look at it and away you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a dino light basically functions as a
dissecting scope with a built in camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can buy, um, cameras for your
microscope or your dissecting scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you buy your microscope or dino
scope, you have to, I mean, microscope or
[SPEAKER_00]: dissecting scope, you have to make sure
it's a triocular camera of triocular
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have one for each eye and then you
have a third hole that you can mount a
[SPEAKER_00]: camera on because it is, I mean,
the pictures people send me and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is one of my grapes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you want free ID,
at least meet me halfway and send me
[SPEAKER_00]: decent pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, stop putting your camera up to
the eye hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: On your microscope and trying to get an
image that's blurred around the edge and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you can get a dino
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entry level one is like a hundred
bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the one that's $325 is a better
place to be, but you can even get a decent
[SPEAKER_00]: dissecting scope for like $300 these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not talking, you know,
yes, you can go spend as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I, you can spend $10,000 on
a microscope, but for most cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: people, the, the ones from, um,
Celestron makes a really nice dissecting
[SPEAKER_00]: scope and I really love the Celestron
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if you're somebody that's going to
spend 10 hours a day at a microscope
[SPEAKER_00]: counting, you know, cells or things like
that, yes, you need the $10,000 microscope
[SPEAKER_00]: because it will really reduce the eye
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just slapping something on
there, looking for five minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're done, you can use these
three $400 microscopes and they work
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one from Celestron, that
microscope, um, I've had it now a year and
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing negative to say,
and it's a triocular one and you can mount
[SPEAKER_00]: a camera right on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that's great about the
Dinoscope too, is that it's so compact
[SPEAKER_02]: that, um, it's really easy to safely pack
in your gear and take with you either out
[SPEAKER_02]: into the field or, you know, if you're,
if you're doing the rounds over a multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial grows, it's just, you know,
most of us think about a, a, a microscope
[SPEAKER_02]: or a dissection scope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, it tends to be more,
it, you set it up and it stays and it
[SPEAKER_02]: lives in this one place, but the Dinoscope
is really, um, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's highly mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for, so for folks who are going to
forget the name Dinoscope, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go ahead, excuse me, DinoLite,
um, like I just did, I'll go ahead and put
[SPEAKER_02]: a link, uh, on the page for the podcast
episode at shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going back to the banker plants and the
trap plant, Suzanne, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people have a different
difference of opinion of, of actually
[SPEAKER_02]: where you plant them, um, with container
gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks believe that you should be
planting them below the cannabis plant in
[SPEAKER_02]: the same pot so that they're close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, uh, you know, from what I'm
gathering from what you've been saying so
[SPEAKER_02]: far and how I like to do it is you
actually put the plant in its own pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, along the edges of the growing area.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you find is the best practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think having them in their own pots,
because if they get a pest problem and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in a pot, you just pick the pot up
and chuck it out the door and it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, with the aphid banker plant
systems, we replace those like every two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a constant revolving door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and alyssum, if it gets too hot,
um, it can stop blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got all this, you know,
just greenery in your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely do them in separate pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different watering requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not plant them right in the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have them in pots you can remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing, um, is let's say,
okay, let's just pretend, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's going great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got great aureus going in there
with your alyssum, but oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we've got hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're going to have to come in and
spray because I've said this before,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know a lot of people hate me,
but you know, I do not think that any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the biocontrol agents are really
controlling hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: All our successes have been coming in and
spraying with a good solid horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've got those banker plants and
they're planted in your pots and you come
[SPEAKER_00]: in and spray, they're going to get oil on
the banker plants and possibly could
[SPEAKER_00]: either damage the plant because I don't
think alyssum really wants a coating of
[SPEAKER_00]: oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and also, um, it could kill some of
the insects and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to spray, you know,
something like Bavaria or Isaiah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whatever you're going to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the banker plants, what we do,
and this is what we do in ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: systems is we go through, we just gather
up all the banker plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do our spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wait a few days and then we bring the
banker plants right back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way you want to keep them in their
own pots so they're mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can remove them and you can bring them
back and you can swap them out when you
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and honestly, you know, if you're
going to be properly taking care of these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, they're, they're, you know,
the food that their rhizosphere wants or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, the soil requirements are likely
going to be different than what you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to be doing for your cannabis anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I had one, um, grower that,
um, he does the diet for, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is ornamentals, but again,
you know, I've had a bajillion years of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what I've been doing is how can we
take that knowledge and apply it to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but this one ornamental grower,
he keeps lined along the wall of his
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse mullen plants with another,
a beneficial insect called Dicecyphus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it likes thrips, white flies,
and also snack on spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he has a pest issue,
then he picks up a couple of pots of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mullen plants and he goes and sets them
and he just sisters them next to where the
[SPEAKER_00]: pest problem is and leaves them there so
that the Dicecyphus then move into the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, clean up the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then eventually he moves the mullen plants
back together into their lineup along the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall where the Dicecyphus can just sit
there and continually breed on the mullen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he uses them as like a hotspot
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, another reason why to have them
in pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really great best practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an awesome idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when choosing them, I mean,
certainly it sounds like the majority of
[SPEAKER_02]: the time we are going to choose our plants
based on the specificity of what our pest
[SPEAKER_02]: is and what our alternative snacking pest
will be for our beneficial insect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really that will kind of reverse
engineer which plant we want to go with to
[SPEAKER_02]: system with the cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a secondary awareness that folks
have about annuals and perennials because
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these plants that people have a
tendency to use, they've got shorter life
[SPEAKER_02]: cycles and they really just want to plant
it and forget it, right, which is part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how do you explain to people or get
them thinking in the right way about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, matching the life cycle with of
the plant that the banker or trap plant
[SPEAKER_02]: with the life cycle of the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And my suspicion is you're just going to
say grow a whole ton of them in their own
[SPEAKER_02]: pots and swap them in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just answered your own question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was asking it, I'm like, I think
she's already taught this today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not to say down the road,
somebody may find the magic bean that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can plant under cannabis and
it thrives and, you know, it has no pest
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but as of yet, we've not found
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think having them in separate pots
and try to look for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, where there has been a little
research done and not just anecdotal
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, because, you know, I mean,
I know anecdotals is oftentimes where
[SPEAKER_00]: research starts, but I'm just seeing a lot
of people getting themselves into trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, people generally don't
call me when everything's hunky dory.
[SPEAKER_00]: People contact me when there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to hear about what everybody's
done to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely see a pattern of,
you know, cover crops and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: same soil with multiple, multiple harvests
or multiple plants planted in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pest numbers are just going to build
in those situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there really is a fine area between,
you know, citizen science and bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of them, you're actually
testing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one, you're probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just how you learned it from your
friend or your mentor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we cannabis people,
we've been on our own for a long time and
[SPEAKER_02]: we haven't had access necessarily to legit
entomologists.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's going to take a little
more time for not only their research to
[SPEAKER_02]: come about and to actually be done,
but also for, you know, cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators to realize that, you know,
there is useful information available
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you're going to hate this next
question, Suzanne, but let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, because, you know, you are,
you know, you are very clear that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you have to be aware of your bio
region, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, you know, when you answer a
question, it's going to be a different
[SPEAKER_02]: answer for California versus Florida
versus Maine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, with the cultivators in the
different parts of the country,
[SPEAKER_02]: each having their own sorts of pests that
they need to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you recommend like a mental
methodology?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you suggest thinking through what
trap plant or what pests the cultivator is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to want to think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which ones do they want to prepare for is
what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you want to prepare for the pests
that you don't have yet, but there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: wide range of pests that could be a
problem with cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what hints do you give to cultivators
to kind of be prescient and look into the
[SPEAKER_02]: future of what pests you want to prepare
for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because these are the ones that you're
most likely to get where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the things is that for the
indoor grows, we're seeing a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same stuff because they're a bit excluded
from, you know, the outdoor ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when we have, you know, outdoor
production or a greenhouses where the
[SPEAKER_00]: sides roll up or a high tunnel situation
where we do have regional stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, you know, the one thing that has
been very interesting to watch is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically how the cannabis industry has
managed to spread their pests throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: their own industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you look at the cannabis aphid,
which was somewhat isolated to the West
[SPEAKER_00]: coast and now is everywhere on the East
coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's moved through people sharing
plant material and cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the industry has done it to
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've completely shared hemp russet mite
across all U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've totally shared, again,
the cannabis aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've shared root aphid, because even
though the root aphid species we're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with has other hosts, it's not
something you're going to walk out and
[SPEAKER_00]: find in your yard like a two spot spider
mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find those everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, these cannabis specific
pests, I mean, everybody wants to blame
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to blame, you know, your
neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is you brought in
plants that were infected to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things I, you know,
where did your plants come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you came from the West coast,
it's a good chance you brought hemp russet
[SPEAKER_00]: or cannabis aphid right along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if someone's on the East coast and
like, OK, we're growing from seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they're at very low risk of having
cannabis aphid or hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think there needs to be
necessarily preventative programs for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you know, cuts from other
production facilities, especially if they
[SPEAKER_00]: originated wet west coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you better be prepared, especially
for hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, when I think about a program,
we follow the genetics of the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's their history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that gives me, you know,
what kind of risk are we at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the first place I start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, we look at what their
history of pests have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, have you had problems with
spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had, you know, history of,
you know, aphids?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, what species?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we look through that to try
to put a program together and then always,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, have such a good scouting
program so that if there is a new pest
[SPEAKER_00]: issue that pops up, it's detected early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that way, then we can get in and
decide the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's the first place I
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, we look through that
to try to put a program together and then
[SPEAKER_00]: always, you know, have such a good
scouting program so that if there is a new
[SPEAKER_00]: pest issue that pops up, it's detected
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, we look through that
to try to put a program together and then
[SPEAKER_00]: always, you know, release all the
beneficials where you look at industries,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, ornamentals and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we can be releasing
parasitic wasps and we can be releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we have a flare up of a two spot
spider mite, we can come in and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: this one chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only kills like five species of spider
mites and we can spray it over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only kills the two spot spider mites
and their eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't kill the predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't kill the parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't kill anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what makes cannabis growing
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the few products you do have are
non-selective and they kill everything
[SPEAKER_00]: good, bad and indifferent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that adds to the challenge there
with managing pests and putting programs
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, a lot of these products
that, you know, are not EPA registered,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't really know even what's in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've run into it in the cannabis
scene so many times that not everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that's in the product is even on the
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, you know, I'm pretty
preachy about using EPA registered
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was like, oh my God,
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But soaps and oils are pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticide only means it kills pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good horticultural oil can kill a
pest, but it's very safe for humans to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting because you see some
products that have the same active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients and one's EPA registered and
one may not be because sometimes people
[SPEAKER_00]: will still go ahead and EPA, they'll go
and register their products even though
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not required on some of these exempt
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep on coming to this idea that either
the research hasn't been done for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: or the products have not been,
that work well have not been, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: properly crossed over to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one way or another, cannabis is not on
par with all of the work that's been done
[SPEAKER_02]: in ornamentals due to its historical
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your seat, you kind of are able to look
both up and down the railway, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're able to look at where the
cultivators are and the problems that they
[SPEAKER_02]: are experiencing, but you're also able to
look upstream at the vendors who would,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, theoretically be selling these
solutions to cultivators because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: the same folks that are selling solutions
in ornamental.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you seeing that these companies are
like, oh my God, cannabis is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: so valuable and so now they are all
hardcore moving into research to cross
[SPEAKER_02]: apply these solutions and to come up with
new products or are they kind of sitting
[SPEAKER_02]: on their hands because they don't
necessarily want to play with cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: folk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not that they don't want to
play with cannabis folk.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you just look at sheer acreage of
cannabis in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not much, realistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether it's a cannabis plant or it's
a corn field, if you're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional pesticides, it's generally
going to be per acre the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you develop products for corn,
you're going to be able to sell an insane
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to sell to, you know,
cannabis, the market's in a way not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not worth their time because they're
not going to get the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the exact same problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, ornamentals have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And realistically, ornamentals,
when you look at pesticide usage overall,
[SPEAKER_00]: they use a very small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really the products often we get in
ornamentals are ones that were developed
[SPEAKER_00]: for, you know, soybeans, corn,
you know, big ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, OK, can there be an
application in ornamentals for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they see if they can make them
fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, again, overall, the ornamental
market is still really not a big business
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as big ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is concerned compared to, you know,
again, corn, soybeans or even just turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cannabis will probably sister right
along with ornamentals and be considered a
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty crop, kind of like cut herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that basically in ornamentals,
again, we just kind of get the crumbs in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that we still get good products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when we get a new pest,
like right now in Florida, we're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with this hibiscus bud weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is any chemical company going to take the
time to develop a chemistry that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take 10 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to cost millions and millions
of dollars to treat for that pest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not, because they'll never get
the return on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I don't think it has nothing to do
with the fact it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with sheer acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if outdoor hemp ever gets to the
levels being grown that like corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans, wheat, you know, and all that's
being grown at, well, then they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely be products for that market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it will probably be looked at to
see, OK, can we get a specialty label for
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll trickle down to THC products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's exactly what will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I see mixed growers out
there, too, because there's some growers
[SPEAKER_00]: that will just never use a synthetic
pesticide on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's just and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's I'm not judging anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other people that are like,
oh, my God, I can't wait till we have
[SPEAKER_00]: registered pesticides to make this growing
a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you have people all the
way across the board and some people are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle and just like, you know,
just give me what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it will be interesting to see how
if it ever, you know, we need the it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal stuff of becoming federally
legal so that the EPA can register
[SPEAKER_00]: products and and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if then, let's just say tomorrow
that EPA products could be registered
[SPEAKER_00]: through the EPA for indoor cannabis,
it's still going to be years before
[SPEAKER_00]: products will readily come available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be able to get some special use
labels which can be pushed through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those, you know, are temporary use
labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you still need research to back up
that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, cannabis is somewhat
considered more of a food crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guess is, though, is that probably the
tobacco companies have already been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of testing and they probably got a
lot of research already in their back
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket just waiting that we don't know
about because it's, you know, still a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of secret, secret stuff because there is
big money in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's probably more research
done than anybody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't publicly let anybody know
you've done the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to they don't want to give
up their position or or suggest what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're working on IP wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like for the for the time being,
we're going to be putting together like
[SPEAKER_02]: various biological hacks in and paying
higher prices when products do come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead and take our last short
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is entomologist Suzanne
Wainwright Evans, the bug lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons why no till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_02]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trouble with growing in new soils or
blended cocoa substrates is that it takes
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the plants life just to create
these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's three times the concentration of
the current leading brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: at nine hundred propagules per gram of two
fungal species selected specifically for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This new product called Dynomyco is the
result of 30 years of research and trials
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Volcani Agriculture Research
Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: since the product first arrived here last
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have already even heard about
Dynomyco by its original name,
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Dynomyco is available at grow shops
and online in the United States for the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of mycelium networks in the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also as a biostimulant to make clone
cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see side by sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco at
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco.com and find out where you can
get yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's D-Y-M-I-C-O.
[SPEAKER_02]: N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots, or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_02]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you listen to Shaping Fire and you grow
your own cannabis, chances are high that
[SPEAKER_02]: you are very particular about the inputs

[SPEAKER_02]: Growing cannabis in greenhouses is taking
over the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: An efficient and effective blend of
sunshine grown terpene profiles and the
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled environment of indoor,
greenhouses can be the best of both
[SPEAKER_02]: worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: For many greenhouse operators though,
building their greenhouse before gaining
[SPEAKER_02]: insight into how cannabis greenhouses
differ from ornamental crops can be the
[SPEAKER_02]: start of a world of hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric Brandstad and his team at Greenhouse
Advisory Group have the experience and
[SPEAKER_02]: technical know-how to help you avoid these
pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric Brandstad has been helping cannabis
growers find locations, design,
[SPEAKER_02]: build and equip their greenhouses for over
a decade, first starting in Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: California but expanding over the last
five years to helping clients throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has an impeccable reputation for both
depth of knowledge and kindness and
[SPEAKER_02]: communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear Eric explain some of the
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_02]: how to overcome them in episode number 41
of the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter where I go in the country,
good people with smart backgrounds still
[SPEAKER_02]: are making the mistake of building without
knowing cannabis and it causes them to
[SPEAKER_02]: burn through capital and time fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has their own failure point.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some, it is improper ventilation
planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: For others, it is surface temperatures of
the building or the plant's leaves or
[SPEAKER_02]: both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks that build their greenhouse
from scratch make really basic errors like
[SPEAKER_02]: placement of the greenhouse on the
property or not understanding the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: environment where the greenhouses sit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some have even built a decent greenhouse
but are inefficient in their deployment of
[SPEAKER_02]: light deprivation techniques and never
really hit their target yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great when you learn from your
mistakes but it's even better when you
[SPEAKER_02]: learn from the mistakes of others.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you bring on Greenhouse Advisory
Group, you will learn from the mistakes of
[SPEAKER_02]: their many clients and you'll take
advantage of the best practices developed
[SPEAKER_02]: by Eric Brandstad over his years of
working with clients just like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: From location development to choosing a
builder and tricking out your new
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse or retrofitting or rescuing
your failing greenhouse, Eric will help
[SPEAKER_02]: you through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Visit greenhouseadvisorygroup.com to learn
more and connect with Eric and his team.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Greenhouse Advisory Group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is entomologist Suzanne
[SPEAKER_02]: Wainwright-Evans, The Bug Lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's take a one step back to the end
of the last set, Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about the cost associated
with buying these products and I kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: make this, you know, off the cuff comment
at the end as before going to break that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we people in cannabis are used
to paying more for things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it, you know, the green tax,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That we all have to pay a little bit more
for things because there hasn't been a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of research done on a lot of the products
that we need and everybody kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: because cannabis is taboo nature,
everybody thinks they can kind of stick it
[SPEAKER_02]: to us a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But during the break, you're all like,
yeah, and cannabis people don't really
[SPEAKER_02]: know how to shop right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, whoa, now that's an
interesting thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's break that out for everybody to
hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your best practices that cannabis
folks should know about how to shop for
[SPEAKER_02]: these solutions to get the most bang for
their buck?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I find is, well, I call it the
cannabis tax, which just so you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bug Lady Consulting does not charge
cannabis tax on consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I charge the same fee, whether you're
ornamental vegetables or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate that, Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, to me, it's I mean,
and I know I get haters this too,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to me, it's just another crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just another crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's solve the problem and, you know,
move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the economics, so yes,
people think that they can charge more to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry because there's this
idea that they can afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they can because,
you know, price is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's more competition and
growers need to learn to grow without
[SPEAKER_00]: saying to me, it doesn't matter how much
it costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not say that to me because it
always matters how much it costs,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, again, you need to turn a profit
if you want your business to stay in
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I recommend to my growers is that
when you need to buy products,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, let's say, spray products,
you guys all know I'm in love with product
[SPEAKER_00]: SufoilX.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you need to buy a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, don't go just on the Internet and
search and necessarily there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get connected with traditional
horticultural supply companies that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been servicing greenhouses and nurseries
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to have your better pricing
because you're going to pay a premium
[SPEAKER_00]: generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, occasionally you can find a good
price on the Internet, but generally those
[SPEAKER_00]: companies are going to work with you with
these products and get you better pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I mean, I've had numerous heart
attacks over the years looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: biocontrol agents and what some of these
cannabis people have been paying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a sachet that should cost maybe
15 cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen cannabis people paying two
dollars through distributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, again, this always frustrates some
people, but when it comes to buying the
[SPEAKER_00]: biocontrol agents, I think it's important
to attempt to buy them direct from the
[SPEAKER_00]: insectaries because generally you're going
to get the best pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bugs are going to come directly to you
from the insectary and you tend to get
[SPEAKER_00]: better information because those people
are, for the most part, trained on their
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just as in the industry,
there's some, you know, idiots out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, that's where you're
going to get your best information and
[SPEAKER_00]: pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you call and ask for pricing,
because for the biocontrol agents,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are not going to find pricing for them
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a commercial grower or a larger
hobby grower, you know, call them and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, give them your size and say,
you know, this is how much, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're planning on doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that way you can get grower
pricing, not necessarily, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: retail pricing off a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, it's unbelievable some of
the prices that are charged on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these retail websites that are
distributors for biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do your shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that I recognize and
I recommend again to all my growers is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can't do it this year because
everything's canceled this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: but get to, you know, horticultural trade
shows too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you can get connected with
the horticultural, again, professional
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that have been around a long
time that sell at what I call fair
[SPEAKER_00]: pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, no, are all cannabis
distributors price gouging?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is it happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just get connected with, you know,
these, I don't want to say older,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sounds bad, but you know,
it's well established companies that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, can provide you biocontrol
agents and chemistries at, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess I shouldn't have said it that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spray products, fertilizers,
soils and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the biocontrol agents,
I think are a bit better coming direct
[SPEAKER_00]: from the insectary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like too, that a lot of these
companies don't have their priceless
[SPEAKER_02]: online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's well worth adding the extra
step to email them and ask for a price
[SPEAKER_02]: list, even though all of us, you know,
want convenience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause by the time, you know, after the,
after the day in the greenhouse or out
[SPEAKER_02]: outside, by the time you get around to
shopping for this stuff, it's probably in
[SPEAKER_02]: the evening after your dinner and folks
really want a fast solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like what you're saying is
don't just buy from the cheapest
[SPEAKER_02]: e-commerce site that you can find because
there's probably going to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: middlemen there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really it's worth the extra effort to
write to the company, get their priceless
[SPEAKER_02]: or catalog, add that extra step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you'll be creating a relationship
where you'll be paying less for a product
[SPEAKER_02]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, it's one thing if,
oh my gosh, we just need this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay whatever to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if, if, you know,
especially with things like fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're going to need that over and
over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to get some with somebody
that, you know, is, is going to provide,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say fair pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I mean, I just can't believe some
of the, the markups I've seen,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a persimilis I saw online,
I think it was $85 for 2000 persimilis
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can get them from an insectary
for 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a, there's a lot of, there's a lot
of hustling going on in our scene right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, your comment on, on when you need it
fast, you know, sometimes you just have to
[SPEAKER_02]: get it and you'd pay a higher price and
you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was thinking about the same thing
about banker and trap plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, people who are at this point
in the season and they're hearing this
[SPEAKER_02]: episode and they're all like, Oh,
I think I want to add some, some,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, helpful companion plants to
the garden before the season's over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, you recommend,
uh, insightfully, uh, that you should
[SPEAKER_02]: probably start with a seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are growing your own and you know
that it's not bringing in any pesticides
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if people want to bring in,
uh, you know, pre, you know, starts or
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-established plants, is there a way for
that to be reasonably done?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you saying across the board,
do not do this because it's a total mess
[SPEAKER_02]: to try?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a huge risk because I,
you know, I, I needed aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went down to my local garden center and
bought some pepper plants because you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They had aphids on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you could count on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, it's interesting though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when the plants are grown in
densities like that, they have pest
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plant those peppers out and if you put
them in your yard, the aphids are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be gone in a few days because ladybirds
surface, everybody comes in and cleans
[SPEAKER_00]: them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them inside my guest bedroom
window and those aphids thrive to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point you couldn't even see, um,
you couldn't even see the plant through
[SPEAKER_00]: all the aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very interesting because I did,
I went down, bought a bunch of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some in the garden, put some in the
guest room and the ones outside are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, three feet tall and dark green
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones in the guest room are just
encrusted in aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just shows you the difference between
indoor and outdoor growing when just left
[SPEAKER_00]: to its own because outside mother nature
came in and took care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as clean as you think those plants
are, they're going to have something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, alyssum, it can have thrips
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, the, the, generally
outside it will bring in aureus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which helps keep the thrips level below
what we call an economic threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to just buy alyssum and bring
in thrips with no aureus, you bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: into your grow, you close the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen with those thrips?
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers are probably going to go up
and depending on what species they may
[SPEAKER_00]: move into your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why starting from seed,
so they're clean from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, again, it's really high risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, oftentimes when people contact
me, they already know they're in the dog
[SPEAKER_00]: house because they bought plants and they
shouldn't have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually it's, you know, that,
Oh, my neighbor, you know, just needed me
[SPEAKER_00]: or my friend need me to watch these couple
plants for him while he was out of town
[SPEAKER_00]: and poof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why I really push with
commercial growing facilities to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantine area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you absolutely had to bring
either cannabis in or another plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least hold it for a week or two
separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can watch it and see if any pest
problems do develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, for alyssum and pepper,
I would absolutely grow those from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually, um, again, you know,
back to what we do in ornamentals,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is interesting because in
ornamentals, you know what we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We look to the vegetable industry to see
what they do to manage pests and then
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt it to what we can do for
ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what cannabis is doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking to the ornamentals to see
how we can adapt it for that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of us looking across the
fence, um, and developing these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the banker plant systems,
um, were more, uh, looked at for vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the ornamental guys kind of
Shanghai it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the cannabis guys are going to
Shanghai, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look to other cropping systems and adapt
it for our growing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for, um, thrift, cause you know,
I did get a ton of, uh, people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring contacting me about thrips,
especially on the West coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was out traveling in January
and February on the West coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a lot of thrips out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for like the thrips banker plants,
um, whether it, well with the peppers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually start our peppers in winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we start our seeds because we
really want them blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and having pollen and nectar by
February, March, again, depending kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are in the U S and then as soon
as they're blooming, we start inoculating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the aureus, the minute pirate
bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the time, you know, I will say the
Northern region, we'll just talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now wakes up with insects and we
start having thrips issues in early
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already have the standing army of
aureus all ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't start your seeds in springtime
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we actually start the banker plants
before we start our actual crops in
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know there's somebody out here
curious about this, so I'm going to go one
[SPEAKER_02]: more step down this path and say we often
will bring in clones from other people
[SPEAKER_02]: that we've got a questionably clean garden
and we'll do some sort of dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we simply dip these incoming banker
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the same way that we would a clone
or does that, does it not work the same
[SPEAKER_02]: way because there's such a wide variety of
pests that could be on them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so the, the dips again, there's
different dips for different target pests
[SPEAKER_00]: and for things like thrips, the eggs are
inside a plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dips aren't going to do anything for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so just, just to get that out there,
um, you, you can, um, you could dip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'd be very careful about doing it
because like, I don't think there's been
[SPEAKER_00]: any dipping research done on alyssum and
alyssum like grows so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you really, there's no need to,
I mean, you can just grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the dipping could kill the pest,
but again, you don't know if they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with a pesticide, a systemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the really kind of weird,
not weird thing, but most, if you had to
[SPEAKER_00]: go buy something, I mean, you absolutely
had no choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I would probably go to a big box
store and buy them over an independent
[SPEAKER_00]: garden center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I can hear all the haters
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ask why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because the growers that I work with
that sell to big box stores like Lowe's,
[SPEAKER_00]: Home Depot, Walmart, they are not allowed
anymore to use neonic pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: the systemic pesticides, which can cause a
lot of problems with things like aureus,
[SPEAKER_00]: where independent garden centers have no
restrictions on using that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you are probably safer that using,
um, again, something from a big box retail
[SPEAKER_00]: place because they have more restrictions
on pesticide juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm sure I'm going to get some hater
emails saying, well, we're independent and
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't use neonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's going to be independents that
don't, but they don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions on them where the guys that
sell to the big box stores do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work close with a lot of them and I,
you know, we can't use neonics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gone from their programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they've done is they've really
stepped up their biocontrol programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these larger greenhouses I work
with, uh, Metrolinus one, it's 180 acre
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get their biocontrol agents,
um, they're coming on pallets because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using so many of them these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know that one of the things that I
dare say annoys you is that when,
[SPEAKER_02]: when folks see challenges in their garden,
they immediately assume that it's pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've heard you point out
multiple times that we need to know more
[SPEAKER_02]: about diseases too, because more often
than not, it's actually a disease vector
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of a pest vector.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you speak to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I, I, and again, please don't hate
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing this because I'm trying to help
the industry, but you know, the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge level of cannabis growers really
needs to be elevated higher on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on, on, on being more technical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, unfortunately what a lot of a lot of
people do is they look at a problem and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they try to match pictures online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most, I will say that most of the
diagnostic images online for cannabis are
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, everybody's quick to
blame things on insects because insects
[SPEAKER_00]: are more visible where pathogens,
uh, can be a lot harder to diagnose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the time, you know,
I get images and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what's, you know, making these dark
spots on my leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What insects doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What minus side do I spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it's a disease problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for me, I always, it's not my
department doesn't have six or eight legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's, it's, it needs to be
dealt with by a plant pathologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there aren't many, you know,
actually educated, like when I say
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, I mean, like went to college for
this entomologist working in hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are definitely some of us around,
but there's not many, um, and there's even
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer plant pathologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so this is the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get good information,
but there's a lot of guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately people will just post
pictures on Instagram or there's lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook groups and you know, what's wrong
with my plant and I'll scroll through and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see 40 different answers and none
of them are right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you may not be able to diagnose the
problem from the image because oftentimes
[SPEAKER_00]: with, uh, nutrition, you know,
you, you need to send in for leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis to get a report of what's
actually going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in your foliage or in your soil and
you know, it kind of folds into nutrition
[SPEAKER_00]: too, because people think, oh,
we've got insect problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a nutritional problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I talked to people about,
you know, soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, again, agronomy is not my
wheelhouse at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I took it in college and
everything and I know enough be dangerous,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, I'm finding that people
don't really understand, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't know how to do pour through
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: People aren't getting their water tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting their soils tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and granted, you know, a home
gardener who's growing three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, probably not going to,
you know, go through those steps,
[SPEAKER_00]: but anything larger than that,
if you want to become a good grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really need to have good analysis done
to really know what the problem is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you know for the next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me personally, in my career,
the stuff I work with, the insect
[SPEAKER_00]: identification is what I learned in
college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned basic insect biology and that
kind of stuff, but the actual problems I
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with is stuff I faced over the last
30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I didn't know what it was,
an insect or mite, I'd send it off for ID
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I would know the next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've learned through, you know,
getting more educated by using diagnostic
[SPEAKER_00]: labs and help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's going to make you a
better grower not guessing that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what the problem is, but really
finding out really what the problem is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now since hemp has opened up,
you know, through the farm bill and blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, if you collect your insects,
you can send them in and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you don't always have to,
you know, with extension, you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to put what the host plant is,
but a lot of extension now is working with
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can say, okay, these are my pass
off my hemp crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get the proper identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more testing labs that are
doing, you know, hemp leaf tissue analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these places are out there to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the industry needs to take
advantage of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be very interesting
to see the new skill sets that the next
[SPEAKER_02]: generation of cultivators are going to
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the young whippersnappers who
are like in their early 20s and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: hit their, you know, age of majority at
the perfect time when cannabis is coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're able to actually go to
university for, you know, these types of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, diagnostic and pests and
agricultural aspects, and then come up and
[SPEAKER_02]: spend their entire life of cultivating
cannabis with the, you know, professional
[SPEAKER_02]: supports and education and versus those of
us like, you know, me at 50 and well,
[SPEAKER_02]: 49, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those of us who have been doing this
in the dark for so long, we have been
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to, you know, it's felt like
Sisyphus, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to push up, doing this,
you know, the rock up the mountain and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it just has it slide right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to do this without the proper tools
and in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about where to find more
information on these banker plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: trap plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solutions, these protocols that you're
talking about, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they're really unique to bioregion
and they're unique for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: particular species, is there, so for
anybody who's going to give a damn enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to do this extensive research,
is there a good resource for them where
[SPEAKER_02]: they can learn about these programs like
the AFIN program you've been using as an
[SPEAKER_02]: example, where they can learn what the
other programs are for different pests so
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't have to reinvent the wheel?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure, I know these programs exist,
but where do people learn about them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, unfortunately, there's not much
written and the problem is too,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a moving target because things
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you Google like pepper banker plants,
years ago we were using black pearl pepper
[SPEAKER_00]: and then some great research came out of
Europe, I think Gerben Messling did it,
[SPEAKER_00]: where he found that, oh no, wait a minute,
if you use purple flash pepper,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can produce way more aureus than black
pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then everybody's like, change,
okay, now we're recommending this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go back and read older stuff,
it may not be exactly accurate and so this
[SPEAKER_00]: is why it's a moving target of us working
out in the field and honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people like myself, Ron Valentine,
who's with Bioworks, Kelly Vance with
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial Insectary, who are working in
this stuff every day, honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're so busy doing it, unfortunately
we're not writing about it and we're not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, none of us do blogs,
I mean, occasionally we'll spit out a
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine article here and there,
but that's what makes it difficult because
[SPEAKER_00]: most people just want to go to the
internet and do research on it today,
[SPEAKER_00]: where if you want the most current
information, you have to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings where, again, people like myself
or Ron, where we're teaching workshops
[SPEAKER_00]: because those are going to give you the
most what we know today because again,
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations, I gave five, six a year
ago, I know more now and they're not,
[SPEAKER_00]: that may not be accurate today for a
particular situation and so, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing that frustrates me about the
internet is you put an article out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's there forever, it doesn't go away
and people then can get dated information,
[SPEAKER_00]: so always when you're looking at
information, look at the date on it and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure, you know, is this still going
to be relevant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, basic biology, yes, that pretty
much doesn't change, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're smarter today than we were five
years ago on banker plants, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for regionality on banker plants,
you know, we're doing the same programs in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses and you know, west coast,
middle, the United States and east coast
[SPEAKER_00]: because there aren't that many developed
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is more likely to change somewhat are
the regionality of your past pressures,
[SPEAKER_00]: like this year actually it's been a pretty
bad spider mite year where we haven't had
[SPEAKER_00]: big spider mite flare ups in greenhouses
for several years because the years before
[SPEAKER_00]: this, it's been broad mites, so we have,
you know, yearly pests as well as seasonal
[SPEAKER_00]: pests that, you know, make us alter our
programs, but there's not one good source
[SPEAKER_00]: Nestle to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the aphid banker plant systems,
which I know people are interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: because aphid parasites, can get expensive
and again, this program only works for
[SPEAKER_00]: aphidias colmani, which again works for
the green peach and cotton melon aphid and
[SPEAKER_00]: will, we know it does parasitize the
cannabis aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the best place is to get
information from the producers of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all insectaries support banker plant
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pretty clean dividing line down
the line on who does and who doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, Beneficial Insectary is a
huge supporter of banker plant systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them, they work with their
growers with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get them from, you can get
banker plants also from Sierra Biological
[SPEAKER_00]: in New York State and you're able to get
information from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also, I mentioned Ron Valentine
before, he's written several articles on
[SPEAKER_00]: banker plants, but again, watch the dates
because things have changed and I do
[SPEAKER_00]: believe he has some literature that he's
done for bioworks on banker plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure they have that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are places that you can get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're almost better off getting them
from the actual companies that are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there doing and working with it than
necessarily Googling and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also kind of like, you know,
baking a cake back, you know, in 1900,
[SPEAKER_00]: your grandma made the best cake and she'll
give you the recipe, but she's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you that one special ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, why would any of us put all our
information out on the internet and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you exactly how to do everything when,
you know, I've got, you know, being a
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant, I've got this problem with,
in the cannabis industry, everybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: thinks they're a consultant and people
just want my information that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: turn around, resell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing to me how many consultants
contacting me, wanting me to solve
[SPEAKER_00]: problems for their customers that they're
getting paid to do, but they want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: free information for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no way I would put all this
information out for free on the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: because somebody is just going to snake it
and sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to wrap this up, this is going to be
interesting because I normally try to end
[SPEAKER_02]: my shows on a really nice up note,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, this, the, this,
our conversation today has not gone at all
[SPEAKER_02]: as I planned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really thought that you know,
we were going to talk about the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the top five or six pests that
cannabis folk are, you know, mostly coming
[SPEAKER_02]: into contact this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would talk about our, you know,
our best handful of trap and banker plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, people should mix and match
them in their garden or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, it's a lot messier than I
thought it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only the, the quantification,
the development of the protocols,
[SPEAKER_02]: the pre-growing plants, my God,
the, the, the, the charging them in
[SPEAKER_02]: advance with non pest benefit food for the
beneficials that I'd never considered
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a major pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what, what I'm seeing here is that
really for folks who want to go down this
[SPEAKER_02]: path to help decrease their pest pressure,
it's either a some graduate level research
[SPEAKER_02]: that hopefully you will do once
significantly for your, for your grow
[SPEAKER_02]: where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to keep up on what comes
out new every year, but it's, you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: this big upfront research labor time and
then to kind of like build out your
[SPEAKER_02]: program and, or you have to go really much
more hardcore on prevention so that you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't, you know, it takes, you don't
really have to do banker and trap plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not where you're going to put your
emphasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to put your emphasis on,
on prevention, but that is not an
[SPEAKER_02]: inspiring finish to a show, Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, that is not a positive spin on
any of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what do you got for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we end this on a positive note?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just give you this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I guess because I try to be so detail
oriented, maybe sometimes I, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: want people to be successful and I just
want people to be aware of what they're
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you talked to, you know,
some of my ornamental growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's kind of taken them a few
years to really get their stride with
[SPEAKER_00]: their banker plant programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once they got them, they got them and
you know, it, it, it, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will stress that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I said before,
I think maybe 5% of ornamental growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: using banker plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you've got to be the right kind of
person to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that said, if you are dealing with
aphids, whether it be, again, not all avid
[SPEAKER_00]: species, but if you're dealing with cotton
melon or cannabis aphid and you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: aphidias colmani, the simplest,
not cheapest, the simplest thing you could
[SPEAKER_00]: do is every two weeks you can buy in the
barley aphid banker plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you do is you, you get a clump of
barley that's grown, I think it's grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell and it's covered in aphids and
you just go set that in your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got to put some water
underneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will plunk it into a pot and
let it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you release your parasites and
they're flying around, if they don't find
[SPEAKER_00]: enough aphids in your crop, they'll go
reproduce on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it gets more complicated is when
people grow their own aphids, but people
[SPEAKER_00]: will do that for economic savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They buy one aphid plant and then they'll,
you know, in another part of the facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll just basically start a mini aphid
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of buying a plant every two
weeks, they just take a plant out of their
[SPEAKER_00]: aphid farm and set it into their facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the easy way to start would be just to
buy a plant in every two weeks and just
[SPEAKER_00]: set it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be as simple as that, but you have
to make sure that aphidias colmani is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to target the aphid you're dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that will help you build more
parasitoids in your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the long run, you can actually buy
fewer parasitoids paying for the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: buying in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make it a little more unicorns
and rainbows for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not, but it is a good place to
get started because the mountain of
[SPEAKER_02]: research is high and for people who want
to get started with something now,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is a great low barrier to entry thing
that they can start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and that's for indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're outside and actually I do a
whole presentation on this on attracting
[SPEAKER_00]: native beneficials without having to go
through everything, the simplest thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are outside biodiversity,
that is what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just plant biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there is unicorn and rainbows,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow outside and grow a whole bunch of
variety of companion plants all around
[SPEAKER_02]: them so you attract all the natural
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would call them insectary plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insectary plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call, that's what I classify as.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it depends on where you are
because what you grow in South Florida is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be what, you know, different than
growing in Yakima, Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I've done for my vegetable garden
is I have, I first planted all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you know, calendula, yarrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried gumfrina last year and then I just
look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go spend time and I'll just sit,
I have a little plastic stool and sit
[SPEAKER_00]: there and watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who comes to visit it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see things that I want coming around,
you know, surfeit flies, decanted flies,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, boom, I'm going to plant
more of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did gumfrina last year,
nothing ever visited the gumfrina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gumfrina's out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how from my yard I've selected
what plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the Northeast corridor
growing outdoors, Penn State did an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing project in 2005 where they roped
in all these master gardeners and they
[SPEAKER_00]: give them little stools and they sat at
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they measured the number of
pollinators visiting, the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: surfeit fly visiting, the number of
butterflies visiting, and then they listed
[SPEAKER_00]: them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, for me, I want,
you know, all the pollinator and fly
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've pulled from that list a plant
in my yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, generally these plants
aren't the plants you're going to go find
[SPEAKER_00]: down at your garden center because again,
the garden center stuff has been bred for
[SPEAKER_00]: what humans want, not what the insects
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been, you know, digging deeps into
the bowels of buying weirdo seeds and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, pignanthiums, the mountain mint,
are phenomenal for pollinators and
[SPEAKER_00]: decanted flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And decanted flies, go Google decanted
flies to learn about them, but decanted
[SPEAKER_00]: flies are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by doing things like that is how
you can select plants that do well in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you grow one plant one year and
it's like covered in aphids, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we shouldn't grow that one this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you grow like milkweed and it gets
covered with milkweed aphids, those aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to move into your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those will provide food resources for
ladybird beetles and surfeit flies and
[SPEAKER_00]: lacewings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has now turned into a banker plant
in itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that too, because it creates a
sense of momentum, you know, in the,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the cultivation area, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of there necessarily being
happening to be all this research upfront,
[SPEAKER_02]: these are some actions that you can do now
while you're, you know, boning up on the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and this is what I'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look at stuff and then I'll go to the
university and say, Hey, this is what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we work on something, but understand
that these research projects take years
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to happen and it takes money and
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we don't get a lot of the
kind of this research because nobody's
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to pay for this kind of research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully that stuff will come along
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suzanne, thank you so much for spending
time with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whenever I get the opportunity
to hear you at a convention, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's always a fast paced wild ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learn a lot really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I miss more than I even
learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has been the same kind of thing,
high energy, lots of information,
[SPEAKER_02]: the kind of episode that people listen to
more than once.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so thank you very much for sharing
your experience, both the, both the good
[SPEAKER_02]: and the things we don't want to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're invaluable to our scene
and, and thanks for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not only doing the ornamentals and the
other plants that you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: have been bread and butter for you all
these years, but thanks for coming over to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with us in cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, I love working with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say through all of this,
the cannabis got through the, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause honestly, I not been working for
almost three months now because I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what, the cannabis people
have done a good job of taking care of me
[SPEAKER_00]: and contacting me and just checking in on
me.
