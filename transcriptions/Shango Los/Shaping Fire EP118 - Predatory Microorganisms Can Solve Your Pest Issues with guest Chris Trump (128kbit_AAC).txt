[SPEAKER_01]: We have a groundbreaking episode for you
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always my goal when planning Shaping
Fire episodes to offer you insightful
[SPEAKER_01]: information on topics that are important
to you in cannabis, mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: and other entheogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rare, though, to have the opportunity
to present you with a topic that is so
[SPEAKER_01]: far-reaching that it will literally impact
every country on the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's episode is like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we will discuss how to replace
nearly every chemical insecticide with a
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming technique that is harmless
and easy to make.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to episode 118.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Trump is the world renowned master
natural farmer certified student of Master
[SPEAKER_01]: Cho Han Kyu, the creator of Korean natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has also studied microbial analysis
under Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many consider Chris's YouTube videos
explaining Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques to have been the key to KNF's
widely increasing popularity in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is especially helpful that Chris is a
certified kind of educator who actually
[SPEAKER_01]: speaks English.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris has traveled to 10 countries to
teach and implement these natural farming
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques with a passion for reading and
a research oriented approach to nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris has fostered numerous innovations
since he began practicing natural farming
[SPEAKER_01]: on a 750 acre organic macadamia nut farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: He managed with his father from 2008 to
2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: He now teaches natural farming for a wide
range of food crops, livestock,
[SPEAKER_01]: and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris is dedicated to working with youth
and farmers in developing nations,
[SPEAKER_01]: equipping communities with a holistic
approach to natural farming education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently based in Hawaii, he is involved
in large scale agricultural consulting in
[SPEAKER_01]: the US and conducts international
educational initiatives several times a
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through his company, Bio May Solutions,
Chris Trump educates communities of
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming farmers throughout the
world, offering financial independence,
[SPEAKER_01]: sovereignty, and hope through natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris has been a Shaping Fire guest
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: On episode 35, we discussed the basics of
Korean natural farming and its sudden rise
[SPEAKER_01]: in popularity in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chris returned for Shaping Fire
episode 68 to discuss using Korean natural
[SPEAKER_01]: farming foliar and drench preparations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we'll be discussing indigenous
predatory microorganisms, IPMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the first set, we will review the
basics of preparing IMO, how to use it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how to upgrade your IMO to become an
effective pest preventative as IPMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the second set, we dig into the
supporting science and discuss best
[SPEAKER_01]: practices and common failure points when
preparing and using IPMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we finish the episode looking at how
IPMO works with your other farming
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques and how to scale IPMO for large
scale agriculture as well as smaller home
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: While Chris discovered this innovation 10
years ago, he says IPMO is still very new
[SPEAKER_01]: simply because people haven't heard about
it enough to encourage widespread
[SPEAKER_01]: adoption.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is stoked to be explaining it in detail
for you today on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: After Chris explained IPMO to me,
I knew I needed to bring you this
[SPEAKER_01]: groundbreaking technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly if adopted widely, IPMO will change
the reality of farming around the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: including cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Shango, thanks for having me again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so nice to have you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since so much of traveling and so many of
the conventions are gone since COVID and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, and I really miss some of my
goodly cannabis friends like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss seeing you all sorts of places and
being able to catch up all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice to have some time to have a
reason to chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, beyond the podcast, really enjoy
connecting with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to know good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, amen, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's dive right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's going to be a lot of people
who are here because they're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: predatory IMO, but they don't really know
what IMO is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you and I have already done a Shaping
Fire episode that talks about IMO and how
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you have got very popular
YouTube videos that explain every single
[SPEAKER_01]: step of collecting IMO and then up
converting it through IMO 1, 2,
[SPEAKER_01]: 3, 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people who don't know IMO,
this information is available to them at
[SPEAKER_01]: your website, biomade.solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, we need to start out with a
quick run through of IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we talk about how to adapt IMO,
as a pesticide, as it were, we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: give people a thumbnail so that we can
work with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that me asking you to summarize
IMO in just a few paragraphs is
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, will you do that anyway?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you give us a short introduction to
IMO, indigenous microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we get everybody on the same page
and then we can push forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, the IMO is in its best form a
snapshot of the entire community that's
[SPEAKER_02]: existing in a wild place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say wild place, ideally,
this is a multiple generations in human
[SPEAKER_02]: time, undisturbed land.
[SPEAKER_02]: So places that didn't get pushed with a
bulldozer to make a housing complex and
[SPEAKER_02]: now have a nice park with some things
growing in the shrubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: A genuinely established old ecosystem is
what we're going for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a snapshot of that balance that's been
struck over a long period of time between
[SPEAKER_02]: the organisms that causes the life and the
plants to thrive, or maybe the limited
[SPEAKER_02]: life in a desert place like Mojave to
thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go there and we coax onto an auger of
rice because it is a great fungal food and
[SPEAKER_02]: many organisms can dwell there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get a snapshot, a bit of the
bacteria, yeast, archaea, fungi,
[SPEAKER_02]: etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much the macro, bigger organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we put those immediately into,
so step one is kind of coaxing them onto
[SPEAKER_02]: that auger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step two, IMO two, would be immediately
putting them, to borrow a sci-fi term,
[SPEAKER_02]: into cryofreeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: We stop their development, we stop their
replication by mixing them with brown
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The osmotic pressure, the dryness of the
sugar, creates kind of a salt fish on a
[SPEAKER_02]: long sea voyage scenario where things go
pretty stable and can last for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a farmer can have IMO two collections
on their shelf, ready to go to the next
[SPEAKER_02]: step for three plus years without ever
having to go out and collect again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually a really positive
thing for a farmer and their workflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: IMO three and four are growing it out on
substrate, is three substrates that I love
[SPEAKER_02]: right now is rice bran and oats mixed with
wood chips for IMO three and then IMO four
[SPEAKER_02]: is that plus some soil which brings in
some macro organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That complete material that IMO four is
now shelf stable really indefinitely if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kept in a dry cool place and that is
used as a farmer's diverse inoculum,
[SPEAKER_02]: key being diverse, that they can use to
enliven their soil and prevent disease and
[SPEAKER_02]: pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only part that I want to expand a
little bit is for anybody who's unfamiliar
[SPEAKER_01]: with collecting IMO, the idea of coaxing
microbes onto an auger of rice is probably
[SPEAKER_01]: a little vague and I'll tell you a
listener that essentially what he's
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about is taking some cooked white
rice and putting it in a sterile wooden
[SPEAKER_01]: box with an open top and then setting it
out in nature so that all of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in your natural habitat land on
the rice and can start to colonize the
[SPEAKER_01]: rice thus coaxing these microbes onto a
food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a good summary?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rice is falling out of the bottom onto
the ground so there's a little stairway of
[SPEAKER_02]: heaven of food from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You find like a fungally rich area so that
there's literally a stairway of rice
[SPEAKER_02]: leading up into this box of rice and fungi
will grow up in a week time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have some blooms that actually grow
up into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put some in on top and things can fall
through the paper towel that is the only
[SPEAKER_02]: barrier between your rice and the outside
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You clarified that wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for the tech term.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're used to speaking with people who
have some familiarity with it and I just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make sure that we bring everybody
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're trying to do is we're trying to
capture some of the prevalent local
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes and then through this process of
IMO 1 and 2, we essentially incubate them
[SPEAKER_01]: to have them reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got this inoculant that we can use
on our farm or deck patio or even in even
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors in an indoor growing situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the microbes that are popular to
your particular locality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your IMO that you have on Hawaii is going
to be different than the IMO that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: on Vashon Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: It very much captures the sense of place
of the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why that's important, Shango, just last
thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indigenous is important because when you
go through all this effort to get these
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes from across town or up in the
hills around your bio region or just your
[SPEAKER_02]: surrounding area, some healthier place
maybe than your farm is and you get it
[SPEAKER_02]: established in your farm because it likes
that barometric pressure, that rainfall,
[SPEAKER_02]: that temperature, that soil type,
that general region.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's indigenous to there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will self-perpetuate, meaning you could
apply once and 10 years from now find it
[SPEAKER_02]: there thriving and serving your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas when we buy things from a jug that
was grown in the lab, it's well known that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have about six months max that that
will even be found.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't really move these IMOs around
because of the difference in environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we took an IMO that I made here on
Vashon Island, and I took it on vacation
[SPEAKER_01]: to my buddy's place in New Mexico,
our environments are so different than all
[SPEAKER_01]: my indigenous microbe species are probably
all just going to die at his house and
[SPEAKER_01]: vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important for you to be able
to have both in each locality.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yours would perform on that vacation trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yours would perform much like when you buy
a jug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have some benefit on the short
term, but you're not going to get that
[SPEAKER_02]: community that now works for you,
builds on its own, and becomes actually a
[SPEAKER_02]: thriving soil with very little additional
input other than getting plants to grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we got everybody on the same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're already into Korean natural
farming and you already know all this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, I appreciate your patience through
this while we got everybody along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about the primary reason
why we're talking today, Chris,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is taking this IMO and turning it
into something that I've been calling
[SPEAKER_01]: predatory IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard you call it a couple different
things, as far as I'm aware, the inventor
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the term you're using as predatory
IMO, or have you got a different phrase
[SPEAKER_01]: that you prefer?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it IPMO, so indigenous predatory
microorganism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also love the acronym kind of playing on
the IPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: And IMO together, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Integrated Pest Management.
[SPEAKER_02]: The acronym works for me, but it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an intimo-pathogenic fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a predatory or insect-eating fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly in second set, but throughout the
show today, we're going to talk about IPMO
[SPEAKER_01]: in detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to give people a good context
with which to put all of this information
[SPEAKER_01]: we're about to give them in, will you just
give us a cursory explanation of what IPMO
[SPEAKER_01]: does?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then second, the experience that you
had that made you realize that the pests
[SPEAKER_01]: and IMO could be brought together for a
beneficial solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: IPMO, what it does for a farmer,
I'm here in Hawaii at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually was out right before this
interview placing some boxes of IPMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have a client that is the
largest kind of conical coffee producer
[SPEAKER_02]: here in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they deal with a coffee borer beetle,
along with several other pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they hired me to help them overcome
some of their pests and some of their
[SPEAKER_02]: disease problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: What our IPMO has done in the last six
months, they've only been running a
[SPEAKER_02]: program here for six months, they are pest
free.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're cute, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I shouldn't say cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an elderly man, Colombian lifetime
kind of coffee expert that runs their
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee is tickled pink.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is so stoked because when we started,
I told him he wouldn't have to buy all
[SPEAKER_02]: these expensive products.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was buying to try and unsuccessfully
manage his pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now with IPMO, application,
they are pest free and they are tickled
[SPEAKER_02]: pink.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very, very happy clients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I send them my bill,
they are happy to pay it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But IPMO is a fairly low cost solution to
managing several of not all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know if not all is actually
accurate because a healthy plant is also
[SPEAKER_02]: pest resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But IPMO is something that has the
potential to stay established in your farm
[SPEAKER_02]: once applied and give you a reoccurring
resistance to or buffer against really
[SPEAKER_02]: carapace insects or insects that have some
degree of exoskeleton or chitin in their
[SPEAKER_02]: body, which is a lot of our pests that we
deal with, especially since you're on
[SPEAKER_01]: shaping fire and we're primarily talking
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the vast majority of ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've told me the cool story about
where the idea originally came to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you know, I know you've told
the story publicly before, but but why
[SPEAKER_01]: don't you give it to people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a pretty good story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I I started natural farming because we
needed a better way to farm or a more
[SPEAKER_02]: profitable way to farm in one of the most
expensive places to farm in the US,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is Big Island of Hawaii or Hawaii in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our crop is macadamia nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made a scaled natural farming,
made a lab for our 750 acre macadamia nut
[SPEAKER_02]: farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were years into
[SPEAKER_02]: the successful operation of our natural
farming macadamia nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while running our natural farming,
I set it up to be by and large run by one
[SPEAKER_02]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all our natural farming operations were
one person kind of operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing that, plus I had a lot of
responsibilities as a manager.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that to say, and I came to our natural
farming lab and we were almost out of our
[SPEAKER_02]: IMO, which we're using to make a liquid
IMO, a foliar spray of this indigenous
[SPEAKER_02]: microorganism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went to make some more in my
material that the substrate I take that
[SPEAKER_02]: IMO to and grow it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, 200 pounds of fat rich
grains and wood chips had weevils in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My my seed stock, my feedstock had weevils
in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weevils are these little tiny beetles that
get into grains and they're about the
[SPEAKER_02]: size.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're smaller than a grain of rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, no, my grains bad,
you know, and because I'm on an island
[SPEAKER_02]: with limited access to things,
I knew it was going to be like two weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: before I was going to be able to get it
ordered and get down, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: an hour away to pick it up, get back and
make some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was that was going to be a
huge, significant cost because that means
[SPEAKER_02]: our spray program was going to be put
behind by a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with our acreage and just one tea
brewer, 500 gallon tea brewer,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said it was I'm saying all this to
say it wasn't totally just because I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't I was being lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I said, you know what, whatever,
I'm going to make it with some weevils
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And went through the normal process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have all these 12 IMO collections I'm
using to put in their IMO twos and made my
[SPEAKER_02]: IMO three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm mixing it daily, making sure it's
going right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw these like bright white puff
balls showing on the surface of my IMO
[SPEAKER_02]: three.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can still see it in my mind's eye
because it was really striking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done this a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was a total change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at this because I'm curious by
nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the center of these white puff
balls is one of the weevils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're scattered out throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the weevils are growing white puff
balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, wow, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't have time to look into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I continued, finished my IMO,
made a liquid IMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that process of it going out 20 acres
at a time continued.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like a good farmer, I aspired to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked through my 20-acre plot that had
just gotten sprayed the day before or two
[SPEAKER_02]: days before, whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just seeing how the trees respond.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something you've got to check up
on periodically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out on the trees in our orchard in the
crook of a tree, I saw a white puff ball,
[SPEAKER_02]: very similar to what I had seen in my IMO
three.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: I look closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a green stink bug, a little
beetle creature, which is one of our
[SPEAKER_02]: primary pests in macadamia nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that almost took our farm under
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yes, I'm still busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have time to look into a
curiosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now with the connection to what was
happening there and what I'm seeing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: orchard, now that it's transferred here,
I'm like, oh, dang.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did a deep dive of research and
pursuit of what is going on to find that
[SPEAKER_02]: beetles, one of their primary insects of
the whole kingdom of carapace insects,
[SPEAKER_02]: is fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I deduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we know 10 years later or more,
I deduced accurately that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: wildcrafted a predatory fungi and gotten
it to apply on our farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we went down to our orchard where
we were getting now this kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I was like, well, I don't
actually have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just keeps happening now because I have
a whole box and we're spraying it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like, done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our pest problem is going to decrease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kind of left it to,
you know, benefit us passively forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had a friend that needed help.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a locust population descending on
their farm in Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, hey, is there anything
natural farming that will help?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, no, but I did discover this
thing a few years ago and we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing great results and walked him
through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the trials there with it and he had
100% kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the farm surrounding him got
devastated by locusts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a full crop went to all the way
to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing hemp, a hundred acres of
hemp there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he had basically a shield on his
crop that was basically a minefield for
[SPEAKER_02]: locusts of their predator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like filling the tank of piranhas
and, you know, being the, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I dare you to land on my property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's break this out just a little bit
for people so they can see the application
[SPEAKER_01]: in Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had locusts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what your friend in Zimbabwe would have
done would have been to make IMO with the
[SPEAKER_01]: body of a couple dead locusts set upon the
road.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rice in the IMO collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can cook it with the rice inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get a handful of those locusts
and put it in the rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also put insects in the next
stage, that IMO three stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is less likely that you're going to
get what I had happen unless you start
[SPEAKER_02]: with that first step that IMO one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we've kind of, we've kind of
zhuzhed it over the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best practice has been to put your
pest into your rice and cook some.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also put some uncooked in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll cook my rice with some insects in
there, which does smell a little bit if
[SPEAKER_02]: your insects are smelly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll also take some uncooked
insects and toss them in as a topping on
[SPEAKER_02]: top before we put them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really just putting the food source
of the guys we're trying to get to
[SPEAKER_02]: colonize our rice box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying, you're saying, you know,
hey, you molds that love to eat my target
[SPEAKER_01]: pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got you, we've got some of your
favorite food on top of some delicious
[SPEAKER_01]: rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you kind of come over here and
colonize this rice and you can eat of the
[SPEAKER_01]: insect and also of the rice and you can
make this your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then you incubate it from
that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I, then I have it as an inoculum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it isn't guaranteed that where I'm
going to put my rice box with this insect
[SPEAKER_02]: in it, that there is even a predatory
fungi to colonize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the, that's one of the things to
note here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is ends up being a little bit of a
numbers game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you want to put out six boxes in
various locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you can do visually is notice
when a carcass or some carapace insect has
[SPEAKER_02]: a unique bloom on it, or you can really
see that the fungi is chewing on that
[SPEAKER_02]: creature in the collection box,
in the collection box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so visually you can kind of verify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm sure that, you know,
different cannabis cultivators who are
[SPEAKER_01]: listening are thinking about this in
regards to their own local pests,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you are in the country, you know,
you've got different kinds of pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you do a lot of,
you know, general agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you've been helping those of us in
cannabis for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some of the pests that you,
you know, know are good for this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: process that, that affect the cannabis
plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would say maybe it is,
it's best if you can get a, one of your
[SPEAKER_02]: local pests to put in the rice box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also not totally necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some challenge for some people
to get a pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also if you have cannabis, you don't
necessarily want to produce a ton of a
[SPEAKER_02]: pest just so you can put it in a rice box.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things you can do is just
buy insect frass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insect frass is a product that gets sold
as a by-product from insect production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So someplace that produces crickets for
your local snakes or your snake pets or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those, those places will sell their kind
of broken body parts of their,
[SPEAKER_02]: of their prime product in a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can just order off Amazon a bag of
insect trass or pick it up at your local
[SPEAKER_02]: garden store.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be a substitute for using your
own actual pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you suggesting that, you know,
a carapace of an insect, I'm just assuming
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're all made out of chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this is true, you know,
I could use some of my insect frass from
[SPEAKER_01]: T-Lab in my IMO because I don't want to
cause a plant to be covered in,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, mites so that I can capture
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, okay, well I might not want
to breed mites for my, to make this
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide, but if I use, you know,
some kind of other insects frass that also
[SPEAKER_01]: has a carapace that it will cross over to
my target mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, that's really convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't thought about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that actually sourcing some
of the things, especially insects that are
[SPEAKER_01]: so small that we can't even see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and speaking of insects that are so
small, you can't see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And insects that are big enough to see
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also grab insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like maybe you don't have anything on your
cannabis plant, but you're growing some
[SPEAKER_02]: squash outside and there's squash beetles
all over it from, you know, the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could grab a handful of those and
put them on your rice and you're off to
[SPEAKER_02]: the races.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to buy insect frass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to have your exact pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is more that, that tasty protein that
we understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there are things I'm sure I don't
understand about how nature works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so using some of your actual pests
could be best practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would strongly encourage if that's
possible to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use them if you got them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use them if you got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so those of us who have, who have
followed you and your education and
[SPEAKER_01]: learned from you for years, like I have,
we know that you are a student of Master
[SPEAKER_01]: Cho and you are both educated in and are
educator of Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this process fit neatly into KNF
already?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is this more like, yeah, the IMO
collection is, is KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as I added the pest,
we moved on to something else or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or is, or is this like new ground for KNF
that actually fits in that, in that
[SPEAKER_01]: educational family easily?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely not something I was
taught in Korea, nor is there really
[SPEAKER_02]: precedent for it in that education.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it, it's not, I have students and
friends that learned about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow cannabis and they love the
benefit of IMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have for years and learned about IPMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they just do IPMO too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, or not too, they just do IMO,
IPMO because with the insects in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're getting the benefit still
of IMO, because there's a lot of other
[SPEAKER_02]: things that grow in the rice in addition
to the benefit of some predatory fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people that have adopted it
are just doing IPMO now because they get
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am cautious to say that's best
practice because when you add something
[SPEAKER_02]: like cooked insects into the rice,
it kind of changes the nitrogen kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: density of the rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes some things, you know,
depending on the insects you use or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or the stinkiness of the insect frass,
some insect frass is pretty smelly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could really be changing some of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't outright say just do IPMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than IMO, but I do know that
that has become standard operating
[SPEAKER_02]: procedure for a bunch of cannabis farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we go to our first break,
I want to just confirm with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: this seems like there, there isn't any
reason that we couldn't use this indoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like we prefer to be growing
outdoors under the sun and under perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's lots of people who don't have
an outdoors and so they're growing in a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse or, or, or home cultivating in
a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there any reason why we could not
cultivate a local IMO for ourselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, either using, you know,
say for example, spider mites are often a
[SPEAKER_01]: big problem in indoor and throw those in
there and then just spray it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well, like it'd be great to be
outdoors, but we don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually a solution for indoor
cultivators too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Folio folio application weekly is kind of
the SOP for, for yeah, bug free disease
[SPEAKER_02]: free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people cut that off depending on
your region of growth and whether or not
[SPEAKER_02]: you're, you're submitting for testing in
the legal market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some places they're, you know,
parts per million of microbes is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, more strict than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know like Colorado is twice as strict as
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there they'll stop that spray right
before flower, you know, so they'll,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then other places,
you know, like Washington, that they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have quite as strict as Colorado they're
spraying through flower with no negative
[SPEAKER_02]: results, maybe cutting off right before
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it is definitely great for indoor
and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a, a fun bit as an
alternate food source, then there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's this really cool thing that
happens in, in seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: germination, a germinating seed that,
and I don't think I've talked about this
[SPEAKER_02]: much publicly, so just for you,
Shingo, germinating seed in its very
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning of its germination is so like
malted grains, if you will, that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that just beginning of germination,
germination produces chitinase protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right when a seed starts, if you have
it in the ground in nature, it's producing
[SPEAKER_02]: a protein that is good food for predatory
fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a, if a seed is new to the block,
human, we'll just make a human analogy and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're trying to make friends with those
people that would protect them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would, you know, give gifts that
their new friends would like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, sending my five year old to
kindergarten with a box of Oreos,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he's going to be real popular at
lunch time as he shares with new friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a similar way, germinating seeds will
put out nutrients to invite relationships
[SPEAKER_02]: in their root zone that will be there for
their whole lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a seed grows in this wild forest,
as it begins making root relationships
[SPEAKER_02]: with fungi, which is how nature works,
it will then maintain a lot of those
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships as it grows into a large
tree or shrub or whatever seed it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the early stages of its development,
it's putting out this protein that it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't put out any other time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that protein then becomes kind of a
invitation for a relationship with
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's going to protect it from
pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I go out into nature and look for
a good spot to potentially find these
[SPEAKER_02]: predatory fungi, I also will, if I have
the opportunity, look for a place where
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds are falling and germinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there will be an additional food
source for these predatory fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I was just out today placing an
IPMO box and I found a spot that has kukui
[SPEAKER_02]: nuts, macadamia nuts, and ironwood trees,
which drop these little pine cones with
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was seeing on the germinating pine cone
seed, germinating pine cones where the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds are germinating, fungi blooming out
of the germinating pine cones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm like, oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm placing my boxes here,
one, because there's a bunch of fungi
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking for that normal kind of
mycelial mat and health.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also I'm like, in addition,
I know that there's a ton of this chitin
[SPEAKER_02]: protein happening every time one of these
seeds starts to germinate on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, a little bit on how to find
all of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you wanted to grow it out,
sorry, getting verbose, but if you wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow it out in IMO 3, having sprouted
grains could be a way to increase the food
[SPEAKER_02]: source for these predatory fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's interesting to hear
you talk about the locations where these
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know that our IMO collection
is bio bio mimicking nature, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really funny because when you describe it,
my brain said, oh, that's like that's like
[SPEAKER_01]: natural IMO collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, like, no, dude, that's just
called nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and it's very best.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of all of this that we're doing is
just partnering with what with the
[SPEAKER_02]: strength and the power really that is
already at play for the health of plants
[SPEAKER_02]: in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's wrap up first set here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, dear listener, stay with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if this is of interest to you,
stick around because I am going to totally
[SPEAKER_01]: interrogate Chris in second set on the
finer points and how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be a quick short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is natural farming innovator,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire wouldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please support them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let them know you heard them on
Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an all
natural fish poop concentrate with nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real fish poop is extraordinarily complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only are you adding the nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium your plants need
[SPEAKER_01]: to build mass, transport nutrients and
enhance flavor, but fish waste is also
[SPEAKER_01]: packed with biological activity and
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add fish poop to your irrigation
water, you are adding life force,
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotics and active microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These microorganisms include a wealth of
various bacteria and protozoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: which further enhance nutrient
availability for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plants are limited by the absence
of any essential micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_01]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop is a naturally complete solution
that fills in the cracks in your
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer program to ensure you offer
your garden a broad base of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all fish poop is created equally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most products with added fish waste don't
reveal their sources or lab results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fish poop, however,
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_01]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_01]: koi and tilapia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are even invited to tour their farm in
person or on their YouTube channel to look
[SPEAKER_01]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sort of transparency is wildly rare
in the fertilizer market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks behind fish poop are also
lifelong medical cannabis producers who
[SPEAKER_01]: have deep connections in the community,
donate more product than they sell and
[SPEAKER_01]: support cannabis prisoner, veteran and
patient collectives and charities.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get your bottle of pure fish poop,
go to fishpoop.com and to see their entire
[SPEAKER_01]: line of cannabis products, go to
ounceofhope.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fish poop brand fish poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking to home growers, patients and
commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI Seeds at
[SPEAKER_01]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb and Specta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_01]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of his lineage and the hard earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long time heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb, also known as Inspector and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains recreating them in new
[SPEAKER_01]: and interesting ways that you'll love as a
toker and a grower as well as offering you
[SPEAKER_01]: some surprises that will delight serious
seed traders and cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_01]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year here on Vashon Island and
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_01]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack which gave them a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_01]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Businesses everywhere are striving to
reach people through advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know though that trying to reach a
cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product service or brand
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way that really lets people know what
sets your company apart from others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers is essential and that is what we
offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable and help
[SPEAKER_01]: our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising does not have to be all
whiz-bang, smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately and
[SPEAKER_01]: with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot well, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: During these pandemic days, conventions
and cannabis events are pretty poorly
[SPEAKER_01]: attended, but podcasts listening is
skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a commercial on Shaping Fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_01]: of their headphones right now and will
continue to reach new listeners as they
[SPEAKER_01]: explore the Shaping Fire back catalog of
episodes again and again for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A spot on Shaping Fire costs less than a
printed postcard per person and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire audience is full of smart
cannabis enthusiasts, cultivators and
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurs who are always curious to
learn.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is natural farming
innovator, Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the break, we talked a lot about
generally what IPMO is and where it came
[SPEAKER_01]: from, where Chris originally got the idea,
and then a little bit of how to adapt your
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO collection for it and a little bit how
to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're still here, it means that you
actually care about this and welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are about to get real specific with our
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris, let's start with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the inclusion of pest carapaces,
so their outside shell, influence the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial diversity in IMO compared to
traditional methods?
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked a little bit about this in the
first set that perhaps you would recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: doing traditional IMO alongside IPMO
because if you're going to do the version
[SPEAKER_01]: of IPMO where you cook the pest with the
rice, you're really changing the rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like neutral rice that will take
all comers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get a really great
snapshot of the natural world around you
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've influenced the rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you do the version where you
just put the target pest on the rice when
[SPEAKER_01]: you lay out the box, you've got most of
the rice, which is just neutral rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to collect all comers on the
rice, but then you're going to target the
[SPEAKER_01]: molds that are going to be on the
carapace, if I've understood you
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think the IMO might be
influenced if you only did the IPMO?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a really, really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the things to say and help
me stay on track, but before I even answer
[SPEAKER_02]: that, is how important some of the details
of IMO are.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are lots of ways to compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are lots of cool things we can do
with microbial life in farming,
[SPEAKER_02]: but IMO is fairly nuanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of it as a very boutique.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between Jose Cuervo and
absolute top shelf tequila, all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients are similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The process is similar, but one will be
painful when you wake up in the morning
[SPEAKER_02]: and the other will be smooth and might
even nourish your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between IMO and something
where you've changed details is much more
[SPEAKER_02]: impactful than the example I gave there
with tequila.
[SPEAKER_02]: The details matter in IMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between producing a bunch
of bacteria and really giving the
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity for fungi to grow out in a
feedstock or a substrate is just a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much water you use, how much carbon,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now going to adding this other type of
feedstock into that first step really can
[SPEAKER_02]: have an effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we want to do it because we found we
can produce a predatory fungi and have
[SPEAKER_02]: effect on our farm, which affects our
bottom line, gives us a healthier crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely we're here talking about it
because it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were to give you maybe what I think
could be a way that you could,
[SPEAKER_02]: because here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can say you have to do it just
like this, but natural farming,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm constantly faced with the balance
between quality of what we're producing
[SPEAKER_02]: and the efficiency or the time in a
farmer's life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are important things on two sides of
a scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm of the opinion that one of the things
one of the most efficient and effective
[SPEAKER_02]: ways to do good IMO and still do IPMO is
to produce your IPMO second stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put out your rice with your insect
carapace in it and you put it in
[SPEAKER_02]: cryofreeze, metaphorically, with the
sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's inoculum on your shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you make IMO3, that next stage,
you can use some of that IPMO as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: some regular IMO2 rice and grow that all
out together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hinted at a feedstock being in your IMO3
for IPMO to grow out on and I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: that is also a good option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a little bit of sprouted grains or
some insect carapace in your IMO3 can be a
[SPEAKER_02]: great thing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, can totally change it, short answer,
but not too worried about that being bad
[SPEAKER_02]: as long as you have some regular IMO2
going into your IMO3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of hobbies, say for example
baking, it's really important to follow
[SPEAKER_01]: the rules very specifically until you
don't need to follow the recipe anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very ADHD, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fantastic cook, but I'm an awful
baker because you're supposed to follow
[SPEAKER_01]: the directions directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not my strong point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran into the same thing with IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first two times I made it,
I cut corners, I tried to improve on your
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching myself, doing it the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got garbage twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I realized, you know what,
let's just do it the way Chris says the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it and I struggled and I did it
without making any changes and the damn
[SPEAKER_01]: thing worked beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the same kind of thing with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody wasn't very interested in IMO
before, but now that it's a very healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide, if you will, now they want to
do it, I think it brings us back to make
[SPEAKER_01]: your IPMO as intended following the IMO
recipe and adding the target insect all
[SPEAKER_01]: following the directions the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as you get familiar with it,
you'll have more fidelity with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like a baker, eventually you can bake
stuff without even measuring stuff because
[SPEAKER_01]: you just know it that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just recommend that people start by
actually following the IMO protocol
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically because there's so many ways
that seem minor that you can totally screw
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the stuff that we're working with,
we can't visibly see because there are
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes and molds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that whole commentary, Shingo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're dead on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stress enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't change anything at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely particular in a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also love to cook and if I'm going to
bake something, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to learn how to cook meringues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took time, studied the recipe,
played with the details people put and I
[SPEAKER_02]: got to be great at cooking meringues.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit gooey in the middle,
but if you change anything in the recipe,
[SPEAKER_02]: including a dirty spoon, meringues won't
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I love that analogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little detail, if I could make a
request.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't ever call IPMO a pesticide
because it isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a re-enlivening of your environment
to the semblance of nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are actually cultivating life.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not trying to kill anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're cultivating life in such a way that
we actually have the natural balance and
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure that nature allows.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't see complete devastation and
annihilation of all plants due to an
[SPEAKER_02]: outbreak of spider mites in the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because there's the sufficient life
that creates the ecosystem of balance and
[SPEAKER_02]: alternating pressure that causes
everything to perpetuate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there are some things that you can
run into if you start calling things a
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide and you have to talk to somebody
from the EPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I follow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I said pesticide earlier,
you may have heard me even slow down and
[SPEAKER_01]: pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, this isn't the right word,
but I'm not sure what to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like using the IPMO phrase
itself is the more accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not actually bothered by it,
but also we're teaching this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to set people up right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want them talking to people as if
it's a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I know you will get that
you and I would agree on is we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to teach a paradigm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about pesticides and coating
stuff in chemicals and going out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: just kill all of the things, including the
target.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing is we're essentially
encouraging the enemies of our enemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we're not going there and
dropping a bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just sending some help to our
teammates.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an issue, except that we have
governing bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's things with the same name.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we call it a pesticide, there's things
with the same name.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have nothing in common to what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strategically, and I don't know about
ethically, but strategically, a totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were talking about your meringue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use a dirty spoon, it'll destroy
the meringue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that same thing about
collecting our target insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: In preparing for this, I was talking to my
buddies while we were big-leafing the
[SPEAKER_01]: other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about the difficulty or
the challenge with contaminating IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were thinking about ways that we might
contaminate the IMO by contaminating the
[SPEAKER_01]: target pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's use the locust, since we can pick
those up with our fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already been talking about the
locust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you developed any best practices for
collecting the locust, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the spider mite, for example,
so that we don't in some way contaminate
[SPEAKER_01]: the target insect and thus screw up our
IMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about, man, I really think
that when I collect these bugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to want to wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think gloves would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with using gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that might be unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simply wash your hands, rinse them well,
make sure there's not a bunch of soap on
[SPEAKER_02]: them or anything like that would be
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the number one contaminations,
human spring, is a slightly less than
[SPEAKER_02]: well-washed hand after using the restroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough to make people sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add a little E.
[SPEAKER_02]: coli to your IMO.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll liquefy your rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see IMO1 that's been liquefied in
the middle, it is probably E.
[SPEAKER_02]: coli or a similar small fast replicating
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is one IMO collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are like, well, it's so hard to
know what's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colors can be fine as long as it's not all
one color, but one thing I say 100% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: time, you never want to use an IMO that
has gooey middle or liquefied rice or
[SPEAKER_02]: slimy in any part of it because that will
never make good IMO3.
[SPEAKER_02]: Word to the wise, you want to exclude one
IMO1 type as it finishes, one way that it
[SPEAKER_02]: looks that you're like, okay, I know for
sure that's wrong, is gooey middle,
[SPEAKER_02]: slimy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But another thing to avoid quote unquote
contaminating your insects would be not
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing much of their environment or
their poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that happens if you
harvest a bunch of living insects and you
[SPEAKER_02]: leave them in a bag for a couple of days
and they're alive is they will defecate in
[SPEAKER_02]: the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have insects plus all their
little defecation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets pretty funky pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something you can do is clean hands,
throw them in a bag and then immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're done harvesting, throw it in
the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So throw them in a Ziploc, throw the
Ziploc in a freezer, you'll kill them
[SPEAKER_02]: without damaging them and they won't go
through the process of funking up their
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's kind of how I go about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was out the other day in my growing
ginger and I was out there and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting Japanese rose beetle because
they're devastating the leaves and so I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make an IMO, an IPMO and foliar
spray them next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went in there to kind of take off some
of the bits of leaf and stuff that I had
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested because you're grabbing this
beetle off a leaf and then you're grabbing
[SPEAKER_02]: a piece of leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to put that in the rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all alive so they start flying out
of the bag and so I threw them in the
[SPEAKER_02]: freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to point out another thing that you
said that deserves to be hit again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pointed out wash your hands,
sure, but make sure there's no residual
[SPEAKER_01]: soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to double down on that because hand
sanitizer is so much more common too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want any thing that kills
microbes in the IMO box.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a residual soap on your hands,
maybe you use a thick liquid soap in your
[SPEAKER_01]: bathroom, or maybe you use some hand
sanitizer and that stuff leaves a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: residue on your fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you go and you pick up your locust or
whatever and then you put the locust on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of your IMO rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually have put locust and
microbe-killing agents from your fingers
[SPEAKER_01]: into your IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean hands are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean residue of cleanliness is not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'd be no record of cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_02]: The number one reason why people fail to
make, in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: they call it labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: L-A-B, lactic acid bacteria, which a lot
of people use to treat and prevent powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can totally just use liquid IMO
because it already has labs in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but people will send me pictures and
they're like, blah, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_02]: what went wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did all the things you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cleaned my jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, did you make sure that you had no
soap scum left in your jar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you double rinse it?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh, no, probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the leading reason why people's
lab does not develop is a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: soap and you will not produce any lactic
acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your milk will just go funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's precedent for double checking that
you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you have a collection box that
you've made and you cleaned it out with
[SPEAKER_02]: some soap, that can go right into the wood
and now you can have a soap filled box
[SPEAKER_02]: that will inhibit microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baskets that have a bunch of shellac or
coating on the wicker can off gas when you
[SPEAKER_02]: get it warm with microbe development and
that off gassing can wipe out your
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then people go through all this effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm going down the ways that it can
go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are the ways that it can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, people go through all this effort and
then get their rice, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got their, their bugs and then
they put it in a plastic container without
[SPEAKER_02]: any holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these life that starts going in
there now starts breathing and producing,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, buildup of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, then it rots the edges and it'll
fail every time, even though it started
[SPEAKER_02]: great because you had all the right
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the fact that it doesn't breathe will
be enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, some sort of natural material,
um, untreated baskets or, um, I make
[SPEAKER_02]: little wood boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that is really, really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when you're doing your IMO one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, most of us understand
that traditional IMO when it's time to go
[SPEAKER_01]: and apply it, um, we will do a,
a foliar spray, um, uh, over the tops and
[SPEAKER_01]: bottoms of the leaves of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I'm going to guess that the IPMO
is applied the same way as if it was
[SPEAKER_01]: regular IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, IPMO can be applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're making an IMO four, uh,
with IPMO, it can be applied topically.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of, uh, pests have a ground dwelling
phase or at least a phase where they
[SPEAKER_02]: interact.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just having, um, that predatory fungi
in your soil around your plants is enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, to, um, actually, especially if you
can, if you look into their life cycle and
[SPEAKER_02]: they have a ground dwelling phase,
you might not need to ever even apply
[SPEAKER_02]: foliarly to have a hundred percent
prevention in your substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I'm going to guess that fungus gnats
have got a carapace.
[SPEAKER_01]: How awesome would it be to have,
uh, a resident of the soil be the mold
[SPEAKER_01]: that loves to eat fungus gnat larvae.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is accurate and you can
definitely have, uh, prevention from IMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, um, you can have thriving soil in
your indoor living soil bed and over water
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of it, um, and still produce
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I know that is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of, um, surface over watering,
um, because, um, you can still achieve
[SPEAKER_02]: fungus gnats if you try hard enough,
even with great soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try hard enough, you can bring
fungus gnats anywhere, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I got him in my kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so the, you know, I was trying to
think of any downsides to IPMO cause it
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want, I already wanted IMO everywhere
in, in my life and in the nature and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And IPMO sounds great to have everywhere
in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it occurred to me that,
um, I am a beneficial insects user and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, we're natural farmers and
none of us really want to be using
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical pesticides, even if they're air
quotes, natural pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we want to encourage nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I encourage nature by adding the
pests that eat my pest, adding the insects
[SPEAKER_01]: that eat my pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, it sounds like if I'm going to
use IPMO, it's really a one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if the IPMO kills my target mites,
it's also going to kill my beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, um, this is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the cool, the good news is if
you're making IPMO well, and it is killing
[SPEAKER_02]: your beneficial mites, um, you won't have
any mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can, you can have, you can have a
great protocol with total kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's the good news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, another bit of good news is a lot of
these bigger creatures, um, or some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these bigger creatures have, um,
like bees, for example, if you take IPMO
[SPEAKER_02]: and you direct apply it on a flying bee or
a bee on a, on a, um, on a flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can kill that bee.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you apply it, um, all over your
flowers and the bees come, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: the next day, they will have, it'll have
no effect on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we have, um, 140 hives here,
uh, on the farm and, uh, with IPMO
[SPEAKER_02]: applications around their hives to
prevent, um, rove, uh, hive beetle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there has been only positive effect on
our bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our, our hives thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our beekeeper loves our hives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he comes and he, um, splits them or
takes a bunch of bees out of them for his
[SPEAKER_02]: other hives, other places that are
struggling, um, because we're always
[SPEAKER_02]: overproducing bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But however, cause a bee is capable of
cleaning itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are creatures that can clean
themselves and, um, can, can navigate,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, in really healthy soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you, um, and we still have,
um, I don't know how or exactly how it
[SPEAKER_02]: works, but we still have abundance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I think that, um, that leaf
surface, that place where our pests go to
[SPEAKER_02]: eat, um, that soil, um, I, I, I'm not
totally sure of how it all works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, um, yeah, the, the pests are no
more and we still have a thriving
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to push even further on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer might also be that neither
of us knows the answer to this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but I'm going to push anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, that reminds me of,
of, you know, very often, especially early
[SPEAKER_01]: in my cultivation, you know, we,
you know, I used whatever was being sold
[SPEAKER_01]: for whatever aphids or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, mostly I make my own,
um, sauces now, but you know, you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get the sauce and you, you put it on
and, you know, and, and it just kills
[SPEAKER_01]: everything on the fricking planet,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The good guys, the bad guys, the
everybody, which, which creates this
[SPEAKER_01]: environment where they're, there is a,
um, there's a vacuum, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, there's no good guys or bad
guys, which creates an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if, if we sprayed IPMO on our
cannabis plants in veg and it kills all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the insects, good and bad that have got a
carapace is, is, are we creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: weakness in our ecosystem that,
that another type of non carapace insect
[SPEAKER_01]: might be, or I guess it wouldn't be an
insect yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Non, non carapace pest might be able to
fill that space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I have not experienced a
downside here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, um, we have, there's a farm I
helped, um, develop in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in their fourth year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're, um, uh, leading the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in hash, uh, quality, um, and,
um, they have, um, it's like 1800 plants
[SPEAKER_02]: times four or five.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have one building that's times four
and one that's 1800 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So five, and, um, they have a protocol of
just, um, uh, liquid IMO on the regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, they have, uh, thriving like
their soil life, um, has abundance of
[SPEAKER_02]: insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, they don't have pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know why, um, that is the case
that there's can still be, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it may be plant health.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be, Oh, here's something fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the presence of the, um, the protein
of insects being processed with fungi,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, that, um, that IPMO, uh, having those,
those proteins in it actually triggers an
[SPEAKER_02]: immune response in our plants to making
them aware that they may encounter an
[SPEAKER_02]: outbreak of their past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It increases their immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and if you do, if you go really
heavy with that, you can actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you can actually trigger a,
um, extreme fruiting response or flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: in a flowering plant where you'll get an
increase in, um, flower and fruiting just
[SPEAKER_02]: by, um, introducing them to the proteins
and their pests, um, and foliarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can cause them to be,
Hey, I'm going to die soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this outbreak of pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to perpetuate my species by
fruiting, um, uh, in abundance and they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: double down on, um, their, um,
yeah, their fruit production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen real extreme flowering,
um, in my macadamia nuts and also studied
[SPEAKER_02]: this, um, um, phenomenon, um, because of
it, um, and seen it in other crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's really a kind of fun that
there's, um, more than one dimension to
[SPEAKER_02]: all of this and those beyond our
understanding so far as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at what point in the process would you,
um, uh, choose to spray the IPMO and when
[SPEAKER_01]: do you stop?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking for when start,
when stop, and how often?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so if you're, yeah, if your pest is,
um, has a ground dwelling phase,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you're pretty safe to just apply a
solid state IPMO, um, which is a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more expensive per application,
but you don't need to apply it very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, your plant health is going to go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their immune response is going to go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you're, um, dealing with or seeing
the possibility of that foliar,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, um, pest, um, maybe it doesn't have a
ground dwelling phase, then a weekly
[SPEAKER_02]: application, especially if it's already
showing up, a weekly application is kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of the SOP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're applying weekly or, um,
bi-weekly if you want to go serious,
[SPEAKER_02]: go hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if, um, if everything's copacetic,
you know, applying, um, every other week
[SPEAKER_02]: or applying monthly, um, can be a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that a IPMO, if you're worried
about killing beneficials, could be
[SPEAKER_02]: something that you do, um, uh,
as needed or that you do, uh, monthly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, whereas an IMO, a liquid IMO,
maybe where you don't have that in,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, is something I wouldn't worry about at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning you could apply it every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get the nutritive
response.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, um, a nutrient quality in IMO
or liquid IMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of food in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you're feeding them, you're giving
them their probiotics, you're preventing
[SPEAKER_02]: disease, um, by coating their tissue in
beneficial life, which out competes or
[SPEAKER_02]: takes up the territory, preventing the
vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, nature doesn't tolerate the vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So preventing the vacuum, um, which would
allow another, um, something like,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, um, powdery mildew by applying IMO,
you have this protected leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have, in my opinion, as a farmer
that has to pay for things and my bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: line matters, if I can make this,
you know, extremely inexpensive liquid
[SPEAKER_02]: application, um, pest prevention and,
um, plant health, uh, spray, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I get to not pay $800 a box for my
monthly rove beetle or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: then I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's kind of where I've come to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, I also have experienced that the
living soil guys both indoor and outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: are still have thriving, uh, bug
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pill bugs are still going,
you know, um, well, maybe not as much of
[SPEAKER_02]: the pill bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those get eaten too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you're, you're, you're still,
you're still seeing abundant life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, the, um, the indoor,
um, soil in that Colorado farm,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, when I did some, um, uh, soil
analysis, uh, last time I was there,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the most diverse soil samples I have
ever looked at under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been looking under a microscope
at soil and, and media, um, since 2010
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, in a lot of different places and
different places in the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of crops and, uh,
just stuff we put together with compost
[SPEAKER_02]: and IMO applications is the most diverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Material I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it's because of diverse
collections we had every time we did IMO,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was 20 plus, uh, different IMO twos
that went into the batches and really it's
[SPEAKER_02]: self-perpetuated and stayed living.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, I mean, I, I, uh,
yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the, the bottom line is I
don't know the answer to what your
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial, uh, life is going to look
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, uh, how to find that balance,
but I'm down to pursue it with the
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, and yet you've been doing this
for going on a decade and you still have
[SPEAKER_01]: plenty of life in your living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you might not know why,
why it's happening, but you know that it
[SPEAKER_01]: is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're, you're not like nuking any
of these pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're actually encouraging life in these
pots, just not with carapace, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and we're, we're not, we're also
getting, um, you know, we're not,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not seeing aphids or, or things that
aren't carapace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you, do you agree that the,
the time, or I'm just guessing since I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't done this, but is the time to stop
week four of flower like, like most
[SPEAKER_01]: foliars?
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, um, I think if you are not doing,
um, microbial testing, um, microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: testing, um, you know, uh, prevents us
from weird stuff that, uh, builds up,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the dust in a dirty environment
causing, um, uh, a funk to happen,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, or due to humidity, um, proper,
um, decomposition molds happening in
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, um, that can make us sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, fresh applied liquid IMO, a balanced,
um, uh, microbial community with LAB doing
[SPEAKER_02]: the cleanup and all this stuff that,
um, it just means there will be,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, colony forming units.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean, um, that they're going to
make us sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the, um, the right before harvest
or, or a couple of weeks before harvest,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, is, um, as far as like not having
having a bunch of stuff that could affect
[SPEAKER_02]: your flavor or anything, um, would be what
I'd say.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to apply it and then
harvest the next day because without the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant being alive, it's not working with
microbes and you know, doing symbiosis
[SPEAKER_02]: with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the microbes are just there without
the exodus of the plant coming out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, leaf tissue in the mornings,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a thriving ecosystem,
so you don't want to, um, take a hanging
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and spray a bunch of liquid IMO on
it because now you're, you're pursuing
[SPEAKER_02]: composting of that plant, not symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the, the answer is, is kind of like
the same way it is with everything we
[SPEAKER_01]: spray is that when your flowers get thick
enough where you're actually just making
[SPEAKER_01]: them wet and you could be causing molds
and other things stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, as soon as, as soon as the
flowers are going to grab on, to whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: you spray on it and, and, and tuck it away
inside its folds, it's, it's the time to
[SPEAKER_01]: stop spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I might, I might disagree with that,
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, I appreciate that you're bringing
in a concise answer for the listener,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I, I maybe want to leave it a little
more vague because if you have good
[SPEAKER_02]: material, meaning like, um, a,
a actual healthy liquid IMO or good lactic
[SPEAKER_02]: acid bacteria, uh, in going in and you're
watering, um, that's going to actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, often act as a cleaning agent,
uh, tidying and making fresh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that is healthy alive, like our
bigger organisms, they make fresh,
[SPEAKER_02]: they keep the funk away.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you will, they are the prevention to
the bad mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so as long as you're doing it
well, you're not cutting corners.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are in fact, uh, producing a material,
um, then it's really not going to hurt a
[SPEAKER_02]: living plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's going to, um, enliven and help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I have my best friend,
um, uh, he's no longer farming cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he did for 15 years and, uh,
he, he sprayed right up to a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks before harvest, um, on his outdoor,
um, for four seasons or four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and had just amazing, amazing results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Colorado farm has to cut off going
into flower because Colorado is so intense
[SPEAKER_02]: with colony forming units that basically
they're saying you have to be producing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in a sterile manner, meaning you
have to be killing all things or you won't
[SPEAKER_02]: pass our regs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, for them, yeah, cut off,
definitely find a way to pass those regs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for the outdoor Washington farmer,
he's stoked that his plants are disease
[SPEAKER_02]: free and bug free because he, he's got a
functioning protocol and he never had
[SPEAKER_02]: mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's, it's, um, it kind of
depends on your environment and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and really what is the material
producing?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're cutting corners, and you're
making witches brew and calling it Chris's
[SPEAKER_02]: liquid IMO, then yes, I would say
absolutely do not spray that at all in
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other thing, Shango, this is
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you producing a, are you trying to
feed your plants with a foliar spray or
[SPEAKER_02]: are you trying to produce microbes with a
foliar spray?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're putting a bunch of food in
your um, to make tea and you're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: break down that food, so it's plant
available, that is now compostable
[SPEAKER_02]: material, unprocessed nitrogen,
unprocessed nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those getting into the crevices of
your flowers now need to compost or be
[SPEAKER_02]: further broken down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will can putrefy on your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so if you're, so this is my big
clarification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a food tea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it a microbe tea?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing a really great job and
it's really lightweight, meaning you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not putting a bunch of foods in it,
it's just for producing microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, there's no buildup.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're putting a bunch of like food
stuff, like you're adding these things
[SPEAKER_02]: that people say are a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that goes on, it's not fully
processed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to process on your plant
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe that, that I've,
I have interviewed so many people about
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying nutrition foliarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has never come up that this,
this, this nitrogen residue on the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to eventually compost on your
plant and, and create a funky ass
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, uh, might as well go to commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to be able to top that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, uh, let's, uh, let's continue this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we come back, uh, you are listening
to shaping fire and my guest today is
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming innovator, Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_01]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack that can be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so many varieties in one pack is a
sign of an immature seed line that hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: been worked enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer my auto flowers to be worked
enough that each pheno in the pack really
[SPEAKER_01]: captures the aspects that the breeder was
intending.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I recommend gnome automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_01]: automatic flowering cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gnome automatic seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_01]: recognizable by its traits, traits that
were hard earned so that you can have your
[SPEAKER_01]: best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last 10 years, gnome automatics
founder, Dan Jimmy has become a trusted
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder and he continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_01]: variety he releases for you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the gnome automatics Instagram
at gnome underscore automatics to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can score gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_01]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercial cannabis farms across the
country love growing gnome automatics
[SPEAKER_01]: because of their consistency from seed to
seed, short grow times, THC percentages
[SPEAKER_01]: and colorful bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farms interested in bulk seeds of more
than a thousand should reach out through
[SPEAKER_01]: gnome automatics dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: While on the website, be sure to check out
the gnome automatics shirts and other
[SPEAKER_01]: merch section too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want reliable seeds, hand built
from effort, expert selection and
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, choose gnome automatics.

[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you to follow at shaping
fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_01]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host Shango Los and my guest
today is natural farming innovator,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Chris, during the break I was thinking
and you know, I got me wondering if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to spray the IPMO on our cannabis
plants and the allied fungus that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: working with is on the plant and and then
it kills these pests, whatever they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they turn into little fungal puff
balls like they did in the IMO that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this going to leave like little puffy
carapaces all over our plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you have a major outbreak of a
pest and it is all over your plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: in some way you're going to need to get
that off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so hopefully you have enough time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're doing foliar watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, insect buildup in a
sticky flower is a bad scene, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bad scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even even overuse of ladybugs is a
major problem for people as far as buildup
[SPEAKER_02]: goes or as far as insect residue and can
cause real problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overuse of human beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, the excuse me, the the puff ball
is going to be a really short lived bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that will fall apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and as far and the insect itself,
if it has been predated by a fungi,
[SPEAKER_02]: the insect will fall apart much easier or
or dissolve more likely to happen if it
[SPEAKER_02]: has encountered a fungi that that attacks
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're probably in a better scenario if
they've been killed, first of all,
[SPEAKER_02]: than if they're all there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be easier for some
degree of, you know, shaking off or foliar
[SPEAKER_02]: wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds to me like there's like there's
like three layers of of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, number one, IPMO is going to be
far best used as a preventative because
[SPEAKER_01]: then you don't have to deal with all of
the adult pests fuzzballed and having to
[SPEAKER_01]: clean up the evidence.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do everything as a preventative is
going to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our secondary is that,
oh, I've got an outbreak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm experiencing pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you, you know, you're using it as
a foliar and maybe even as a soil drench
[SPEAKER_01]: if they've got a soil period of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, hopefully they will,
you know, fall, fall off the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's in veg for you or maybe you're
picking them off by hand, something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but at least they're dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then your third version is you've got
an outbreak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got spider mites that are building
tents on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just about being a big kid and
realizing that plants got to be removed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really you're you're trying to save
the rest of the crop by getting rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: these pests so that they don't spread and
or put down like serious anchor roots in
[SPEAKER_01]: your cultivation location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, you know, is this spray a panacea?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you if you use as a preventative,
but if you're using it after you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your pest has already taken over your
plants, the plant very well may be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, you know, be mature about what you
expect the the IPMO to do versus how
[SPEAKER_01]: colonized your plants are with the enemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the IPMO like process takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're in like freak out,
you know, take over, you're you're
[SPEAKER_02]: probably not going to want to spend a
couple weeks, three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, getting all set up to be
spraying IPMO if you haven't started yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: not to mention learning curve,
if you've never done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let alone if you haven't made it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is this is definitely something
as, you know, integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, you're you're these
are these are things you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is my IPM for this coming crop year?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that is the right way to go
about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does work to kill things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't isn't isn't that what's all in
in those vape carts, Shango?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, they're all they're all they're
all filled with like spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Lord, there's a place for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone will buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dear Lord.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, you know, you might not be able
to get a solution as fast as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: How what what is the the protocol cycle,
if you will?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are using IPMO for an outbreak,
clearly the preventative starts at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but if if you're coming to this
because you've got an outbreak,
[SPEAKER_01]: how like let's assume that I already have
the IPMO already made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's say that I'm starting to do
light foliar today.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long should I expect it to take for
the fungus to take up colony and to start
[SPEAKER_01]: munching on all my pests?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you have a total outbreak and
irrel, regardless of what your pest is a
[SPEAKER_02]: and this you do in fact have a actual
IPMO, then you can apply it every four
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: For in three applications would be like a
full cycle kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so if you have different there's
different life cycles on different pests,
[SPEAKER_02]: but hitting pretty much the across the
board pests, if you apply it every four
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, that's not right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once a day for four days would be every
pest would be hit in their adult or in and
[SPEAKER_02]: then and then you can take a break of
three days and do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eight applications over a period of 11
days would be like I have I'm really
[SPEAKER_02]: worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it on my shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the beginning of an outbreak.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure we get everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apply it every day for four days and then
give it a three day rest and then do it
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be kind of your whole gambit
of pests killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see any benefit in doing like a dip
maybe or a heavy foliar for incoming
[SPEAKER_01]: clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I say so the again back to SOP for
natural farming using liquid IMO provided
[SPEAKER_02]: you're making it well is once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once a week through veg a lot of
natural farmers are adding the veg formula
[SPEAKER_02]: would be adding in that FAA fish amino
acid or that real rich highly plant
[SPEAKER_02]: available nitrogen that doesn't need to
compost on your leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that nitrogen we talked a little bit
last segment about how these like
[SPEAKER_02]: unprocessed nutrients have to go through a
processing phase even like fish
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrolysate or fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been blended.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been chopped up really fine,
but there's still a uncomposted fish
[SPEAKER_02]: particle that will now land on your leaf
and need to process there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whereas FAA went through the belly
metaphorically of or literally of a
[SPEAKER_02]: microbe completely processed and now is
the processed version of that same
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient, the amino acid kind of form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really doesn't have any more
processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be taken up or passed through that
tissue into the plant as is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that that you do in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a regular weekly application of liquid
IMO would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe every other week or every
week you're putting in the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't brew with nitrogen in the liquid
IMO, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also it may be that we're not getting a
ton of replication of IMO in the water
[SPEAKER_02]: column.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry, I'm rabbit trailing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shingo, should we stop and clarify?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm going to I think that we
have made that point really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to ask you the follow up
question, which is, do you see any reason
[SPEAKER_01]: why we can't target more than one variety
of pest in the IMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it possible that we're collecting
the IMO and, OK, we're going to put,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pest one in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also have a problem with pest two in
my area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to put that pest on my
rice as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to have a double duty IMO
or or are you more of the line of no,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, no, no, one IMO per pest and then
rotate them through a great clarifying
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you put one carapace insect in with
rice and it gets colonized or gets chewed
[SPEAKER_02]: on, that is your broad spectrum IMO
complete, meaning there is not another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that doesn't mean that you can't do
potentially better by having your locust
[SPEAKER_02]: and your beetle both in your rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, maybe it's a, you know,
that one fungi really likes that that
[SPEAKER_02]: beetle flavor, you know, soft drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but really, it's it's not a lot
of these entomopathogenic fungi are broad
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you will, they they they go for kind of
whatever has that protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time it when it passes them or
they blow by on the wind and land on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is going to go after whatever it
finds that has that protein has their food
[SPEAKER_02]: source.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you want to add multiple
pests to your rice, you can't you find.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, the picture, the context is
bigger than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's not that, oh, I want to target
pest one and target pest two, because the
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO isn't targeting the pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's targeting chitin, which is what the
carapace is made of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the our partner fungus is
concerned, they're the same pest because
[SPEAKER_01]: they both are carrying its food around on
its back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's a seed in early germination,
it's the same food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be really tempted to actually
spray germinating seeds or or or even just
[SPEAKER_01]: like just after germination to spray them
with the IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that it replicates as the plant grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, or or even better, you put the seed in
soil that's been treated with I.P.M.O.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, even better.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thriving ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is what nature is doing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then the soil is already housing
our partner fungus, plus all of like its
[SPEAKER_01]: helper, you know, you know, biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and it's well established at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start building I.P.M.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: into your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, that's a great addition to a soil
recipe right there, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've already hit on this,
but I want to make it really clear for for
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody who still has this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I.P.M.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: plays nicely with all the other forms of
Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make that nice and clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have I what do I still have that I
haven't here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so, you know, this show is about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but but but most of us who grow
cannabis love cultivating plants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I am definitely one of those
people that cannabis was a gateway to food
[SPEAKER_01]: farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for most of my life,
I've just been growing this one plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this special relationship with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, as as as we saw,
you know, access to food get questionable
[SPEAKER_01]: there a few years back, I dove into food
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that we can use on
on all of our food crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there is there any crop that you have
come across where this is not a good idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty broad question about I
just asked you, but yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I I I have worked a bunch in the
cannabis industry, but most of my work is
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of my work is with food farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I cannot I can't see a downside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we're not doing anything wild in as
far as nature goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're we're just taking something that's
already there and and making sure it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: on our crops that we're growing,
because sometimes when we are growing
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever it is we're growing, we've tilled
it and it actually used to be lawn or we
[SPEAKER_02]: actually bought it in bags and brought it
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there hasn't been the
establishment of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, we're we're not afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say I will bring I think if I can
maybe take liberty with your question and
[SPEAKER_02]: go a little more broad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will give a caution that I think is
really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate the trigger or the the
nudge.
[SPEAKER_02]: We we are collecting microbes without
specifying our collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in in natural farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing a a broad a broad invite by
putting out this food and by getting it
[SPEAKER_02]: from different places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally, we have a bunch of different
places we've got our microbes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're further cultivating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we finish IMO three, it dries out
and is really almost like a powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I look at it under a microscope,
what that powder consists of is a bag of
[SPEAKER_02]: marbles that's packed with fungal spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in an ideal, you did really great,
great job making IMO three under a
[SPEAKER_02]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that it's all dried, we've used up all
the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have desiccated fungal bodies,
meaning they ran out of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they sporulated, they pushed their
nucleus into a fruiting head and made a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're now sitting there waiting to be
reintroduced to water so they can wake up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all those spores are great for the
forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they we have made a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like if you have a new cannabis
smoker and you're you're about to
[SPEAKER_02]: introduce them to your dab rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say now this is concentrated maybe
more than nature would normally give you
[SPEAKER_02]: on your first toke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, take it easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a super concentrate of fungi and
fungal spores specifically in an IMO three
[SPEAKER_02]: or an IMO four that's dried or a liquid
IMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there, though it's safe,
I've drank my liquid IMO now throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the year for 12 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've bathed in IMO and eaten IMO too any
chance I get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know many people that have.
[SPEAKER_02]: IMO is really just, if done well,
a replication of a forest floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That said, sorry, long, long lead up to it
can be overly concentrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Concentrated for an immunocompromised
person, you know, to breathe in,
[SPEAKER_02]: to inhale a massive amount of microbes,
albeit beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the reality is that good microbes can
have a negative impact on a person in
[SPEAKER_02]: various, you know, how much anything isn't
great, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so we have a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just I think a general caution that
you are producing a massive quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your your the the goal with IMO three is
that we're really we're we're multiplying
[SPEAKER_02]: again and again to produce our microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a friend, Poncho, he's on one of my
videos on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't talked to him in a while,
which is definitely my fault, not his.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he can't be around IMO three or four
production that dust gets in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's you know, he's a longtime rocker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was crazy horse, Neil Young,
crazy horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for whatever reason, that is put him
in a state where he starts breathing that
[SPEAKER_02]: he itches and has a like a autoimmune
response, you know, whereas I have no
[SPEAKER_02]: negative effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think just in general,
though, I'm not so worried about a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am concerned that we just be beware for
humans, especially elderly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have encountered two or three people in
my whole journey that IMO makes them itch
[SPEAKER_02]: and and they're all, you know,
over 50, over 60 humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and so, yeah, just that's the that's
the big caution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for the long winded explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But well, at least we at least we
understand why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'll even throw this in there
is that even though people drink their
[SPEAKER_01]: their preps to kind of like prove a point,
you know, it doesn't matter who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be wearing a mask when
foliaring this type of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: because just because you can drink it does
not mean that it plays well in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, any time doing foliar,
if it's not just water, it is well advised
[SPEAKER_01]: to wear some sort of mask.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I think it goes back to what
did you actually produce?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it go well?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I'm making it, I feel safe,
you know, to to breathe it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but yeah, if you're making it for the
first time or you tried something new or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, yeah, it's just a general,
you know, take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's our last question, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to take I want to take you a
step back from all the stuff specificity
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have had today and and and think
about the student who is considering I.P.M
[SPEAKER_01]: .O.
[SPEAKER_01]: for the first time and has just listened
to all of the details that we have given,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, moving moving from different
types of science to different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: like processes to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they've experimented with I.M.O.,
maybe they haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but maybe they're they're probably
feeling, you know, a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelmed with like, I really want I.P.M
.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: But holy F, there there's a lot of science
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet we want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to support them because this is
this could really radically improve their
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation or their farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's my question for you,
handing you the mic for a nice,
[SPEAKER_01]: nice dismount.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice would you give to someone just
starting to make an experiment with
[SPEAKER_01]: predatory I.M.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: in the garden to to help like,
I don't know, to soothe their nervousness
[SPEAKER_01]: about the complexity of it and to kind of
like assure them that that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: fricking do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in eight days from listening to this,
you can foliar a liquid I.P.M.O.
[SPEAKER_02]: and and have it be 100 percent exactly as
I would do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's really doable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be using your I.M.O.
[SPEAKER_02]: to to make a liquid I.M.O.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you basically get a natural material
container, you know, like a box and cook
[SPEAKER_02]: some rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have a fun bomb to drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shingo, you inviting me to do a I.P.M.O.
[SPEAKER_02]: interview inspired me to make a I.P.M.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: how to know that's fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not have all this science we
talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept it super truncated and short.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, is that is that on your
YouTube channel?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be I literally just finished
the last portion of it this morning before
[SPEAKER_02]: we jumped on the call.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was maybe going to be late.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got stuck in the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but no, it's yeah, going to be on my
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be by the time they're listening
to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, it is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it'll it'll it'll take you
through just the practical.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't have to watch it to take the
interview and go right into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally rice cooked al dente placed just
like an I.M.O.
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that succeeds, mixing it with brown
sugar, taking a handful of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: putting it in a sock or something within
air stones because these are aerobic
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms and brewing it for 24 hours and
spraying it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will have your I.P.M.O.
[SPEAKER_02]: foliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and the the downside is is really not
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as long as you go through that
process, you're going to be putting
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful nutrients again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to return to something we said
in earlier in the interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just can't say enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not ad lib.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not do not shoot from the hip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not come up with your own I.P.M.O.
[SPEAKER_02]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where because that's the only
way you go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just try and hone in on what we're
talking about and how to do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I love about natural farming,
I am I'm a super nerd in this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to know all the science to
follow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to follow a recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to understand every detail
and hold all of this in your head and
[SPEAKER_02]: heart to have the benefit for your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to be good at doing step one
through four and literally just experience
[SPEAKER_02]: the benefit or experience the outcome of
what nature is already doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nature, I love that it is more complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Than we understand or than our
understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, you don't have to
know a darn thing about the complexity of
[SPEAKER_02]: nature to walk up to an apple tree,
pick an apple and eat it and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is good feeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate that that summation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's like you don't you don't
need to know everything in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need enough to do the recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very similarly, like, you know,
I don't know how my everything functions
[SPEAKER_01]: in my car, but I can totally drive and,
you know, I can I can learn how to fix
[SPEAKER_01]: different parts of my car as I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so, Chris, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you you educate people all
around the world and you've been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this a long time now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're certainly an ally to the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and just thank you for for the time
that you spend with those of us in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then most specifically, thanks for
spending your valuable time with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here today so that we can learn more about
I.P.M.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I when I stumbled across it three
weeks ago, I was like, holy crap,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe Chris and I haven't talked
about this already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so thanks for freeing up your schedule
to be here with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely Sango.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, thanks, listeners, for for the
time you put in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got this far, I think you deserve a
round of applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, dear listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you would like to know more about
Chris Trump and more, maybe even more
[SPEAKER_01]: importantly, his videos, I'm going to give
you three places for you to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is his website for his business,
Biome, which is www.biome.solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Biome is B-I-O-M-E-I dot solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that sounds weird to you,
like it is his URL is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dot solutions.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's www.biome.solutions and and your
browser will get you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so on the biome website, you can find
out about Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get access to all sorts of
resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the free classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find about upcoming free and paid
classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are resources for how to make
the various natural fermentations that
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris has been teaching about all these
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, there are links to the YouTube
videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so like a big one win there at at at
www.biome.solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if if if you want something like,
you know, on the regular, you can also
[SPEAKER_01]: follow his Instagram at biome solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's B-I-O-M-E-I dot solutions is
his profile there on IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then if you're interested in
following Chris for you know, Chris
[SPEAKER_01]: himself as a human, as he travels around
the world and teaches different farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: and and and you know, learn some of these
new innovations that he's coming up with
[SPEAKER_01]: like first before they even become
classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you want his personal Instagram,
which is soil steward,
[SPEAKER_01]: S-O-I-L-S-T-E-W-A-R-D, soil steward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can follow Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris reads that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, there's an entire community.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a, you know, thirty five
thousand followers or something on his on
[SPEAKER_01]: his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a really nice place to to learn
and also to to interact with other people
[SPEAKER_01]: in our community who have who have got the
best of intentions is a very well well
[SPEAKER_01]: behaved place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great place to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's at soil steward on Instagram.
