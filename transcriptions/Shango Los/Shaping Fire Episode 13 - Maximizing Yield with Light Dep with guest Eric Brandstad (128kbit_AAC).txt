[SPEAKER_00]: Forever and ever, the cannabis plant was
only grown outside under the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it became increasingly prohibited and
then demonized totally for the convenience
[SPEAKER_00]: of some American politicians, cannabis
farmers had to move to more clandestine
[SPEAKER_00]: areas and then eventually indoors under
artificial light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor cannabis cultivators and renegade
outdoor farmers kept the spirit of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis alive during those dark years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continued to study the botany of the
plant sustained its medicinal traditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and hybridized its traits to develop some
really amazing genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that cannabis has been able to come
out of hiding, smart commercial growers
[SPEAKER_00]: are blending the power of growing under
the sun with the best practices of indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing resulting in greenhouses of all
sizes that incorporate light deprivation
[SPEAKER_00]: technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light dep is a strategy that uses blackout
material to cut off sunlight from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in order to fool them into thinking
that it's fall and they should start to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's exceptionally common in
many places now, the first you hear of the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea as a grower, it's truly mind blowing.

[SPEAKER_00]: Today's guest on Shaping Fire is Eric
Branstad, co-founder of Forever Flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses based in the Emerald Triangle
of Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric is a longtime cultivator and has
become one of the most, if not the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important voice in light depth
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk to him about
just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Eric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Shango, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're obviously going to
talk about light depth today, but let's
get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with the incredible boom in
cannabis greenhouses all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you're traveling all over the
place, setting them up and consulting with
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm just seeing everybody trying to
find their place right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like the shift is really,
really going towards greenhouses more than
[SPEAKER_01]: ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I guess 10, 11 years
ago, I mean, I started with this company
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years ago and so it was really stuff
and envelopes and trying to show people
[SPEAKER_01]: what really light depth greenhouses are to
the point now where people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: know what they are and they know what they
want to get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just are fishing around for which
company at this point to go with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the green rush has always been kind
of happening in my eyes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: being on the front lines, answering phones
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not quite been the same kind of
rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's always been the green idea
for over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's the full on green rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually, we had Dr. Dominic Corva
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you know, everybody says that
now that California has legalized that the
[SPEAKER_00]: green rush is coming to California,
he says, people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green rush started in California in
the 70s has never stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that dude knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like him a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can agree with that sentiment
because California really, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: has been the Mecca for outdoor cannabis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, being up in the Emerald Triangle
and Humboldt County and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people have always been moving
there or moving up to northern California
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, to get away from something
or just to get up north.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people originally,
when I moved up to Humboldt in 1992,
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of people that were there
were either lagers or people that
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanted from southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was still a lot of tight knit
California people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really a lot of, you know,
most people that had set up shop in
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt back in the early 90s that had
been there a while or that were fairly new
[SPEAKER_01]: to the area were mostly southern
California people from what I found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's to the point where people are
coming from all over the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've even seen people from other
countries that are, you know, in
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations or belong to certain groups
or families or have ties or whatever that
[SPEAKER_01]: are now, you know, trying to be in the
Emerald Triangle as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the California in general now,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as much as the green rush used to be
northern California, I think it's safe to
[SPEAKER_01]: say that it's the generally speaking
California is seeing the green rush all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just so people don't pigeonhole you
as just being doing greenhouses in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, where around the country have
you been, you know, let's say in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: six months building out greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you're doing lots of work in
the new medical states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have greenhouses going up as
far away from here as Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's pretty much,
you know, coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you know, we have greenhouses going
up in Arizona, Maine, a lot of the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: states for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say in all of them,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm still working on some of the
other states that went legal, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's other greenhouse companies to
choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just us, but we have been
advertising nationwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do trade shows, you know,
as far away as New York City will do one
[SPEAKER_01]: in Boston this fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I speak at a lot of those events.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, you and I like to meet up at
a lot of these events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you're probably the number one
cannabis keynote speaker in the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as I'm concerned right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like your pitch anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean the commonplace of you,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people want to know about light
depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are moving away from indoor and
towards, you know, light assisted
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses or light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you're just a friendly dude
who gives a good talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, everywhere I go,
I already see that you're like giving the
[SPEAKER_00]: keynote or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I really like to, you know,
I guess speak about the light depth
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses and cannabis production,
you know, first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I've been doing it so
long, I start to, you know, get on a rant
[SPEAKER_01]: about some of the topics or these things
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a lot of passion behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't mind getting up and
talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be pretty nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still get really nervous about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I enjoy getting out there and
getting the message across.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people enjoy, you know,
hearing it sometimes because I come from a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty authentic side of things rather
than a textbook, you know, possibility
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of dreamers are going on
out there and a lot of people just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: into the industry and they do have some
credentials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really speaking on a background of
10, 11 years of, you know, the business
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then previous to that, I was a kid
running around in Humboldt and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's turned into data in some way
or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I've got a bunch of
questions for you, you know, about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, modern light depth greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, even though those of us who
are already in the industry talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: light depth all the time, there are still,
you know, the majority of people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the idea behind light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you kind of like, you know,
get a little old school and talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: early techniques for light depth so that
when we talk about the greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: people will see, oh, I see how you've,
you know, it used to be a cardboard box
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's a whole building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people that are,
you know, into the industry, getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry and other states and places
that just aren't familiar with what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might have heard the terminology,
but they don't quite know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, light depth is
basically, you know, I sometimes like to
[SPEAKER_01]: compare it to indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people understand indoor growing
techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also look at outdoor growing
of corn, let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you plant the seed, it doesn't
automatically, you know, give you corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta wait till the end of the summer,
which is the shorter days.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the days naturally get shorter,
cannabis plants and a lot of vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: crops come into season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as fall comes into season,
we have the harvest time for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different crops, but especially cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And years ago, people, you know,
if they didn't grow indoor, they had to
[SPEAKER_01]: wait till Mother Nature pulled the trigger
so that you could, you know, get the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers and harvest, you know,
at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to beat that cycle or to
do that, indoor was one way to do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the other way to do it was to,
you know, cover up the greenhouses or
[SPEAKER_01]: cover up the garden in some way or another
with a tarp or the earliest methods were
[SPEAKER_01]: the cardboard box.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called it black boxing in 1992 when I
lived up in the Humboldt area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd actually take a big cardboard box
that was the size of a refrigerator box or
[SPEAKER_01]: a washer and dryer, and they would
individually cover each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea was just to go out in the
evening time before it got dark and
[SPEAKER_01]: encouraged darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were actually forcing the darkness
on the plants without waiting for Mother
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by putting the plants in the dark
in June at 530 in the afternoon or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever time it would be, the plants
flowered and so people would actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to harvest before everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that time, the product was
terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really was something that,
you know, I don't think too many people
[SPEAKER_01]: were proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: They quick dried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just not the best product,
even though it was available early when no
[SPEAKER_01]: one else had anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now when we jump light years ahead
into these greenhouses that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one can be manually pulled tarps,
you know, over a hoop house or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: and two, the automated version,
the real goal, you know, people are able
[SPEAKER_01]: to use these greenhouses and get up to
five harvests a year using the sun versus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just being indoors using
electricity, getting the same amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, but the overhead is a little
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the outdoor grower that
plants the seed or brings out the clone
[SPEAKER_01]: and it flowers when it flowers due to
Mother Nature's forces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that being said, it doesn't
take away indoor use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, indoor growers still exist with
the light depth greenhouses because in
[SPEAKER_01]: some cases you have to veg the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people that are new to
cannabis in general, too, plants grow with
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 hours of sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't produce flowers or fruit with
that much sunlight or available light
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors or outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only until you cut the lighting back
to 12 hours on and off, 12 hours of light,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 hours of darkness, the cannabis plants
will flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really easy to do indoors
when you have a timer, but it gets a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more tricky when you're outside
dealing with the sun because if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have enough money for an automated
greenhouse, you got to pull some tarps or
[SPEAKER_01]: manually cover the greenhouses or that
outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've developed ways over the years
to help make that easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are still
do-it-yourselfers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also offer the automated
greenhouses now that you can set a timer,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like the indoor growers set a
timer, but we're setting a timer for our
[SPEAKER_01]: curtains to close because we can't turn
off the sun, but we can choke it out with
[SPEAKER_01]: these light depth curtains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the ways that I found out a
lot of people were new to this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: experience is I jumped on another social
media site called Reddit recently and did
[SPEAKER_01]: a few posts and it was amazing how many
people had no idea or hadn't heard of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't even believe it was true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was kind of, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun to be around a lot of people
that hadn't had the experience or have
[SPEAKER_01]: known about it before because that's how
small our community is within this big
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're talking about different levels
of experience too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the people who are all new to
it who are, A, blown away by just the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they realize that they can get
more than one crop a year, which blows
[SPEAKER_00]: their mind when they start running the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got folks that have been
doing light depth, but they've been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it the back breaking way where you're
using tarps and you're hand pulling tarps
[SPEAKER_00]: and that works and it's smart,
but that's a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the problem with pulling tarps
is that it gets very cumbersome and it
[SPEAKER_01]: gets difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what people tend to do is try to
make gadgets and things and make working
[SPEAKER_01]: smarter, not harder happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's always pros and cons to all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not something I can get into
in seminars and presentations that I go
[SPEAKER_01]: over, but there's a lot of people that are
just kind of not putting the layers
[SPEAKER_01]: together properly with these greenhouses,
especially in the summertime, that causes
[SPEAKER_01]: the product to either not come out how
it's supposed to or just isn't as
[SPEAKER_01]: manageable as people wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then they give us this idea that
the only way to do it is with an automated
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse if you're gonna get into it in
a commercial style.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if people have that
notion, sometimes they're not getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do recommend a lot of times that
people do get a basic hoop house that are
[SPEAKER_01]: just getting into this and get some of the
easier mechanisms that we offer to pull
[SPEAKER_01]: tarps because, and I'm not talking about
everybody and all the investors,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to get a good grower, to know what
they're doing and to really learn the
[SPEAKER_01]: craft, it's not that big of a deal to pull
some tarps for two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take some of the profits from
that extra cycle that you did and upgrade
[SPEAKER_00]: your material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into that though,
and what a modern light depth greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna look like, let's go to our first
commercial.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is Eric Branstad,
co-founder of Forever Flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we were talking
about the history of light depth and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that you can get more cycles per
season if you're covering up your crop for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the time, kind of fooling the crop
to think that winter is coming and it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to pop up those flowers all of a
sudden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, most people are thinking
about commercial production and light
[SPEAKER_00]: depth now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's a real range of
options you know, you can get a hoop house
[SPEAKER_00]: and get some technology to pull a tarp or
all the way up to having, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a super sexy custom built greenhouse where
everything is automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric, would you kind of like give us an
idea of the range of solutions of light
[SPEAKER_00]: depth so that different folks can kind of
consider what might be the option for
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is ranges of ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, originally people were trying to
do their outdoor gardens and so they were
[SPEAKER_01]: just getting a cheap platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they were just using plastic and
rigging up some kind of mechanism,
[SPEAKER_01]: wires or you know, it became that's why
hoops got popular for light depth because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was able to hold up a black tarp and
keep it from, you know, laying on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was like, oh, well,
this hoop is kind of handy because if it
[SPEAKER_01]: rains, I can put a piece of plastic over
it and I'm not going to get my plants
[SPEAKER_01]: rained on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for a long time, it was kind of
like, you know, a lot of people were just
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to do light depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then up into the Emerald Triangle,
we get a lot of rain towards the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can get rains that are a week
before harvest even that can be fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at one point, the greenhouses were
popular for the weather part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people had the greenhouses and
were like, oh, well, I heard of this light
[SPEAKER_01]: depth thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could maybe pull some tarps or do
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there became a whole range of
people interested in light depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it had to do with budget
concerns, maybe the size of the plot of
[SPEAKER_01]: land that they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have little hoop houses that are
16 feet wide and only 12 feet long that
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody could essentially stand on a
stepladder and pull a tarp over the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of it without really too many
gimmicks or gadgets.
[SPEAKER_01]: That same greenhouse can be, you know,
144 feet long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets a little bit more difficult to
pull that tarp over the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do offer some solutions to make it
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's other companies that make
certain mechanisms that help pull the tarp
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit, but it's really tricky to
get automated ones because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: automated options on the really low tech
greenhouses become more expensive than the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual frame or the hoop itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you're better off just trying
to pull tarps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people go, well, I got to
have a life or I don't, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a lot of reasons why they can't
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of the reasons are is because
people imagine the times that they pull
[SPEAKER_01]: their curtains are much like an indoor
time would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is indoor growers
typically like to run their lights at
[SPEAKER_01]: nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so lights might come on at seven in
the evening and turn off at seven in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning because the nighttime air is able
to keep things cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Historically, it was also the time that PG
&E used to come around and read the meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so nobody wanted their meters spinning
a hundred miles an hour when PG&E was
[SPEAKER_01]: looking with their binoculars from the
driveway to your meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so running the lights at night was
always the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we have people that pull their
light depth covers from seven and evening
[SPEAKER_01]: and uncover at seven in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with that is that you got to
be there at seven every night,
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't the hugest thing, but people
have games and kids and stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also the factor that
you're suffocating those plants for 12
[SPEAKER_01]: hours under that tarp.
[SPEAKER_01]: People used to go out in the middle of the
night and burp the greenhouses by pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: up the fabric and letting the hot air kind
of escape.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that means you got to get up in the
middle of the night and then you got to be
[SPEAKER_01]: up at seven in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And historically when my doing this,
cannabis growers weren't always up at
[SPEAKER_01]: seven in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so uncovering the tarps, it was just,
I'm not doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became really aggravating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the product was very inferior as well,
like I was saying in the earlier segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things I learned along
the way was that we can pull our tarps
[SPEAKER_01]: according to how much sun is available in
the morning and the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I mean by that is that when
the sun comes up in the morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants start to wake up at a different
time than when we see the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our eyes pick up color and things that
the plants really don't pick up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have eyeballs like we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the plants actually wake up,
it's a little bit more light out than one
[SPEAKER_01]: would think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the best way to gauge that is to
use a light meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by going out with a light meter
like a photographer uses to measure the
[SPEAKER_01]: lux, you can actually sit out in the green
out by the garden early in the morning as
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it registers from zero to
whatever number, it could be one or it
[SPEAKER_01]: might jump to 15, you know that it's light
and the plants are awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at that point, we know in 12 hours
at time, we need to cover those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of times, the first lumen at
my garden would be 525 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had to be at my garden at 525 in
the evening to cover them up because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was 12 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people go, but it's still
sunny out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still, you know, but tough luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 12 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to get people to be able to
deal with this manual concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea is to make sure that you
cover them at 530 with a white exterior
[SPEAKER_01]: cover or 525 PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the white exterior cover helps reduce
the heat gain that can be associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: a black tarp.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people would use a black tarp
because it's cheaper and easier to find,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it encourages more solar gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the last thing we need when
we're covering up a cannabis garden in a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse when it's 525 in the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what that allows you to do is uncover
the plants the minute it's dark and you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to be out there again until 525
the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're basically talking about
covering the garden at dinner time and
[SPEAKER_01]: uncovering at bedtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go out there and look when the
last lumen disappears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically that's before the sun actually
goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't need a flashlight to go
uncover my greenhouse because it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: dark enough for me to see, but it's dark
enough for the plants to be asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a tough pill for people to
swallow, but it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can go by that regiment,
a lot of people are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one thing I would say to that low
tech method and that idea, it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable, but you need to use the
greenhouse properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so backing up to greenhouses,
like we talked about a little bit in the
[SPEAKER_01]: other segment is that greenhouses were
made for winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you think about that,
that means, well, we don't want to use a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's partially true because
greenhouses can actually trap too much
[SPEAKER_01]: air, heat up, and it makes people have to
do things like turn on fans and maybe want
[SPEAKER_01]: an air conditioner and all these other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a hoop house, in my opinion,
it gets even more low tech because we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really need exhaust fans and all
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually make the greenhouse more
of a shelter rather than a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I like to differentiate summer mode
and winter mode greenhouses as two
[SPEAKER_01]: different things because the way we run
them in the winter is not how we run them
[SPEAKER_01]: in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a simple hoop house doesn't need to
have end walls and doors or fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can merely just be an open tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I like to have the sidewalls up
off the ground at least three to four
[SPEAKER_01]: feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, we're really creating a
canopy or a shelter so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we avoid the solar gain and the
greenhouse effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also use the proper greenhouse
cover, which is a diffused poly woven
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse cover and diffusion,
high diffusion spreads the light uniformly
[SPEAKER_01]: so that it actually doesn't have hotspots
that causes the plants themselves to heat
[SPEAKER_01]: up because plant temp and air temp are two
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can have high air temp and still
keep the plant temps low through this
[SPEAKER_01]: method that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we pull our light depth
cover at 530 in the evening, we don't see
[SPEAKER_01]: the humidity spike like a lot of the other
cases that we hear about because people
[SPEAKER_01]: have been trapping air too much,
using too clear of a cover or even using
[SPEAKER_01]: the black ground cover and black grow
bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those things encourage more surface
temps, which add more air temps to the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we want to do is calm down all
these things and use white ground cover,
[SPEAKER_01]: tan grow bags, a diffused greenhouse
cover, stop trapping air and we're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: summer mode greenhouse and cannabis is
going to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to pull your light depth
covers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to see the humidity and
condensation that everybody else,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the horror stories that people
talk about a lot of times because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: just not quite putting the layers together
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the low tech version can be very
profitable for people and low overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually works for a lot of small
craft farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we go into the mid tech
greenhouse, we're talking about the Gothic
[SPEAKER_01]: shaped greenhouses that can be manual
sidewalls and ridge vent or automated with
[SPEAKER_01]: an automated blackout option.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be basic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be deluxe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of ways to skin
the cat in the Gothic frames we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the ultimate
greenhouses, the A frame greenhouses that
[SPEAKER_01]: really, you know, when you're looking at
them from the front, they straight
[SPEAKER_01]: sidewalls to a A frame peak and they can
be gutter connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they create a mega structure and you've
got all these different bays with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, vegging and flowering and,
and, you know, they're really commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: like full on, but they're very expensive
and you got to have the right property and
[SPEAKER_01]: permitting and all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas some of these low tech,
mid tech greenhouses are fairly affordable
[SPEAKER_01]: at entry level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can learn the craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a lot done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pull the same type of product out
of a low tech, mid tech and high tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you follow some of the
procedures that I had talked about,
[SPEAKER_01]: and on the mid tech greenhouses like the
Gothic, you don't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: stripping it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we talked about in the hoop house,
because the Gothic frames allow you to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a roof vent on the top that it goes
from one end of the other that's four feet
[SPEAKER_01]: wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you open that roof vent and then
these Gothics have six foot tall sidewalls
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can roll up manual or automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you have a six foot sidewall
rolled up and a roof vent open,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can still leave the end walls on and
the doors secure and you have a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: flexibility that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point you also have a timer
for your curtains and you can basically
[SPEAKER_01]: throw away the idea that I taught you
about manual light depth and go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: even the seven to seven thing that your
indoor growers might've been used to
[SPEAKER_01]: because you get so much sun at your garden
all the way till seven in the evening or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you pull your curtains and that way
your curtains on these automated systems
[SPEAKER_01]: are breathable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can have the exhaust system
with the light traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them breathable walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the exhaust fans and intakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even when the blackouts closed,
the zone isn't going to heat up because we
[SPEAKER_01]: have all this breathability and you can
open the curtains again at seven in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning when the greenhouse is practically
getting into full sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, there's the manual mode,
I guess, or strategy to do it and the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer strategy or the automated strategy
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately the goal is the same to
avoid the solar gain in the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: not have significant colors that are
encourage more surface temps and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: we use the right greenhouse cover and
everything will be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like how you clarify or lay out
rather the buffet of options, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the very base level,
I mean, you can just use your muscles and
[SPEAKER_00]: a tarp and boom, you are decreasing the
light and you are causing your plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower much earlier in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, bam, you are doing light
depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you want to then upgrade and
start thinking about how much extra heat
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're keeping in your greenhouse and
change, you know, the color of your pots
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you're putting on the ground and
allowing more ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're doing light depth, but you're
also helping the plants because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do, you know, all of these inexpensive
techniques just on color choice of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be helping you not retain
this too much heat during the summer so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can still do your light depth in
a greenhouse in the summer without cooking
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, if you've got serious
investment capital, well then yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can step up and, you know,
maybe get something custom built where now
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got all the best practices worked
out together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just depends on what your budget is
and what you want your experience to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you can kind of work your way up,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As you're getting more cycles and being
able to make more profit off of the new
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles that you're having, you can take
some of that money and reinvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, in just a few cycles,
now you've got a totally sick year round
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're absolutely right about that too,
because a lot of people call me and go,
[SPEAKER_01]: what should I do or how should we scale
up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best plan here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously the goal is the mega
structure for a lot of these investors,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they got plants that are, they've
already got seeds popping right now and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like, you know, it's hard to
get stuff and build it and have it ready
[SPEAKER_01]: to hand you the keys and the amount of
time it takes for some of these structures
[SPEAKER_01]: or some of these setups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might even be that the property is not
ready and the grading has been done and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these other things that don't even
have to do with the manufacturing or the
[SPEAKER_01]: producing of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people are also investing
in a lot of properties right now that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, need fencing and they need power
upgrades and they need, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they need infrastructure and stuff to even
support a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: A processing facility, drying rooms and
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that being said, it's pretty
easy to get some of these hoop houses and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for a lack of better terms,
bang them out real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you're saying, you can encourage
a couple, you know, you can encourage
[SPEAKER_01]: revenue while all this other master
planning is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, you might pull tarps for a
round or two while the mid-tech or
[SPEAKER_01]: high-tech greenhouse is being built,
but it's better than just being sitting in
[SPEAKER_01]: the water, you know, sitting dead in the
water, not doing anything, waiting for the
[SPEAKER_01]: megastructure to be built or permitted or
whatever it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I see a lot of people with wasted
time and space and things go by because
[SPEAKER_01]: they are hung up by red tape and the way
that they see they want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times that's the automated,
all the bells and whistles where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, most growers are fine with the
low tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always somebody around that can
pull some tarps or, you know, it's easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: hire someone that's strong and can do this
type of stuff for a couple of months or
[SPEAKER_01]: even a season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes also to the equipment that
we buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of people, you know,
we went through a really harsh winter here
[SPEAKER_01]: in California, particularly, and I think
up and down the West coast for rains and
[SPEAKER_01]: snow and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I get a lot of phone
calls now that the sun's out, we went from
[SPEAKER_01]: zero to a hundred and people are needing
greenhouses yesterday and they keep asking
[SPEAKER_01]: me, well, I need a heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time a lot of people buy most
of these greenhouses and actually get them
[SPEAKER_01]: installed, I doubt that they're going to
turn the heater on much because we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: trending towards spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the other thing people
automatically by default want to buy are
[SPEAKER_01]: lights for the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, we're going to be
needing curtains more than we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: need lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can maybe need lights for vegging,
but you know, a lot of this equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: people buy and it stays turned off for
four or five months where they could have
[SPEAKER_01]: used that cash for something else because
they're still growing in that greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make some cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold that purchase off until the end of
October after you crop the natural summer
[SPEAKER_00]: crop and then buy that stuff with the
revenue that you've pulled from the three
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles that you already have done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing, you know,
we want our heating systems and our lights
[SPEAKER_01]: to be in the greenhouses and ready,
let's say by Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always say that's a good goal
to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can pop off around or two
before Thanksgiving and whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even in the main greenhouse,
you can still add the lights and that
[SPEAKER_01]: heating system during harvest season for
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also kind of the goal of Light
Depth is to make sure you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting when everybody else is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're able to bring that
product to market first, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a lot higher price than everybody else
who is bringing their product to market at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, I want to talk a lot more about
transitioning to a light depth situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's take another break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Eric Branstad, co-founder
[SPEAKER_00]: of Forever Flowering Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into something as
deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there is more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage loyalty in the customers you
already have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you certainly don't have the time and
you're not ready to hire someone full-time
[SPEAKER_00]: for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend blunt branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blunt branding principles, Kirsten Nelson
and Anthony Garcia are focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is pretty much the most important
part of marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and Anthony will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale and keep them coming back to you
and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with blunt branding on three
projects now for various clients and every
[SPEAKER_00]: single time they have done more than they
have promised and over-delivered on
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making me a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every friend I've referred them
to has come back to thank me and that just
[SPEAKER_00]: does not happen every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grab a pen and paper because the
website address is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_00]: give blunt branding a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_00]: while using cutting edge technology in the
background that make all of this easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic and trackable.

newsletter, Blunt Branding, marketing that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Lowe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our guest this week is Eric Branstad,
co-founder of Forever Flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first set, we explain light
depth and why it is totally bad ass to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to add multiple cycles to your year
instead of just growing one outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second set, we talked about the
variety of technological solutions from
[SPEAKER_00]: really simply pulling tarps all the way up
to quarter million dollars, sexy,
[SPEAKER_00]: fully automatic greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a lot of people, we don't know what
we don't know in moving towards that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eric, my first question for you is
because of prohibition, lots of people
[SPEAKER_00]: have been indoors because they need to be
both clandestine and also they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: control their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these indoor growers,
they've kind of earned their master
[SPEAKER_00]: growers stripes and now they're being
hired by a commercial company who's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to use a greenhouse so they can start
using the sun more.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the hints that you have
for indoor growers that are moving to a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it kind of falls back to our
last segment of getting a low tech
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and learning the craft because
basically that's what's happening is that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have really great and successful indoor
farmers or growers that are put in the
[SPEAKER_01]: place of either consulting or maybe even
hired or their own businesses converting
[SPEAKER_01]: to greenhouses because economics and
that's just what's penciling in now for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody is not to shut down the indoor
per se but to add greenhouses to it or
[SPEAKER_01]: even the outdoor isn't working out because
we got rained on last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either way, everybody's circling the
wagons around greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I find has happened from
prohibition, it's not just that everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: was indoors because of prohibition and
that's what we had to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that a lot of books were also written
on the craft of how to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's happened is is if you think
about it, most farmers and families that
[SPEAKER_01]: have big commercial farms and things like
that, it's a family operation and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: passed on through generations or you're
married into the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people that you see growing
cannabis weren't pepper farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't plan on growing anything and
probably weren't farming business
[SPEAKER_01]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis became into their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it became legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us pre-legal, we just liked
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one reason or another, we grew
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of people were green thumbs is
all I'm saying and cannabis made them
[SPEAKER_01]: become it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you become a green thumb
specific for one crop and you grow it
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically one way, you're probably
gonna read all the books about how to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: it the best that way and become the great
farmer or indoor grower that they become.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not because they read all the
books also and that's just how they
[SPEAKER_01]: learned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They read the books to quantify things and
made a lot of mistakes along the way and
[SPEAKER_01]: learn the craft overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that is the thread
in all of that or a correlation in all of
[SPEAKER_01]: those things is that indoor growers have
parameters and these parameters are
[SPEAKER_01]: basically 75 degrees air temp and let's
say 35% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a standard parameter for an
indoor grow room, especially a newbie.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were getting into it, you'd say
this is the air temp and you wanna keep
[SPEAKER_01]: your humidity low.
[SPEAKER_01]: To avoid PM and bud rot and all these
things, and so yeah, we're starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about a controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we talk about a controlled
environment, that's what we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're controlling the environment,
the temperature and the humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: how often we water, the light levels,
all these things to one, mimic mother
[SPEAKER_01]: nature and two, to control the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you don't control mother nature
in that setting, let's say, if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: become mother nature, you're gonna lose
control of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you lose control of the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if it gets too hot, not enough
water, too much light, all these little
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters change.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants get sick, they take on disease
and pests and they die or you don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So following the parameters has always
been a safe bet for everybody along the
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that correlation of those
parameters, I guess you could say,
[SPEAKER_01]: people go, okay, we're getting into
greenhouses now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanna bring those parameters with us
because that's how cannabis grows,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, this is how cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I have people that bring me the
books.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have people that email me the paragraph.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have people that come to me and say,
this is how it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how it grows indoors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoors is the key word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not how cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we have to do is retrain these
people to realize that there's outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: growers all over the United States or
Northern California or whatever for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time that have been growing out in the
full sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't have the same parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't tell an outdoor grower in
California in the summertime to turn the
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor temperature down to 75 degrees and
lower that humidity in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those plants need to be way more
rough and tumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably where, I mean,
that is where indoor plants, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been super hybridized,
get kind of a reputation for being wimps
[SPEAKER_00]: if you take them outdoors because they've
been babied like Olympians for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You move them outdoors where, oh man,
we had an especially cold night or,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh man, we had a fricking hot day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor plants are burly, rough,
and ready for that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your parameters can get a lot
wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what you said in the second set,
it sounds like the best solution for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody transitioning from indoor to
maybe just having their veg indoor and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a light depth cycles outdoors in the
greenhouse would be to start by just
[SPEAKER_00]: getting yourself a small hoop house and
just pulling that tarp with your arms and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a cycle or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of get it down because a good
indoor grower is gonna understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: changes and the variables really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like they're starting over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting over with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that they're expanding their
scope of understanding of how she can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, essentially read as
much as you can from other people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully doing light depths so that
you can make sure that your greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't get too damn hot during the
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean, a lot of people that are
doing light depth aren't quite doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: right in the sense that most of the people
that I talk to, I'm actually, when they
[SPEAKER_01]: come here or even call and ask me about
greenhouses, a lot of times they ask me
[SPEAKER_01]: about a dehumidifier and a cooling system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so back in the day, I used to just go
into my regular typical, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's how we do it and this kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I do now is I
stop and I actually kind of interview
[SPEAKER_01]: these people a little bit more to get a
little more background in the sense that,
[SPEAKER_01]: are you just familiar with indoor growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you just familiar with outdoor
growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been in a light depth greenhouse
before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you have your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you've been to one before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times the common thread is,
is it gets really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets condensation drips and I have all
these situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I need to get a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get this cooling system or
backup and get all these defaults.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it almost gets to be like the indoor
idea in the sense that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: control this environment to the sense that
we're getting it to these parameters that
[SPEAKER_01]: might not be achievable in the
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the greenhouse because we're outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons I say that is
because we don't have typical air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning systems for greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: An HVAC system really doesn't work in a
greenhouse because mathematically they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't figure out the tonnage when the sun
is bearing down on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those real good AC guys tell you,
put a shade over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put a canopy, put it in the shade,
I can try to run some calcs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the sun's beating down on a
greenhouse that has a cover that lets the
[SPEAKER_01]: sun inside, that essentially has solar
gain, they just can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though people try a lot of
times, it's gonna cost them a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember we got into this because we
wanted a green house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't want an energy house or back to
the indoor room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a greenhouse to go green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's not add a typical AC system
to it because it's just not gonna work and
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle off and cost a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we talk about greenhouse
cooling systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a greenhouse cooling system?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a evaporative cooling system or also
known as a wet wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically that's when water trickles
over a pad much like a swamp cooler and
[SPEAKER_01]: fans are at the other end of the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only entry point is through that
pad with water trickling through it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: other end of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so instead of intake louvers,
you have water trickling over a pad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have the exhaust fans at the
other end of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water's pulled through that pad or the air
is pulled through that pad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's got moisture,
the first set of plants are getting more
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity and more cooler air than the
plants at the other end of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing about evaporative
cooling systems is they only work in
[SPEAKER_01]: places that are really hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in the Emerald Triangle and
some places in Oregon, the coast areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: upstate New York even or the Midwest
South, the South, you're not gonna be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to use an evaporative cooling system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea that you're gonna get to
these parameters just went out the window
[SPEAKER_01]: even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people have a tough time
swallowing these pills that I'm giving out
[SPEAKER_01]: and saying that it's best to avoid the
solar gain, use the right greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean avoid the solar gain,
I mean don't trap air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we trap air, then we have to do
something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like I said, when people come here
to meet with me, I usually ask them about
[SPEAKER_01]: their greenhouse experiences from their
friends or themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times I get down to the nitty
gritty of, okay, you've been trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: trap air, you've been trying to do
something about it, like use exhaust fans
[SPEAKER_01]: or things and it's not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even evaporative cooling system in an area
that's got high relative humidity outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not getting that temperature drop
but it's getting way more humid inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using too clear of a cover and too
clear of a cover means you get more sun
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the leaf surface temperature
rises.
[SPEAKER_01]: When plants heat up, not just the air
temperature, when the plants heat up,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to sweat to keep cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can get a plant temperature
that's higher than the air temperature or
[SPEAKER_01]: the same temp as the air temp,
which is a higher temp and the plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: sweating to try to keep cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the greenhouse has become very
humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the default of the cooling system
isn't working or not applicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other default is to get a
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those typically don't always work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the real big industrial
dehumidifiers that you can get are pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive and need three phase power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why I try to go back to
saying, look, the person that's meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: with me or talking to me about these
things, we really got to look at what the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant needs, not what the environment
needs because we're out here like an
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using a greenhouse that was invented
for winter time and we're trapping air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouses are ideally designed to trap
air and have these clear covers to have
[SPEAKER_01]: solar gain and heat up the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I like to back up and go,
okay, we're cannabis growers using these
[SPEAKER_01]: apparatuses in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't want to trap air and we
don't want to have to use a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity in order to mitigate
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the best policy, like I said about
in the earlier segment is to avoid the
[SPEAKER_01]: solar gain and not trap air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on hoop houses, we're leaving the
ends off and maybe rolling up the sides
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the Gothic frames, we're having a ridge
vent and rolling up the side walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even in the mega structures,
we can have double ridge vents and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that to help avoid the solar gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, we're also using the
proper greenhouse cover to spread the
[SPEAKER_01]: light, uniformly diffused covers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're also not using those
encouraging colors that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people are here visiting me on
site, I use my infrared thermometer and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have all these things set up on site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you've watched some of my live
feeds on Instagram and other things,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll actually go out in the greenhouse and
I'll shoot the leaf surface temperature of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll open the door to the greenhouse and
within 30 seconds, you can see the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature drop dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can really see firsthand that
air temp and plant temp are two different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll shoot the black ground cover or black
swatches that I have in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: next to the white swatches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the indoor growers or a lot of the
people that are trying to learn about the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse craft that have the parameters
stuck in their mind, and this is how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis grows, really soften up a little
bit and start to understand that yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is outdoor growers and they do it
outside in a hundred degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's this greenhouse thing
over here and they're saying not to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: control the environment, but to support
the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supported is what I like to say by using
the right things that we've talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: in colors and so on to really support the
plant so that we don't have to control
[SPEAKER_01]: this environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The environment becomes supporting enough
that the plant can grow to its fullest
[SPEAKER_01]: potential and not overheat and cause sweat
and humidity and condensation that
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody always sees with their other
setups or their buddies or the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: As they got before, because if they
haven't dealt with us, they've dealt with
[SPEAKER_01]: another company that really doesn't look
out for cannabis first and foremost,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they maybe know about cannabis and
they're trying to take shortcuts and not
[SPEAKER_01]: have people use ridge vents and cheap
plastic that lets in too much sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, they're just
not getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I really try to lay it out there so
that people really get what we're saying
[SPEAKER_01]: and laying down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was on the phone with a hydro shop
owner that I've known for almost 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: now and he has his own greenhouse and he
has really never heard what I'm saying as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as we've hung out, as much content as
I put out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on the phone today and we zeroed in
on a couple things and he was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of those things that I just
keep trying to repeat myself in creative
[SPEAKER_01]: ways and I'm thankful to you, Shango,
for having me on this show to let me
[SPEAKER_01]: spread the same message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me, hearing you talk about it,
it sounds a lot like when I talked to Ted
[SPEAKER_00]: Hussey from Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always talking about building living
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his point is like, don't dump a whole
bunch of NPK bottled salts into your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that you're going to give your
plant what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a microbe community in the soil so
that the soil can just be itself and will
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally give the plant what the plant
wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, you seem to be describing the
same kind of environment where,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen, if your greenhouse is an open
system, if you're letting the airflow
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally go, if you're not retaining
heat, you don't have to add an air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner and a dehumidifier and all
this other stuff, which is like dumping
[SPEAKER_00]: NPK into your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're suggesting is kind of like
probiotic soil, but probiotic air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like letting life be life in the
greenhouse by thinking about what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant wants instead of trying to create a
very thin specified environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a much more natural way to farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more affordable and you can produce
some of the most top shelf products that
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody's ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people go, well, if you're
opening the sides or roof, you're letting
[SPEAKER_01]: in bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bugs don't want to go to this healthy
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bugs go to the plants that are yellowing
with this nutrient lockout from too much
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people think in the fall it's the
fade and it happens to be nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: lockout.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have nutrient lockout even
in light depth towards the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle because the plants are using an
extreme amount of water to support those
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, they've been
trapping air and the plants really will
[SPEAKER_01]: live.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do okay in abolic stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis plants especially are pretty
tough, but a lot of people go,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I pull my curtains or this happened
or the fog rolled in or this cold night or
[SPEAKER_01]: this super hot day, all hell broke loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because they were always making
those plants right at the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that one thing, that fluctuation in
farming happened, they couldn't deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: it and it was the nail in the coffin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just try to avoid riding that line so
that when farming fluctuations happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't become the nail in the coffin
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hey, Eric, thank you so much for
being on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we did a pretty solid job
bringing people up to speed on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about modern light depth and how to
get a little light depth in their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wouldn't mind, I do want to plug
something real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go right ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: April 7th here in Grass Valley,
California at our facility, we are having
[SPEAKER_01]: an advanced soil workshop with Elaine
Ingham here and another guy from a company
[SPEAKER_01]: called Crusev Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're doing is Elaine's actually
here to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though she's the leader in the soil
food web and living soil thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's into nowadays, this guy's one
of her advisors and he's been doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: now for two years in cannabis specific
only situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to come host it here because
just like you saw, Shango, a lot of what I
[SPEAKER_01]: am saying about the greenhouses is kind of
symbiotic to what goes on with the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and growing and some of this microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three of us are coming together here
to talk about greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to present all the data and
info and Elaine's here to quantify and
[SPEAKER_01]: learn herself on all this info that she
hasn't been exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's going to be a real great brain
trust too because I'm totally with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the future of cannabis is a
probiotic living soil techniques matched
[SPEAKER_00]: with light depth greenhouses and it just
kind of pulls everything together in a
[SPEAKER_00]: really healthy, sustainable way that makes
totally kill or flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That workshop, you've got all the experts
in one place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: April 7th, the tickets are online at
Eventbrite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a link in my bio on Instagram,
forever flowering greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: one word.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the link in my bio,
you can get tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tickets are a little bit, some people
might think they're a little pricey,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is two years of data that this
dude is revealing and he's not just giving
[SPEAKER_01]: it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a Frenchy cannoli
workshop in the sense that we're having
[SPEAKER_01]: some food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all going to be hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be crunching some killer
data with some killer people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's worth every penny.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you buy early, you get a deal on the
tickets and if you wait, the price goes up
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to have you here, Shango too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can help you out on getting a press
pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll have you back on the show here
in a couple of months to check in,
[SPEAKER_00]: hear how that went, and find out what the
latest is in modern light dep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Branstad is co-founder of Forever
Flowering Greenhouses.

[SPEAKER_00]: That's lightdep.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to check out the Forever
Flowering Greenhouses Instagram feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It itself is really great, but especially
when Eric goes live, and walks you around
[SPEAKER_00]: either his or somebody else's greenhouses,
and just gives you great words of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and best practices live.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are fantastic, and I've learned some
of my most important stuff from watching
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
