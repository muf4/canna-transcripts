[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really a big fan of holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since I was a kid, everyone around me
had these huge expectations on what they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted their holiday to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It created an ungodly amount of pressure
to perform for the delight of others and
[SPEAKER_00]: to soothe them when their childish desires
were not met.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is exhausting and I've only realized
how much it has impacted my life in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last couple of years during quarantine
because of all the time I've had for
[SPEAKER_00]: self-reflection and a bit of TikTok
therapy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I share this with you as a cautionary tale
about keeping your expectations low
[SPEAKER_00]: because on this episode on Shaping Fire,
I'm the special guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today on Shaping Fire, we are sharing my
recent appearance as guest on the Curious
[SPEAKER_00]: About Cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show's host, Jason Wilson,
is absolutely delightful and we share a
[SPEAKER_00]: similar vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interview covers my thoughts on using
outdoor regenerative cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rocky transition from medical to
recreational markets for cannabis patients
[SPEAKER_00]: at the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to form local growers' collectives and
how I formed the one here on Vashon
[SPEAKER_00]: Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rise of auto flowers, of course,
and some behind-the-scenes thoughts about
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire, the podcast, among other
topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole lot of good stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And jokes about the holidays and low
expectations aside, I'm sharing this
[SPEAKER_00]: interview because I'm actually proud of
what Jason and I produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly don't share all the podcasts
where I appear, but this one is especially
[SPEAKER_00]: well done and I think you might enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who prefer video,
you can watch the Curious About Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: video recording of this interview today on
the Shaping Fire YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do wanna note that I get the sniffles at
one point and for those of you not
[SPEAKER_00]: watching the video, I'm actually recording
my side of the video outside on my deck
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was pretty chilly that morning and
I got the sniffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you have a delightfully
tolerable holiday weekend by yourself or
[SPEAKER_00]: with loved ones and enjoy this episode 66
of Curious About Cannabis hosted by Jason
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilson with special guest, me,
Shango Lowes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody, this is Jason with Curious
About Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for tuning in once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am really, really excited because
we've got kind of a convergence of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis podcasts here, but I'm connecting
with somebody who I've been told
[SPEAKER_01]: repeatedly by guest after guest that I've
interviewed that this is a person I need
[SPEAKER_01]: to connect with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been told that a lot of the people
that I interview that I remind them of
[SPEAKER_01]: this person, so we finally made it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with Shango Lowes of the Shaping
Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shango, thanks so much for being willing
to take the time today to connect and come
[SPEAKER_01]: on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right off the top, I wanna say thank
you for the work that you do because as a
[SPEAKER_01]: scientist in this field and kind of
crawling out of my cave into media and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to connect with the outside world,
I definitely have recognized that your
[SPEAKER_01]: work has been some of the best that I've
come across in terms of trying to connect
[SPEAKER_01]: lay people with technical information in a
digestible way that's relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my hat's off to you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for the great work that
you've been doing so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really put my heart into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always doing my best and I really
enjoy it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that the show has grown,
we're in our fourth year now of Shaping
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten to the point where it can
support me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of years of doing multiple
jobs, but I'm at the point now that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: really focus on the show and I'm very
grateful for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopeful for me to hear because I'm
only you know, we're just past like a year
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half or so of curious about cannabis
running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm in that period right now of
working like multiple jobs, balancing this
[SPEAKER_01]: to and trying to to make it all happen so
I can totally, totally relate to that that
[SPEAKER_01]: hustle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that a lot of my listeners,
because they've told me a lot of my
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners do already listen to Shaping
Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to those that are unfamiliar or don't
know who you are, do you mind providing
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit of background?
[SPEAKER_01]: Into, you know, first, what Shaping Fire
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I want to work backwards and just
talk about kind of your relationship with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and and your general story.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then I guess I'll just start with
talking a little bit about Shaping Fire
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can lead me wherever you want
to lead me after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Shaping Fire is a audio only podcast
that focuses on cannabis health,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and solvent lists,
extraction, cultivation techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is in the early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the first year, I was focused to a
great deal on cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time, not only were there a lot
of other people covering cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: business, but I realized that after
medical cannabis went away in my state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington and my national clients in
medical started converting to rec that the
[SPEAKER_00]: vibe changed in the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't as excited about covering
business anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really much more interested in
cannabis patients, different cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: how working with them in different
preparation helps human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after or after I learned how to
make ice hash and then once ice hash rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: came on the scene, I realized that that
most of us can do all the things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need for cannabis at home without even
interacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interfacing with the licensed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while and while I wish the licensed
market success, I've got lots of friends
[SPEAKER_00]: in the licensed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that that wasn't the part that I
was most excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part I was excited about was small
cannabis communities, home grow and and
[SPEAKER_00]: people trading cannabis so that so they
had greater variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that's essentially what Shaping Fire
covers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got some of the best guests in the
whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pulling in, you know, botany
botanists, scientists from the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: folks who are neurologists, also cannabis
breeders, you know, a master master hash
[SPEAKER_00]: maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but folks are very talented and
experienced with making hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so I bring them on the show and
and we talk a lot of specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of the show was always to give
people enough information to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: take action.
[SPEAKER_00]: It frustrates me when I listen to a
podcast that is supposed to be teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: me, but it leaves all these big gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do my best to provide content
that gives people a nice full package so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can either make decisions or or
do the technique or or understand their
[SPEAKER_00]: health better in in in one nice,
tight 90 minute package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so so that's that's the nature of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I like to say that shaping
fire was shaping for you to get educated
[SPEAKER_00]: while we respect your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't spend a lot of time like,
you know, I don't get high on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't talk about my guests with
talk to my guests about what cultivars are
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's different shows that do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it draws a kind of audience that wants
that kind of, I don't know, bro vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hanging out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll do these long shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but the kinds of folks who tend to
listen to shaping fire tend to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis enthusiasts who also
have got other things they've got to get
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they run companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they are made their decision makers
or they're just like people who are busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I try not to waste folks time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get in, get the point,
get people the information that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need on whatever the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then in the show,
you know, in a cheerful way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and that's that's something I really
respect because that's been a big part of
[SPEAKER_01]: my approach, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that comes from just like my
analytical thinking as a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, yeah, I don't get high on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just it's really just what's the the core
piece of information that's interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: and and making that digestible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed that in your marketing,
you know, that we're trying not to waste
[SPEAKER_01]: your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also appreciate what you just said
about watching the this transition and the
[SPEAKER_01]: vibe change from as things switch from
medical to rec, because I definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced the same thing here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was involved in the medical
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a medical patient and also working,
you know, building this lab to try to help
[SPEAKER_01]: people understand what was in their
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were dealing mostly with patients,
a lot of medical patients that were make
[SPEAKER_01]: growing their own cannabis, making their
own products and wanting to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they were safe to consume and what
the potency was and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you do see this shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now all of it is just so, so
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard, I think, for some people to
appreciate just how substantially things
[SPEAKER_01]: have changed if they weren't involved in
the medical systems before, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything started to come online,
especially in other states that are taking
[SPEAKER_01]: a little longer to to make some of these
changes to their laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you speak to that a little bit,
just to expand a little bit more on your
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective on just exactly how things
change from kind of the early medical days
[SPEAKER_01]: into, you know, the legal systems that we
have now, what were some of those changes
[SPEAKER_01]: you started to pick up on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got three that I think are probably
good to hit on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is we've already hit on a
little bit, which is the players changed
[SPEAKER_00]: who was involved during the medical days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there were there were more
heritage cultivators and heritage medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: errors who were involved, who were not
they were fringe folks because there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to lose back in the medical days,
too, when there was still being raids and
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the laws were changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many people were working in the
gray market that, you know, most of us had
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the people in law enforcement who
were supporting our our ability to create
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and put it in the hands of
cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were other folks in law
enforcement who were not ascribing to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it made it very risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, once it became more
safe for capital and licensing started to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, the capital came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that comes a different kind of
risk assessment and different different
[SPEAKER_00]: bureaucracy for the players.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the heritage cultivators,
they didn't have the the credit score to
[SPEAKER_00]: rent a legal location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they didn't have the business acumen
because at their heart, they were farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: or alchemists, how they saw themselves,
not really as business people and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who were organized and did have
capital to be able to to rent legal places
[SPEAKER_00]: and go through the state bureaucracy and
end up getting the licenses and know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to hire out for HR and know how to sell to
investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a different kind of person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and again, I don't intend and it's not
my goal here to diss those folks because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that increased access in every state
is important and access is is a priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it very much changed from a we're
in it for the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been around cannabis all,
you know, for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to do our best by the
patients into being something that has
[SPEAKER_00]: more neon lights and finer packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the vibe changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and you know, and so so that was a
significant difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing I will point out is that
the the the varieties of products change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, certainly now that we're many more
years in to legalization in or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing in some states, there are
beginning to be more patient focused
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just about every state that has
medical first and then they go rec there
[SPEAKER_00]: is this sudden dearth of medical products
when the licenses come out, because
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed folks know that the things that
are always a reliable sell are high THC
[SPEAKER_00]: flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what everybody starts with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I had plenty of clients who
were making this transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, all right, start with the
high THC flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get that established, then we're
going to roll out the other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for patients who had gotten off
their their pharmaceuticals, that gap
[SPEAKER_00]: could literally kill them either because
they had to go back to pharmaceuticals and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were dealing with those side effects
or they had gotten to a point where the
[SPEAKER_00]: body had healed enough in certain ways
that they couldn't go back to those same
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals without it being a bumpy
ride of getting your body back attuned to
[SPEAKER_00]: a pharmaceutical solution instead of an
herbal solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so, you know, a perfect example for
that is full extract, cannabis oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: so an ethanol extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us know it is RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RSO usually disappears from the market
during the transition from medical to
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it does start to show up in
a rec market, you'll find companies who
[SPEAKER_00]: are like selling their CO2 RSO,
right, which is not, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's not the same thing,
right, because it's more economical for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to run it through a CO2 machine than
it is for them to do the more often
[SPEAKER_00]: laborious ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so the the there's this there's
this variety of products are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with the legal market,
some really cool things have come about,
[SPEAKER_00]: like really great dispensers for RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the inhalers are pretty
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the the advancement of
vaporizers has just wildly expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a lot of things that they
good that have come with the license
[SPEAKER_00]: market, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's more to do with the
idea that it's easier for these cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies to get funding now for their
novel products where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical is pre capital is capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was it was a lot harder for
those companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my third example also involves RSO,
the the full extract oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back in the day, if you had if
you needed RSO because you were sick,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could go to at least on the West
Coast, you could go to some kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, patient cannabis exchange of
some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they they were often,
you know, straddling the gray market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they were they're often,
you know, kind of straddling legality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the heart was there and the quality
was there often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people were smiling and there were
lots of hugs and it felt like a family
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and depending on where you were
regionally, you could get a one milliliter
[SPEAKER_00]: syringe of high quality RSO for between 15
and 60 bucks, 15 or 50 bucks, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: where you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and here and here is the example part
is that, you know, just about everybody I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew who made RSO had a discount for
people who were doing a 60 milliliters in
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 days cannabis protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you if you had cancer and you
had found yourself, you know, going to try
[SPEAKER_00]: RSO, you're either already kind of like an
herbally minded person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you were already broke because the
Western system had already taken all your
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctors are already taking them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you were you were at your last bet
and you were going to try cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually, you know, the people who had
cancer and were ready to try RSO were
[SPEAKER_00]: already broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all felt bad for them because they
had cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrible, terrible thing to have to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get people who, you know,
would give somebody a huge reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, say if they were selling their
syringes for, you know, fifty dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: normally, they would, you know,
if you're going to buy 60, we'll drop the
[SPEAKER_00]: price down to 25 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do it half price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, sure, some of that is like
you're buying in volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, you know, volume discounts are
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but really, it was more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of heart in that price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the licensed market is not able to do
that kind of price reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there is not bulk
purchasing really in the licensed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, if you if you need
multiple syringes of RSO, you buy one for
[SPEAKER_00]: seventy two dollars and another for
seventy two dollars and then another for
[SPEAKER_00]: seventy two dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people who need cannabis to live,
it has become harder for them to purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: at reasonable prices in the rec market,
which, of course, is keeping the the
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative unlicensed market very much
alive throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, the the rocky
transition from the medical markets in
[SPEAKER_00]: most states to the rec markets,
it had it's kind of done bad for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bad for the medical heritage
processors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also bad for the patients and also
because you know, this black market is
[SPEAKER_00]: still being kept alive because it's so
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also bad for rec.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mostly, you know, the state's
mismanagement of these transitions from
[SPEAKER_00]: medical to licensed recreational has just
given us a a a worse of all options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everything that that you just
brought up, it brings out a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: memories for me thinking about Oregon and
the transitions that we saw you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: going from medical to to recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that I think about from a
patient perspective, particularly when you
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about the reduction in the diversity
of products, I remember how much
[SPEAKER_01]: experimentation was going on with CBD THC
ratios leading up to like twenty sixteen
[SPEAKER_01]: or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously it's still happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the medical system, you know,
if I went to somebody and said I was
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for a certain ratio or once
dispensaries became legal, because for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while they were kind of in this weird gray
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they became officially legal,
you know, you could find four to ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: three to ones, two to ones, one to ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could find all of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there wouldn't be a lot of them,
but they they were solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I have these spinal cord
injuries and I found, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a two to one to four to one is very
nice for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that when things went
recreational, you really don't see a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you might see some one to ones,
but that's that's most of what you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's either high THC, high CBD is now
kind of getting relegated to hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you still see that in dispensaries
from time to time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for someone like myself,
that is a medical patient that no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: has a card because it's now legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that was a big change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I definitely have seen a lot of
those those same changes, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hearing you talk about it,
you know, it's obvious you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: passion for the patients and a lot of
passion for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like you were saying,
the the kind of source where all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: is really coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to kind of rewind quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind sharing how did your
relationship with cannabis get started?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something that goes back into,
you know, teenage or early 20s for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it something that you discovered
later?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that relationship come about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say I had I had two beginnings of
my relationship with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the first time was my freshman
year of college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went home.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went home for Christmas and he came
back and he brought some joints and I had
[SPEAKER_00]: never had access before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, had never seen it
around or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wasn't where I lived in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, suburbs, Catholic school,
that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and he brought it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for whatever reason,
I was immediately interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like there was no second thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, you want to try this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, let's try new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we tried it and I immediately
thought it was great from a an
[SPEAKER_00]: experiential, you know, both
recreationally because it was fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also I, you know, I immediately got
the idea of the mind expansion part.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, it really shifts my perspective
in ways I can consider my mundane life in
[SPEAKER_00]: new, fresh ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it took me, you know,
about four weeks to get my first bag after
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't think I've been without
it ever since, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1990 now or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the funny things is I learned how
to, you know, smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first season of the Simpsons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to we used to all get together on
I don't know if it was Tuesday or Thursday
[SPEAKER_00]: nights, but we'd all get together and sit
on the floor of the dorm room and all
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke and watch that first season of
Simpsons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's how I was smoking with
friends all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know, I think I need to
get some of this for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so then we've got like just like a
lifetime of being somebody who enjoys
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then 2011 came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a car accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suffered dual concussion resulting in a
traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the neurologist actually told me off
the record, he says, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that you consider using
mushrooms to help rebuild your neural net
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of soothe the the overactivity
that I was getting, the overstimulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says and he said, you know,
I also recommend that you move out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I moved out to Vashon Island where
I live now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and he also said, I understand
that there's some healing properties in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I can't recommend any of this for
you officially.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, but but if you're, you know,
like look into this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was astonished, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, back in back in those
days, you know, 2011, you still like
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't tell your doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was I was I was a daily cannabis
user at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so I'm like, huh, medicine,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started looking into it and
started reading the early research,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly coming out of Europe and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, wow, there really are medicinal
properties going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then and then my dad got really
bad knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so so I had already learned how to
make a cannabis tincture for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help keep my my nervous system calm and
then I wouldn't get overstimulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then my dad, he's got really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and the the pharmaceuticals he was
using for anti inflammation really had
[SPEAKER_00]: some bad side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, hey, I bet you I could put
my tincture in some like like body lotion
[SPEAKER_00]: or hand cream or something and whip them
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boom, topical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tried it and it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my dad put it on his knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's all like, oh, my gosh,
this works so much better and for so much
[SPEAKER_00]: longer than this like ugly pharmaceutical
that he was one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean to dis all
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are there are appropriate
pharmaceuticals at appropriate times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, an herbal remedy was
much better for my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was very enthusiastic about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that made me feel good about it as
well, because, you know, my parents were
[SPEAKER_00]: historically discouraging me from cannabis
or, you know, drugs in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but but at this point, I'm like,
wait a minute, something here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is helping me soothe my brain injury
and heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's helping my dad to what else
is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I dove into both like learning
about cannabis medicine from any sources I
[SPEAKER_00]: could and also trying to learn herbal
preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live here in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live pretty close to Bastyr University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my whole area is just like dripping
with herbalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if you're you know,
if you're nice to them, they will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: their secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so that's that that's when I
got my rebirth in the in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine in in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then, of course, you know,
things that things have continued since
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did that I mean, first of all,
I want to say I get why people wanted us
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk, because in some ways we have some
big parallels between the two of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I went through a similar
experience with my mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after I had all these spinal cord
injuries and trying to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: get control over, you know, myself and the
things that I was dealing with,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been a regular cannabis user,
just like you had described.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, kind of discover this
new perspective of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my mom had really bad
fibromyalgia and, you know, arthritis and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very similarly, I gave her some
extract that we mixed with a like a
[SPEAKER_01]: coconut oil based topical issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just mixed it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And likewise, she's like, oh, my gosh,
this is better than any pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever taken for, you know,
for these these problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny those parallels I can
totally relate to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did so you, you know, you start to
understand how cannabis is affecting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And helping you find this kind of new
balance that you need in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's bleeding out into loved
ones and seeing the effects that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: can have on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did your passion for education start
to really manifest, where you really
[SPEAKER_01]: started to move forward in sharing all of
these things that you were learning with
[SPEAKER_01]: other people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've been doing I mean,
beyond the podcast, you've organized all
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of events on Vashon Island and other
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely want to talk about the
work that you've done to really bring the
[SPEAKER_01]: community together to learn and share
knowledge and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what were the yeah, how did those
seeds, I guess, get germinated,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will, to bloom into education?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see where you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so the way the timeline went out is hit
my head in 2011, started making my own
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when you're making
tincture, and and it's working for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: and people, your friends and loved ones
find out you're making it suddenly,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using your tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then their loved ones are
using your tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then medical got going more
significantly in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least my participation of it was was
increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my tinctures became being sold through
the the Washington medical market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to make these tinctures and
share them through, you know, legal
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was at that point that people
started asking me questions, because at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point, they're all like, OK,
which of the four tinctures do I want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I want them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, which which which cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: What press preparation is going to help me
now versus something in high CBD that is
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to strengthen your
endocannabinoid system and will help me
[SPEAKER_00]: long term?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like like and that was when I
first got into thinking about and teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing strategies to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I loved that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, the the medical days
were a heyday, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not not only because everybody was so not
not everybody, but the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: people were very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the margins weren't as tight as
they are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could actually do this and
support yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and while I never got to that level,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We you know, the market transitioned to
legal before, you know, I had like a
[SPEAKER_00]: business business, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: My volume was never of units where that
was never significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that buoyed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then when there was the when when the
market started to well, before we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about the market pivoting, it was at the
same time that I began reaching out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: the underground cannabis growers on Vashon
because Vashon has been known for its high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality cannabis all the way back to the
70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, bands would come through Seattle
and they try to like get their Vashon hook
[SPEAKER_00]: up and pick up some weed for the rest of
tour and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I knew that these these cultivators
were here on Vashon, but I also knew they
[SPEAKER_00]: were very much still in the underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but but because there were so many
people producing on the island,
[SPEAKER_00]: prices for ounces on the island were just
like ridiculously low, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was great if you lived on the
island.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really bad for the the
cultivators who were trying to support
[SPEAKER_00]: their families on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I realized that there were all
these dispensaries a short ferry ride away
[SPEAKER_00]: in in Seattle that would love to have the
produce from my island.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of the none of the cultivators
wanted to leave the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, once you once you moved here,
you're like you're like, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to Babylon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's noisy and everybody's driving crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's good here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just stay in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but because I was you know,
I was more recently on the island than
[SPEAKER_00]: these cultivators who grew up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a one page invitation talking a
little bit about this group that I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to form on Vashon called Vimea,
which stands for the Vashon the Vashon
[SPEAKER_00]: Island Marijuana Entrepreneurs Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to know what they wanted as
far as representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what what can you use as a
cultivator?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would help you in the underground?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I made up a bunch of these letters
and I started giving them out to the kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of people on the island who I thought
would know cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particular types of farmers,
certain types of community organizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm like, you don't have to tell
me if you know a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you know a cultivator, would you
give them this letter?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these these these letters went into
the underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made like twenty five of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these these these black market
cultivators started like showing up at the
[SPEAKER_00]: oddest of times, too, because nobody was
calling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just be, you know, you know,
at at a baseball game or a softball game,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and somebody would come up to me
and say, like, you know, you're shango,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, hey, I got your letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, you want to go for a
little walk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'd go and we'd talk and and,
you know, the the universally everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was afraid to get busted for
their grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I knew that normalization on the
island was one of the important things
[SPEAKER_00]: that Vimy was going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then the other thing was is
that everybody was spending way too much
[SPEAKER_00]: money on inputs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these fancy ass inputs are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so the very first thing I did when
I formed Vimeo was to start essentially a
[SPEAKER_00]: media slash, I guess, propaganda campaign
that was pro cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, things things like,
you know, we were you back in those days,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were using words like pot and sure
marijuana a lot more than we were now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we would do things, you know,
we would put out things like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hug your local pot grower, you know,
you know, pot growers are local farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, pot cultivation is a family
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which which got the rest of the island to
realize that you don't have to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as a scourge.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are members of the community and and
we should embrace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second thing I did is I
started pulling together more of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators and I said, you know,
this is still in the old days when people
[SPEAKER_00]: were throwing away their soil after every
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of keeping it and aging the soil
and, you know, more of a no till kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: region thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in these days, people were just
dumping their soil and thought they had to
[SPEAKER_00]: start with new soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, you know, we started bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we started bulk purchasing soil and
just having, you know, a higher quality
[SPEAKER_00]: soil than was available generally on the
island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just having it come and be
dumped at one location and everybody would
[SPEAKER_00]: come with their truck and fill up their
truck and then head on home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we got these hugely better
prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, after that, people were all like,
all right, Chango, what else what else you
[SPEAKER_00]: got for us, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started doing, you know,
some other, you know, soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started buying bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this was this was well
ahead of my awareness of the more serious
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative scene, which I'm,
you know, a big part of now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in these early days, I knew I liked
organic farming because I grew a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of organic food.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I certainly didn't have like the the
regenerative whole mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just very stoked that we were using
natural amendments and I knew how to make
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just the idea was like,
you know, let's let's try to get people
[SPEAKER_00]: off the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a thing that early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started doing that and people
really liked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at this point, the underground
growers started to trust me more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm learning a whole lot about what it
means to be a cultivator, because I had I
[SPEAKER_00]: was not a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was an enthusiast and then and then a
patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started going to these some of these
folks that that we had a more trusting
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, hey, you know, can I can I
shop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your flower into Seattle?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and they're all like, you want me to
like front it to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, I guess in a way,
but I just want to borrow it for two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I can I can I have, you know,
a couple pounds and I'll go over to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries and try to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And either I will bring you back money or
I will bring you back the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to it will not be in my
hands tonight one way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, all right, let's give
this a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took it over there and I came back
with money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I and I got them about 150
percent of the price that they would
[SPEAKER_00]: normally get on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made me very popular.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so they're like,
wait, you're saving us money on the inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're bringing us home more money and
setting up these relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually, once they they got
set up, you know, the cannabis was finding
[SPEAKER_00]: its way off the island, which honestly was
making the turned parents people a little
[SPEAKER_00]: happier, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was a public figure since I
wasn't a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be out front more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was out front saying nice things
about cannabis farmers, explaining their
[SPEAKER_00]: needs and explaining that this
organization I had started was helping
[SPEAKER_00]: filter a lot of this cannabis off the
island, which they so caused them to
[SPEAKER_00]: embrace my new organization a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the farmers were also thrilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they were able to get more for
their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so this all happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then everything falls apart at the end
of medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we you know, we got together as Vimeo
as a group a few times to go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations when it came out, like the the
how to apply for a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and I read it all and I marked it
all up and then got together all these
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are interested in getting
licenses and essentially taught the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more we met three times like this
and the more we got into it, we more we
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that this sucked.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that this was this this was going to
be really expensive and didn't really have
[SPEAKER_00]: the needs of the cultivator at heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a couple of people tried
and almost no one succeeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they they were they were
wanting to give their money to a different
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of license holder than people who
were participating in the medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had to make a decision at that
point because, you know, I wasn't going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be involved with the medical market
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't look like I was going to move
into the licensed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came back to my first love,
which was teaching patients, teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing strategies and creating a safe
place for cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the the initial meetings that we
had to learn about regulations became
[SPEAKER_00]: patient outreach meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they became like, you know,
you know, you know, one doctor would come
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, we're very lucky to have
Dr. Ethan Russo, a neurologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: lives on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my neighbor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so Dr. Russo, like,
you know, came and talked at one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: events and explained the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's all like, you know,
this was very new information for for the
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, if if you are a an event
promoter and you're trying to book
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers, if a cannabis doctor,
scientist, celebrity, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you know that you've already hosted Dr.
Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're figuring that you're pretty
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got all these yeses from
international like cannabis talent who
[SPEAKER_00]: would come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell them that we're a patient
outreach organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't charge any money to attend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're donation based only.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not pay our speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we'll we had a sponsorship
deal with the one hotel on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you know, if you come to the
island overnight, we'll put you up for the
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, you're just coming because you
care about patients and you want to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to the real deal people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people flocked to Vashon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so suddenly now we've got this scene
which grew from Vashon to Seattle to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've had people fly from
Colorado and from the Bay Area for
[SPEAKER_00]: different different events we've had
because the the variety of teaching at
[SPEAKER_00]: these events was very down home,
good vibe stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where that's where the
education circle all around your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the education came in is it
was it was originally let's organize
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators because I'm interested in them
and I wanted to be helpful on this new
[SPEAKER_00]: island that I called home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then I saw things that I
could do to be of service to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did those things, which helped my
reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As being somebody who was trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then we pivoted that into a
patient organization to the point that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I speak here at the senior
center a couple of times a year and I'm on
[SPEAKER_00]: the local radio station as a guest
regularly and been on the front page of
[SPEAKER_00]: the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like there's I've got I've
developed this niche for myself where like
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been referred to as like the weed
guy or the pot guy a gazillion times,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not because I was selling bags.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't sell flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I'm it's because I'm teaching
everybody and then telling people where
[SPEAKER_00]: they can get the stuff that they need to
feel better, whether it's in the wreck or
[SPEAKER_00]: unlicensed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, so so that brings us,
you know, pretty much to where we are now
[SPEAKER_00]: with Vimeo, where, you know,
unfortunately, we've been on sabbatical
[SPEAKER_00]: because of covid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Vimeo will be the last group to get
people coming back together because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like we are at the most high risk
and also, you know, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the cannabis scene who who are
resisting vaccination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can't I'm certainly not going to
be that guy who checks everybody's ID at
[SPEAKER_00]: the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's not really how I roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to have to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to wait until the risk
is decreased enough that we can bring
[SPEAKER_00]: together a room of 100 patients and not
have it be super dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we won't have meetings
until, you know, at least spring of 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a bummer.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to leave us with a good two
years without meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, got to keep the patients
safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's it's the weird situation
we're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I felt the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do in-person workshops pretty
regularly on cannabis science topics,
[SPEAKER_01]: was doing guest lectures at universities
and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been I mean, pretty much once
everything kicked off around, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: February, March of 2020, you know,
it's like I have a daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also regularly see, you know,
my parents who have all sorts of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, you know, myself and my wife
have medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's we've been basically, you know,
just being very strict on in-person events
[SPEAKER_01]: and having to get people together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's been interesting because
I've had to rely on virtual communication,
[SPEAKER_01]: leaning more on podcasting, leaning more
on on that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does feel weird because you like to
be with people and there's there are these
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions and moments and knowledge
sharing that happens in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so hard to to get those dynamics
captured in a virtual setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've experienced this where you
see the knowledge sharing, the questions
[SPEAKER_01]: being asked, the looks on people's faces,
these different subtleties that come out
[SPEAKER_01]: in in-person events.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really, really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least, you know, those are the kinds of
things that lead me to want to do those
[SPEAKER_01]: things more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing all that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I yeah, I can imagine it's been a hugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, hugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I live on an island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a single guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a house by myself on the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am not getting enough hugs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at first when Covid came and all
the conventions were canceled,
[SPEAKER_00]: I must admit it was nice to get like six
months to a year of a travel break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had been traveling two,
three weekends a month to to speak at
[SPEAKER_00]: events and to teach and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that had gotten to be a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I was getting tired of being,
you know, being a road warrior all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really, really like my my my
national and now international group of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis family, like people I would see
at events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was cool to have a break for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the break has gone longer than I
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am you know, I because I'm a I'm a I
risk patient because I've got severe
[SPEAKER_00]: asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not rushing to go like,
you know, MJ Biz is coming up soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, like I was certainly
not going to that this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I am an at risk patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I really wish I I was going to an
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish Cultivation Classic in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Hall of Flowers to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I skipped that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so but I miss those hugs, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really miss seeing the cannabis people
and being, you know, smiling with them and
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, going outside and token and
then walking around and talking with
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors like I really, really miss the
extended community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love my Vashon community,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been very focused on,
you know, working on stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but, you know, it would be nice to to
go some cool places and do some cool
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's I'm ready whenever the time is
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a good time to kind of switch
a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've been talking about how all
of this is developed and the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to spend some time just
talking about, you know, the the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Curious About Cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about what makes you
curious about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I'll just lay out one
basic question related to the podcast and
[SPEAKER_01]: then spend on other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are some insights that stand out
to you that you've gained from all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that you've talked to, you know,
over the past four years or so on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some notable things that stood
out to you that maybe changed your
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective a little bit or that you just
were totally unaware of that that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: blew your mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are some kind of the more
significant insights that you've gained
[SPEAKER_01]: from doing Shaping Fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would say one thing for sure would
be understanding how different each
[SPEAKER_00]: human's body is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea of individualized medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really kind of thought that
cannabis was the same for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like wildly untrue how how
people react to different terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles, how people, you know,
cannabis is is biphasic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning you can take a little bit of THC,
which will reduce your anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take beyond your personal
threshold, it will cause anxiety.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of cannabis's biphasic nature,
we're all we all have different
[SPEAKER_00]: thresholds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, somebody big get the
relief they need with the tiniest little
[SPEAKER_00]: puffy puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas somebody else is going to be like
pulling tubes and blowing clouds to get
[SPEAKER_00]: where they need based on what,
you know, how many receptors they have and
[SPEAKER_00]: how busy those receptors are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the understanding that each patient
needs to be addressed uniquely and without
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying over too many assumptions,
that was good for me to learn as a as a
[SPEAKER_00]: health educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was also good for me for just
generally realizing that I should not
[SPEAKER_00]: generalize people entirely to respect each
person's individual nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of got to that through trying
to help people relieve their, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: their but their body issues and just
realizing that, oh, you know, everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: different and on a lot of issues,
not just their medicine and not to assume
[SPEAKER_00]: I know folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was that was a breakthrough thing
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one was I had no idea I was so
interested in soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When when when I first started
cultivating, it was just like take the bag
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, put it in, you know, throw in some
kind of nutrients from the store and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I started, you know, talking to
what would become known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative scene people and realizing
the magic of all the biological life in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere and the protozoa and the
microbes and how these folks get along and
[SPEAKER_00]: how for me, one of the first things I
realized was that, you know, we get cold
[SPEAKER_00]: early in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we've already had it's it's it's
like the second week of October coming
[SPEAKER_00]: into the second week of October now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already had 50 degree nights for four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I did until I started learning
about soil that I realized that the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and the containers were going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes and everything were sifting
up and then the plants would just go to
[SPEAKER_00]: mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't that, oh, my my plants were
unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that the soil went to sleep,
which signaled to the plant that that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're done for the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you should mold for the cycle of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so next thing you know, I'm reading
everything I can on soil science and
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative, you know, growing techniques
and and and creating your own inputs on
[SPEAKER_00]: your own property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when it comes to shaping
fire, the guests that I have very much are
[SPEAKER_00]: based on what I'm interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and luckily, the show the
show's at a point now where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody everybody takes my call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can I can I can reach out to whoever and
say, hey, would you come on the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about this thing that I would like to
learn about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, everybody's like,
yeah, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I think that I think that because
I don't fake that I know all this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: before the show, I think the audience digs
that because people it's very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common for people to say,
I like that we're learning so much
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, you know,
some some podcasts, they pretend that they
[SPEAKER_00]: know everything and they'll they'll even
talk over the guest and try to tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: guest story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'm much more of a like,
get my I keep quiet and try to let the
[SPEAKER_00]: guest to tell their truth and then ask
good questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I learn something like,
you know, it's common for me to go like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I never got that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can almost feel my audience
going, oh, me, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm not I'm not going to
front for a second that I know all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, after doing, you know,
four years of my own show and then another
[SPEAKER_00]: one hundred and five episodes before that
for Gangepreneur.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've done over, you know,
200 episodes and I've been doing this for
[SPEAKER_00]: like five years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I learn new stuff on every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's why I do those topics so I
can learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and having that lifelong learner
mentality, I think is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's something I'm always trying
to promote that regardless of whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: niche you've specialized in that you know
a lot about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always so much more to learn and
to maintain that curiosity is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humble, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humble, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you start, you think you
know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not not only will you stop
learning, but you'll probably also start
[SPEAKER_00]: being a prick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the biggest assholes you'll meet
in the industry are those that have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of knowledge that think they
know a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's called with the like
Dunning-Kruger effect or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a a model for that that
you can look up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone listening that wants to look it up,
you can actually see this theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Related to knowledge acquisition and
confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when you get a little bit
of knowledge, you often overestimate how
[SPEAKER_01]: much you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a lot of knowledge,
you generally under represent how much you
[SPEAKER_01]: know because you've become humbled and
recognize that, you know, even the things
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know a lot about, you know,
who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always more rabbit holes and new
new things to shine light on and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I wanted to make sure that
we spent time on, because I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really into regenerative
agriculture now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something we talked about before we
started recording that I found really
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinating was that you've been trying to
figure out how it might be possible to
[SPEAKER_01]: take, you know, permaculture regenerative
agriculture principles and take them from
[SPEAKER_01]: the outdoor cultivation environment and
find ways to integrate them in the indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we wrap up, I definitely wanted
to make sure to spend some time speaking
[SPEAKER_01]: on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know we've talked about a little bit
already off camera, but can you share a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about your recent indoor
cultivation foray and what you learned
[SPEAKER_01]: from that experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I've got to admit, I have evolved
my thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, another thing that makes one
humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for years, I have been a proponent of
only outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the quality of the medicine
that comes out of outdoor plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: grown under the sun is higher than indoor
because the wider spectrum of light means
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are creating a wider terpene
profile, a stronger cannabinoid profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just generally the plants thrive
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the appreciation of indoor
from its connoisseur level, rag appeal and
[SPEAKER_00]: beauty, but that's a different topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the medicinal value of
outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also didn't have a place to grow
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was an outdoor guy because that's
all I had access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe the gospel of Northern
California outdoor that that's the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I've practiced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the years, I have increased my
soil knowledge and using natural inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: and natural farming techniques and KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got a pretty good sense of
what I'm doing outdoors now and keeping my
[SPEAKER_00]: soil alive over the year and using that
same thriving soil the following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it became important to me to do
two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, I needed new things to explore
on the Instagram, the shaping fire
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got like 11,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to always provide helpful
tidbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a lot harder to do if you're
an outdoor grower during the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know, let's see if I can
do this stuff indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this new house that I moved into
last year, I've got a little bit of room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just set up a simple four by four
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a big fan of letting the plant
roots talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of making individualized
containers, I set up a really nice four
[SPEAKER_00]: foot by four foot by 20 inch deep bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I used the the layered biomimicry
soil technique that was taught by that
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped by Leighton Morrison on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I asked him to get involved to make
sure I did the bed right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wildcrafted all my inputs,
which was a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, I highly recommend it for
quality of flour, but I don't recommend it
[SPEAKER_00]: for the amount of hassle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I never realized that wild crafting
silt was going to be so damn hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so anyway, so I wildcrafted
everything for the bed and built it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then because in my head,
like I understand that there are indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's lots of options, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, there's there's hydro,
there's Rockwell cubes, there's all this
[SPEAKER_00]: other kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but none of those are really how I do
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am I like the, you know, Jeff Lowenfeld
says, you know, if a worm can't live in
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it's not really a growing medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I know that I know that it's
it's up for argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, and I'm not trying to
pick a fight with the with the Rockwell
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but for me, that's where my head is,
is I want to use real soil biology because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a soil nerd.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so I wanted to I started bringing
in as many of the techniques that I could
[SPEAKER_00]: find from outdoors, indoors and did,
you know, did my first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found I found lights that I really
liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like their spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the company's philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's bios lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make they make really good lights for
both humans and for and for cultivating
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually a NASA spinoff company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, their scientists helped develop the
the LED growing setups for the space
[SPEAKER_00]: station, which is as an as an odd thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually used to work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I was going to say, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a funny thing to mention
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to live in Colorado for a while in
late 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked for a technology company that
was making RFID devices for a space hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the original name for the space
station?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, stuff that I have
touched is, you know, theoretically still
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the space station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got off the got off the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the the the first run out of the tent
was like the best things I have ever grown
[SPEAKER_00]: in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recognize how difficult that is to as a
as a devout outdoor guy that I grew the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff indoor that is without a doubt the
best weed that I had ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it was like the top five
things I had ever even smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I realized was how limited I am
by how short and crappy our summers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live here in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you think about it,
a simple eight week flowering period,
[SPEAKER_00]: if if if the plants start to flower here
around August 15th, that's October 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are soaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cold by October 15th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, we only really get about five
weeks of growing season before things
[SPEAKER_00]: start going to hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I realized that I'm actually a lot
better grower than I thought I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that I was trying to grow well in a
poor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as I took those same
regenerative techniques and brought them
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, I hit it out of the ballpark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that made me feel really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Year after year of getting beaten down by
the bad weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a schmuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm like, ah, you know,
someday I'll be decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll just I'll just keep on
learning and keep on plugging away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I grow once indoors and it's
like, holy smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that that made me feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm still torn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it really it was really satisfying
to me to grow flowers that I could never
[SPEAKER_00]: finish here indoors and have them finish
beautifully, like really finish,
[SPEAKER_00]: not like oh, it needed 10 more days
outdoor.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can take it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've been.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that stuff still, you know,
that stuff's still great to process into
[SPEAKER_00]: tinctures and RSO and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not like fun to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it's it's just not
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the indoor stuff is definitely there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I'm at this new point now where I am
absolutely a lover of outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of where I live, I absolutely
see the need for indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I'm going to do indoor,
I'm not going to be using bottles and rock
[SPEAKER_00]: wall and A&B formulas and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to be using like like whole
nature soil additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild crafted when I could do it
responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, you know, you know,
build a soil, you know, gives out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sells a lot of really great
inputs, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, get stuff from like there
and and then leaving the only real problem
[SPEAKER_00]: for me, the fact that I'm using
electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lights, which, you know, I try to,
you know, have a small carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm somewhere in between a I use so
little electricity in the rest of my life
[SPEAKER_00]: and my carbon footprint is so small that
if if I'm going to choose to spend my
[SPEAKER_00]: allotment of electricity on the lights,
that's my decision to make.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even more importantly, I am
aggressively researching and continuing to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to solar people because I think that
when the day comes that we can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, capture the sun and put it in
batteries and have that push enough juice
[SPEAKER_00]: to run LED lights, it will absolutely
remake the home grower industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that that time is soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so, you know, am I totally
comfortable with, you know, using lights
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I picked good LED lights that don't
use a lot of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am producing my own medicine,
which I think is legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as there is a real opportunity
to, you know, teach using solar at home,
[SPEAKER_00]: for home grow, I will have that show
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I will be all into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so yeah, I've been this transition
place where I am a devout outdoor grower
[SPEAKER_00]: who now has fallen in love with indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm wildly excited about my
second cycle coming up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did you what did you grow for
your for this first round of indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: experimentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so before I go into it, people will be
like probably shocked that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: name five plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was part of my learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five plants is way too many for a four by
four tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will we will definitely cause,
you know, tie that up to a learner's
[SPEAKER_00]: error.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to finish five different things
so I could try five different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was it like over grew like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, the the I grew the the the hot,
hot bigot OG that has been it was bred by
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick Rysdon at Lime Rising Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cross of GMO and cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an absolutely delightful strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was given seeds that were bred
by my good friend and very popular
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis guy, Michael Hinden, who who died
a year ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, I was on my way to
pick up these seeds when I found out that
[SPEAKER_00]: he had been murdered the prior day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like at the airport going down
to meet with Leighton Morrison in in in
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were going to drive over to
Hindi's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I found out that that he asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so there's a lot of grieving
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, his business partner,
you know, Widow Brianna reached out to me
[SPEAKER_00]: and she said, hey, you know, I knew he was
going to do this thing with you and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give you seeds for the patients
on Vashon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still want to continue on with the
things that that Michael wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she sent me almost a complete set
of of the modern epigenetics first
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all runs crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that became extra special,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not only are the these crosses
that I was hot to grow, but it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Michael's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it became a real, you know,
labor of love, for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew Michael's secret stuff,
which is GMO runs and then also a jet fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: OG runs called Private Jet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a stinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really great plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael's secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Michael's secret stuff is a good plan
because I like GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the jet fuel OG runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like nasty and caustic and
stony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then the two opposite corners
grew a land race, Acapulco Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which which was OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't turn out as nicely as I had
hoped it would.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't have a lot of nose to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then I ran CSI Humboldt's UK
Cheese Skittles cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not UK Cheese Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obama.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've always liked the Obama
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the funny thing is, is that big,
you know, is just a monster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the big and OG in a four by four
and it turns into a cage fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big it like overgrew everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so that was really
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I'm very much excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to I'm going to Scrog this
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I'm just going to stick to
three plants, which is probably still more
[SPEAKER_00]: than I should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my goal is to grow them and then just
weave them back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the cool things that
since since I'm not cultivating for
[SPEAKER_00]: profit, I'm cultivating for medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that I have like things to take
photographs of to put on the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can embrace my screw ups.
Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't like, oh, if I did this wrong,
I can't pay rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not using that to pay rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay rent from the advertising on the
show, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can really embrace my mistakes
and go, oh, well, I f'ed that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's all learn from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this stupid thing I did,
you know, because I was I was naive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't have the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use those, you know, those things to
teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very, very much love indoor now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and now and now I'm like, you know,
plotting what plants I'm going to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle after the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've got I've got indoor
fantasies now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been hooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have absolutely been hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And constantly now, like even though I
don't have any more room in my house other
[SPEAKER_00]: than this four by four tent, I'm already
thinking, how can I how can I do a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, two or three plants is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd really love to do like a full
patient card of 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's that's not where I'm at
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have you absolutely have you played
around with auto flowers at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I fell in love with auto flowers and
became a big proponent of them about three
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I learned what an auto flower
was by you know, by by by going into the
[SPEAKER_00]: fields in Oregon, actually in Oregon near
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric Crawford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their first auto was a was a all
CBD hemp cultivar called RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was there and they explained to
me how they're how they're not dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: on the sun, they're dependent on,
you know, their length of light and that
[SPEAKER_00]: they automatically mature and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all like, holy hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patience everywhere that is not California
needs these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so many of the genetics are
designed for California weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then we don't have California
weather in most of the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea that, you know,
we can start something June 1st and
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest it middle of September when we're
all still in drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I immediately dug into that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started hunting out auto flower breeders
and putting them on my show and hunting
[SPEAKER_00]: out seeds so that I could grow and take
pictures and learn myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hooked up with Jeff Loewenfels,
who put out a book on auto flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: told him that when the book came out,
I wanted to have him on on my show for his
[SPEAKER_00]: first interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually invited me to write something
for the jacket on the jacket of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and as we talked earlier, you know,
I did a lot of traveling to teach about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was usually being booked to talk
about something patient oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my I guess this would have been two
or two, three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID days, everything matches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but but, you know, about a year and a
half before we started all the COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, I was just touring, going to
conventions and teaching auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, you know, historically have a
pretty bad reputation because the past
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds have been sure low yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty, pretty weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the new generation of seeds are
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they're not going to get to
be monster plants that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all still love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like most people don't have the
weather to grow those monster plants or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least to finish them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to grow a monster plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are the plant are the flowers ever
going to finish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not most places in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I kind of took the auto flower
gospel on the road and and I reached out
[SPEAKER_00]: to lots of auto flower seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, hey, do you want to sponsor my
talk?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all it takes for you to sponsor the
talk is to send me a box of seeds that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can give away to patients after the talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they're like, hell yeah,
Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these all these folks sent me
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I asked everybody,
hey, you throw in a couple extra for me so
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow them and and put pictures on on
Instagram and I'll send you traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, yeah, we're good with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I would go to all these all these
cities and give my talk about auto flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and then say, you know, if you are a
patient, come up and get a seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have if you are not a patient,
don't come get a seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go go buy one from one of these seed
providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out on the floor and buy them at the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you know, if you're if you consider
yourself a legit patient, come get packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients are usually neglected,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, especially at trade shows
because they've got no money to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so suddenly they're they're they're
the ones getting the free stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like high quality, good seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it felt good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to be the conduit for that kind
of love from the from the breeders to the
[SPEAKER_00]: to the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so I'm very grateful that the auto
flower community has embraced me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though I'm not a breeder,
all I want to do is is help spread their
[SPEAKER_00]: gospel and why you should buy their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and and I think they get
that my heart's in the right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not I'm not trying to take
anything from the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I just want to make what I want to make
their art history more popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, you know, even though auto flowers
still tend to get a lot of flack by a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain kind of grower, I'm really honored
to be, you know, one of the people at the
[SPEAKER_00]: at the forefront of teaching auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's super fascinating to me for
some of the very reasons that have come
[SPEAKER_01]: about in just talking about your
experimentation with indoor and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just thinking about how you translate
cannabis cultivation to other places other
[SPEAKER_01]: than California and the lower half of
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have to expand our
conceptions of, you know, of all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things and recognize, like you said,
that everywhere is not California having
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of arid environment and these
long summers and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned before the interview
started that I'm from the southeast and so
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping my eyes on, you know,
Tennessee, North Carolina, Arkansas,
[SPEAKER_01]: these places that are the hemp starting to
get big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're jumping into large fields of
cannabis cultivation and are recognizing
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, no, like this doesn't this
doesn't quite translate everything I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been reading in all these books and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't quite match up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so seeing experimentation with auto
flowers, I find particularly fascinating
[SPEAKER_01]: from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can auto flowering varieties be used
in places that typically do get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more humid that the rainy season start
really early or in places where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you get these cold fronts that
come really early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing how that can be a bridge to
especially because as places legalize
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, they usually don't let you bring
cannabis from other places, other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're stuck with, you know,
in whatever state you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it goes medical or, you know,
full adult use legal, you've got to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with the climate and situation you have,
which is one reason why people often
[SPEAKER_01]: retreat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say retreat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the best way to put that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they they tend to default back to
indoor because they just figure outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't even an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be interesting to see if auto
flowers as they get bred and improved
[SPEAKER_01]: upon, because they've definitely changed a
lot since like the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember back in the day, like the old
like High Times magazines and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you'd start to see
advertisements for auto flowers for closet
[SPEAKER_01]: grows, you know, so that the plants would
be small enough that you could keep in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little grow box or, you know, people used
to grow in like PC cases, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they would outfit.
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow plants in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so seeing auto flowers come from that,
you know, kind of early start to where it
[SPEAKER_01]: is now is just really fascinating to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got me really, especially from a
scientific perspective, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do trials with auto flowers and
start to look at the biochemistry of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things and and see if we notice any
interesting things in some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics that we don't see in other things
because you never know until you look.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's all fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something I definitely want to check
on because it seems like for a place like
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, that would definitely be the
way to go as far as outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the some of the early auto flowers
that I was growing were like 100 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but but this summer I got to grow a bunch
of 60 days.
Wow.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic auto flowers that were 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they're not big plants,
but, you know, just when we were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier about individualized medicine for
patients, you need individualized genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: for growers.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of patients, you know,
OK, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful that they could potentially
grow a 12 foot plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how the hell are they going to take
that down?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people with mobility issues or
who are growing in a backyard and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to get their stuff ripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are there are particular growers
that growing a two and a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: three foot, maybe a four foot plant,
that's going to stay short.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe they grow a few more of them so
they have some variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who who don't need the
traditional monster plant because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the same way that we talk about
individualized medicine, I like to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about individualized cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't that one one seeds are
necessarily better than their other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the seeds highest use for that
particular cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think it's another other
way that we as educators can encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: people to, you know, be be in service to,
you know, the people that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: educate, whether or not they be,
you know, people who identify as patient
[SPEAKER_00]: growers or just home growers or or,
you know, extractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's all about, you know,
being in service and so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual cannabis enthusiast can choose
which attributes of our scene work best
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when people compare like growing
styles, like how you are growing is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, dude, you're talking to this guy on
Facebook or Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know any any of the details of
this person's needs?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like like person will figure out what
works best for themself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about yelling at them that
they're an idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's that that, yeah,
kind of goes across the entire industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as the industry is like kicking
off and people are much more public with
[SPEAKER_01]: their cannabis usage and growing and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see so much typical human dynamics,
bickering and posturing and comparing and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is important to make that note that
everyone has their own relationship and
[SPEAKER_01]: specific situation that they're in,
that they're going to find things that
[SPEAKER_01]: work for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are lots of options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so getting caught up in trying to
understand what's best right away is just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a it's kind of a fool's errand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's best for you is is definitely a
great message to get out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also just glance at the time,
just notice between our cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've probably gone on for like an hour
and a half here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to be respectful of your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for not noticing that sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this has been a wonderful
conversation, Chango.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish we could go on for another hour
and a half or two, because especially as
[SPEAKER_01]: we get going here and comparing stories
and stuff, there's so much that's popping
[SPEAKER_01]: in my brain, memories and things from the
past 10 years or so that, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's there's so much to learn from,
from where we've come from and where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the last question I'll pose to
you is what do you hope to see from the
[SPEAKER_01]: future as cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I say the cannabis industry,
but when I say the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really just mean the widespread
proliferation and normalization of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, you know, broadly, whether
that's in the legal market or home growing
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, whatever manifestation that
has.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what do you hope to see from the
future of the cannabis industry as we move
[SPEAKER_01]: into, you know, the next several years,
five years or so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, start with the most difficult thing
that I would like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to see more states adopt
and hold a one acre cap like they were
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to have in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the lobbyists got beaten up so
that people are now stacking licenses in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, because originally there was
supposed to be a window of opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: small heritage growers and family farms to
get well established in the market before
[SPEAKER_00]: the big commoditized cannabis companies
were supposed to be able to do anything in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And effective lobbying by big money
totally made that disappear just one night
[SPEAKER_00]: in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was gone and no one was willing to talk
about how that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm hoping that as we see the rise
and strengthen of these MSOs, these multi
[SPEAKER_00]: state operators, which are essentially
like, you know, McDonald's for weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the quality is not, you know,
what it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really commodifies the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that that many states learn from
the California mistake and they create
[SPEAKER_00]: situations in their states that that is
the opposite of what they're doing now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is trying to beckon these multi
state operators so that they can deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer providers and just make the whole
thing easy for themselves instead of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that should be done,
which is letting small players grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: their state and then exporting those
companies to into other states that did
[SPEAKER_00]: not do a one acre cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm asking a lot in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the that's the number one thing
for me is I would love to see something
[SPEAKER_00]: happen where the small guy can start to
compete more effectively with these with
[SPEAKER_00]: these MSOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, no surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited to see the future of
autoflowers.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, we're still very early
in the process and so much has happened in
[SPEAKER_00]: such a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that this is the pool that I'm
swimming in more than, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: than than photo periods, you know,
I still keep my hand in photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but really, I think for the regular
home grower and patients, the future is
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm very excited to see what
happens there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm also excited with the what do
you want to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like like the standardization of cannabis
knowledge, because right now there's still
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of bro science in the teaching of
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people, you know,
like, you know, people thinking they need
[SPEAKER_00]: an indica for this and a sativa for that
when indica and sativa is a is a false
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even exist in reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just shorthand because people aren't
educated properly enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as as, you know, prohibition continues
to melt away into some kind of normalized
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to people more uniformly
understanding how cannabis can help them
[SPEAKER_00]: and relieve their symptoms so that people
are doing less trial and error and more,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I'm using the best practices that we
already learned and shared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say those three things are the
things that you know, are three of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things I'm most excited to see come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those are huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that first one you mentioned,
I know it's a it's a big ask, but I
[SPEAKER_01]: completely agree because once again,
I mean, I saw similar things happen in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon, you know, like starting in these
labs and getting to know these medical
[SPEAKER_01]: growers and these small farms and small
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get emotionally invested in wanting to
see them succeed as the industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to come about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you see them get totally
crushed and basically no hope of being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to participate in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not just sad, like it's it's
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm I want to just echo that that
absolutely that's something that needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: get more attention as more and more states
change their laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I I do worry that we're already
kind of knee deep in this process of kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of excommunicating all of the folks who
got us to this point, basically the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that took the risk early on participating
in either straight out black market or
[SPEAKER_01]: gray, you know, gray market areas that
stuck through medical all the way up to
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're trying to decide what to do
to make a living because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't seem like growing is going to
do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those I'm sad to hear more and more and
more of those stories as more time goes
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know lots of good, great growers that
have abandoned growing because the money
[SPEAKER_01]: is just not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I I totally feel that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one in particular, I just want to
make sure people are really thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, especially if anyone listening to
this has any sway in any of these states
[SPEAKER_01]: that are, you know, currently discussing
legislative changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all great things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I also want to make sure to
give you a chance here in the last few
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let everybody know how to find shaping
fire, the website, social media accounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all fairly easy because if anyone
looks for shaping fire, they should find
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll do the I'll do the plugs anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, do the plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the the center of the shaping fire
universe is at shaping fire dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can listen to podcast episodes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sign up for the newsletter there
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do cool contests for people who are
subscribed to the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend that you you sign up for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the at shaping fire Instagram is
incredibly popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I do, you know, most of my
teaching, both successes and failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, let you know about some of
the stuff I've found in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: technique or or new products that I'm
into, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Instagram's pretty popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a personal Instagram at Shango
Lowe's that's also got, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 followers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a little bit less about the
show and a little bit more about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, farm tours that I've gone on and
just like more interesting things about
[SPEAKER_00]: like me as another cannabis enthusiast,
that stuff that doesn't necessarily fit
[SPEAKER_00]: the shaping fire brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to plug the shaping fire
YouTube channel, which is really different
[SPEAKER_00]: because even though there are certainly
the audio files from the shaping fire
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast are there for you to listen to as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason people love the shaping fire
YouTube channel is because that's where I
[SPEAKER_00]: post all of my random videos from doing
shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get, you know, lots of farm
tours, farm tour outtakes when I go to
[SPEAKER_00]: conventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that I see at the convention,
I record all of those speakers and bring
[SPEAKER_00]: them home for people who don't have access
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The YouTube channel was nothing that I
intended to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just that when I got home from
traveling, I had all these videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the hell am I going to put them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just started dumping them onto
the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, like, you know, there are there
are hundreds of videos there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've got, you know,
ten or 13,000 subscribers and and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we just recently hit like, you know,
our one millionth viewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but the center of that universe is
shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, if you just put shaping fire
in Google, you'll find it all.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go, I also want to thank you,
Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I absolutely see why you got
feedback from people that you and I should
[SPEAKER_00]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have enjoyed this interview a great
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not something I can always say
when I'm on shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're you're we do have a similar
warm cadence and awful approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: interviewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I absolutely see why people suggested
that we meet, because I too share your
[SPEAKER_00]: experience of feeling an immediate kinship
with you and like we could talk for hours
[SPEAKER_00]: and hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so hopefully when when all this COVID
bullshit is done, we can have time to get
[SPEAKER_00]: together and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, something I'm planning to do
whenever it's safe to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had actually planned to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The year COVID hit was I wanted to hit the
road and travel around, meet with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that I had already been meeting for
the podcast and everything, do some on
[SPEAKER_01]: site, you know, live videos and all of
that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that came crashing down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, OK, maybe twenty
twenty one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it didn't happen again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see about 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at some point I will be getting on the
road and trying to connect with folks and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it'd be great to have you up
here for a Vimeo meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we once we restart those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'd really enjoy the vibe scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It even our meetings are even in an old
log Grange hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very it's very old school,
rural romantic, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start doing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you an invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start those back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, there's definitely
when in-person curious about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: events start getting going again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, whenever that happens,
I'll definitely be reaching out to you to
[SPEAKER_01]: connect over that kind of stuff,
too, because, yeah, I'd love to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to you again and work with you any
way we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a great pleasure on my end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, everybody that's listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for tuning in, as always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to learn more about
curious about cannabis, similarly,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you search for curious about cannabis,
you'll find us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our social media tags are all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Instagram is really the main place to
find us at curious about cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_01]: website CAC podcast dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have an app out now,
too, where you can kind of stay connected
[SPEAKER_01]: to all of the curious about cannabis
ecosystem stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can look for that otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone out there, as usual, stay curious
and take it easy.
