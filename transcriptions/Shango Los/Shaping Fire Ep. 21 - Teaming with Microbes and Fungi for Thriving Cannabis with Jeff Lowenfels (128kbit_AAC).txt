[SPEAKER_00]: For decades, it's been the habit of most
cannabis growers to dedicate themselves to
[SPEAKER_00]: using several bottles of various synthetic
nutrients to grow their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've seen in the last few years,
though, is a revival of natural growing
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques that focus on building healthy
soil, which in turn grows thriving plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of dumping raw chemicals into the
soil and demanding it grow, true gardeners
[SPEAKER_00]: are learning to work in cooperation with
the soil and its inhabitants to create the
[SPEAKER_00]: healthiest environment possible for their
plants to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: These natural cannabis growers work with
the soil's microbe communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, and organic food web to strike a
balance where they no longer need to add
[SPEAKER_00]: raw nutrients at all, because the soil
itself contains everything the plant needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to thrive naturally.

that dive deep into cannabis health,
[SPEAKER_00]: business, and technique, I encourage you

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff is author of the award-winning
trilogy of books titled, Teaming with
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes, the Organic Gardener's Guide to
the Soil Food Web, Teaming with Nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Organic Gardener's Guide to Optimizing
Plant Nutrition, and Teaming with Fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Organic Grower's Guide to Mycorrhiza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff writes the longest running gardening
column in the U.S., running 41 years now
[SPEAKER_00]: for the Alaska Dispatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also a lawyer and former TV and radio
show host.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fortunate enough to have the
opportunity to hear Jeff say speak at the
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016 Emerald Cup in Sonoma, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an incredibly lively speaker,
and he kept the room laughing with
[SPEAKER_00]: salacious jokes about fungi in the food
web.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I had to ask him to come on the
show, and he was kind enough to accept the
[SPEAKER_00]: invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Jeff, when I was a kid, the folks on
my block would actually cook their soil in
[SPEAKER_00]: old coffee containers on the grill to make
sure that it was good and dead before
[SPEAKER_00]: adding their store bought inputs and
potting up their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, though, the idea of creating a
living soil community to nourish the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants instead of just adding nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium is really taking
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for many growers, the idea of creating
a self-sustaining soil system instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: just pouring in more fertilizers is a huge
jump in their thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you like to describe living soil in
a way that makes sense to folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: new to thinking about it this way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes me back to my father's
sterilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the biggest compost pile literally
in the town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this was almost half an acre of
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would then take that compost and
put it into a sterilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember how bad it smelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you could sort of say that living
soil is all that smell that occurs when
[SPEAKER_01]: you sterilize soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would start right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, soil is not what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to think it was just this inert
substance that was there to hold plants on
[SPEAKER_01]: which you could put fertilizer and which
allowed water to drain through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We now know that that's absolutely not
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's minerals from rocks that have broken
down over the eons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a tremendous amount of living
organisms which require oxygen and water
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to be able to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's completely different than what it
was when you and I were younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, my dad did that same thing with
taking his soil and sterilizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays, when we think about living
soil, it's much more of a, instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: considering it an inert thing,
it's more about a neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to create a neighborhood of
good nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a good soil situation,
what you've got is a condominium that's
[SPEAKER_01]: operating properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a perfectly constructed
condominium, never needs any repairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all of the inhabitants that you'd
want to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a permanent condominium so that
everybody has fun and they can help each
[SPEAKER_01]: other out and they don't irritate each
other too much and they take care of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bad guys when they appear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fully stocked with great food so
everybody has a great time in that
[SPEAKER_01]: condominium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a condominium that just hums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is the soil food web concept
that's taking over, I think, how we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at not just how we grow cannabis,
but it's how we grow food, it's what we
[SPEAKER_01]: eat, it's how we eat, it's why we eat,
the comparison between the stomach and how
[SPEAKER_01]: it operates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't say the stomach but the
intestines and how it operates versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything ties together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful, beautiful system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because there are so many ways to coax
a biologically active community,
[SPEAKER_00]: a community along in the soil,
what do you see as a good place for a
[SPEAKER_00]: beginner to start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think compost is always the best
place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost contains in it all of the
organisms that you'd really want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to hold the foods that the plants eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess that's the proper term.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of the organisms that eat those
organisms and poop out that food so that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's available in plant usable form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got all of the fungi and the
bacteria, which are at the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's got the nematodes and
protozoa in phenomenal numbers that cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients so that compost becomes
usable from the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And compost is just the easiest thing to
get your hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's easy to buy lousy compost,
but it's also easy to buy good compost and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's easy to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would start right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the be all and beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people have found their way to
either a good source to buy their compost
[SPEAKER_00]: or they've done a little homework and
they've figured out how to make compost at
[SPEAKER_00]: home, most folks tend to move on from that
to nutrient teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're huge fans of nutrient teas here
at Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of your favorite wildcrafted
nutrient teas for encouraging probiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: growth in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, I mean, you're thinking in
terms of the beginner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you take that compost,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have that compost, then you learn
that you can do designer things with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make more fungally dominated
compost or more bacterially dominated
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: For cannabis, you want bacterially
dominated compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and for all sorts of reasons,
you can make teas out of that compost and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make fungally dominated teas or
more fungally dominated teas and and
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterially dominated teas, which you can
use as soil drenches and which you can
[SPEAKER_01]: then spray also on the leaves where the
microbes that are in that compost tea out
[SPEAKER_01]: compete the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, yeah, the bacteria in the
fungi and the nematodes, the bad guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be on those leaves or might get on
those leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you spray good stuff on them,
there's no room for the bad guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no food left for the bad guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no entryways for the bad guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So compost tea, definitely something that
people want to get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: The intermediate step would be compost
extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a brewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a tremendous amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 15 minutes, you can you can take
compost, wrap it up in cheesecloth and
[SPEAKER_01]: just knead it in a couple of gallons of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got an extract of a lot of
those microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't multiplied themselves,
but you've pulled them out of the compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next step, of course,
is the compost teas, which require a
[SPEAKER_01]: brewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's often called fermentation because
you're brewing the tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking energy and you're pulling
out the bacteria in the fungi and the
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes and the protozoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're then feeding them and causing
them to either grow or to multiply or to
[SPEAKER_01]: change their ratios during a 24 to 48 hour
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that to many people is sort of
the ultimate way of adding biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have said so when I wrote Teaming
with Microbes, the first edition back in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm beginning to think that it is
certainly important, but that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: other things that you can do, namely,
mycorrhizal fungi, which which can be
[SPEAKER_01]: added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we already know about adding
nitrogen fixing bacteria to the proper
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I think compost tea is a large
part of a bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you were talking about the
nutrient teas, you were talking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: fungally dominant one and and then or a
bacterially dominant or or bacterially
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, a lot of people who
have not gotten to the point yet where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're prepared for a brewer,
either either they don't quite have the
[SPEAKER_00]: budget yet or they're just, you know,
on their learning path and they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be probably be using more the the
second version that you suggested,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is simply take your compost and put
it in some in some cheesecloth and squeeze
[SPEAKER_00]: it into your five gallon bucket of water
that that has had the chlorine vaped off
[SPEAKER_00]: of it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then use and use that to to water your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some folks still would like to be able
to get that fungally dominant tea effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you suggest a way that we can perhaps
inoculate our compost pile?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be more mycelium there
for when we do this, this squeeze the
[SPEAKER_00]: cheesecloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well, what happens, of course,
is that if you add more brown material to
[SPEAKER_01]: your compost pile, particularly once
you've got that compost cooking and really
[SPEAKER_01]: going, you're breaking down more more
materials which which are likely to feed
[SPEAKER_01]: the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take the the material that you're
going to be using either for your tea or
[SPEAKER_01]: for your compost extract, which is that
second method, and you can inoculate it
[SPEAKER_01]: with foods that will grow the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take that material and you
use it to make your tea or your extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that particular instance,
you can use baby oatmeal, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: ground up barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: But baby oatmeal is probably the easiest
thing to get your hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just simply you mix it in so that
you can see the flakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you keep it in a dark warm area
for 24, 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fungal hyphae will grow and
multiply and form mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can use that block because it
will become a block for your compost here
[SPEAKER_01]: your compost extract, that will be more
fungally dominated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can and I should say you can use
fungal foods in your compost tea,
[SPEAKER_01]: not in the abstract because they're not
there long enough to be able to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a compost tea, the bacteria will start
to multiply in the first 1520 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungus will grow but they really won't
multiply for 24, 48 hours, probably more
[SPEAKER_01]: like 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really what you're doing is growing
them in a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to use foods that will feed
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out molasses will actually feed
compost tea, fungus as well as bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't use too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get a lot of bacteria if you use
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fish hydrolysates will also feed the
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people use green sand in their
compost tea as a substrate to try to feed
[SPEAKER_01]: the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, what you really want to make,
however, for cannabis is a bacterially
[SPEAKER_01]: dominated tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really don't even have to worry too
much about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then like that just begs the
question, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that was a how to make a fungally
dominant, how would we flip to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: side and make it more bacterially
dominant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, remember, I said they multiply
within 20, you know, within 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do nothing to the tea, but just,
you know, aerate it for 24 hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just going to be multiplying because
they'll be living off the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you add molasses, they will go
nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, of course, it's got to be
non-sulphur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll multiply like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will throw a little bit of
alfalfa in their compost teas the last
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of hours because they're covered
with protozoa and they'll multiply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll get a nice little mix that
recycles itself or cycles the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's a pretty interesting
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And above and beyond everything else,
whatever kind of tea you make,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's ultimately up to the plant to adjust
its extracts to be able to attract what it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant will adjust things to make it
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to kind of to summarize that for folks
who are new to this idea, and it isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: just fitting in immediately, you start by
taking some of your finished compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapping it in cheesecloth, squeezing it
into a five gallon bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just sort of kind of kneading it for
15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you wrap it up and you just
knead that cheesecloth for 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just if I can make some sound effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you squeeze these things out
because let me just back up for a second
[SPEAKER_01]: just to make sure for people who really
don't know what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all outlined in the first book,
Teaming with Microbes, which by the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody should get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get it and don't like it,
I'll buy it back at three times the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to you're going to get a lot
of use out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is what's happening is
the plants are putting out chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: through their root system that attract the
bacteria and the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they eat the stuff that the plant's
putting out because it's got a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: carbons in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They in turn attract nematodes and
protozoa who eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They poop the excess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of nutrients in it,
particularly nitrogen, which feeds the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all happening right there in the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant can change those exudates to
attract what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you put down something
and it's something in there the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: wants, it'll change the exudate to attract
what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is in control, not you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, so you need this stuff for 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pull out the nematodes and the
protozoa and the bacteria and the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: and the fungi make soil structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why you've got to use the
energy of your hands to make the compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't just swish your teeth out in the
morning with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brush them with a lot of energy to get
rid of that bacterial slime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you have to do to the
particle of soil to break off that
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and to strip out that fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you use energy and you make this soup
or these teas and then you use them on
[SPEAKER_01]: your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tend to use a, what do you call
it, an aquarium pump that both aerates the
[SPEAKER_00]: tea but then also provides the energy to
break it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that that works good for you
as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because I think unless it's a gigantic
aquarium like the size of the Monterey
[SPEAKER_01]: Aquarium, I think the pump's probably too
small.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the beginning, we used to use those
aquarium pumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of research was done by Dr. Elaine
Ingham who's certainly the goddess of all
[SPEAKER_01]: of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anytime you get a chance to go hear
Dr. Elaine or read anything she's written,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's, what can I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we bow at her feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, those pumps don't provide the
six or seven parts per million air that
[SPEAKER_01]: you really need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you really got to step up the air
if you want to make it really work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I asked that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't use those aquarium stones
either because those stones, when you turn
[SPEAKER_01]: the pump off, fill up with water and it's
got the bacterial slime in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It forms and grows in those little holes
and they're impossible to clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get bad situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after folks have gotten into nutrient
and compost teas, a lot of folks really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy moving on to fermentations and labs
and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your favorite fermentations for
thriving soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I'm not really into them
in a big way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about EM and... Yeah,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to me, if you're using compost
tea, you're getting what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: EM is, it certainly works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people tell me it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use it other than making bokashi
in the wintertime because it's a great way
[SPEAKER_01]: to sort of make compost in a cold climate
in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the winter, without getting smells,
when your pile's not working, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's got, you know, 15, 16 different
microbes in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost tea has 35,000 different microbes
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a world of difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the diversity makes sense when
you believe that it's the plant that's
[SPEAKER_01]: choosing what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to give it as much opportunity to
choose what it really needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like the diversity of compost tea
over these ferments, but I'm certainly not
[SPEAKER_01]: discouraging of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all of them do one thing that's
important and that was sort of outlined in
[SPEAKER_01]: the second book, Teaming with Nutrients,
which I don't guarantee because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a much more difficult book to get
through, but I think it's an important
[SPEAKER_01]: book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the law of return.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we violate the law of return when we
deal with soils because we harvest things
[SPEAKER_01]: from that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff's supposed to fall down and be
decayed and go back in and feed the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: again and feed the soil again and feed the
microbes again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We harvest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're taking stuff away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you put these ferments in,
you're adding some of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've taken away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're helping to rebalance the law of
return.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I follow you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is organic gardener and
[SPEAKER_00]: author, Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow cannabis with sunshine,
you can often feel limited by the seasonal
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grow sustainably and save
money so you use as little electricity as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you haven't studied or implemented
light deprivation techniques into your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, you're leaving a lot of money
on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: By incorporating light deprivation
solutions into your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can often add two or three additional
growing cycles to your year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pencil out the financial benefit
of those additional cycles, you'll realize
[SPEAKER_00]: why commercial scale light deprivation
technology is remaking the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What used to be done by pulling tarps over
hoop houses has been scaled up over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few years in such a way that it's
become mechanized, easy and affordable to
[SPEAKER_00]: even small scale commercial cannabis
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever Flowering Greenhouses is the
industry leader in light deprivation
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse design and operation for the
commercial cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their team of greenhouse experts have been
in the fields of northern California for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades, and they're now building
greenhouses for commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are new to light dep and growing in
greenhouses, I encourage you to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire episode 13 with guest Eric
Branstad of Forever Flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk with Eric about the importance of
intelligent greenhouse management as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as the huge financial benefit of
incorporating light dep techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many aspects of utilizing a
greenhouse that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: From temperature and airflow to light dep
and workflow, Forever Flowering will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you produce crop after crop of well cared
for flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help you retrofit your existing
greenhouse with light dep and other modern
[SPEAKER_00]: systems at a level that fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just starting out, Forever
Flowering can help you plan and build your
[SPEAKER_00]: new greenhouse so that you get started on
the right foot.

[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_00]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum, and that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes sold by True Terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are certified organic, non-GMO,
and food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that they are extracted from
real plant sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no solvents of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, terpenes from True Terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is, other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you stack those terpenes to make
your blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: True Terpenes also have strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset
Sherbet, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: True Terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_00]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_00]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
True Terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: True Terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose True Terpenes for a top-shelf
experience.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Lowes, and our guest
this week is organic gardener and author,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeff, you know, often with crossover
gardeners coming from foods and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamentals over to cannabis, they don't
know too much about cannabis sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, from hearing you today and
more especially listening to your 2017
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Cup presentation, you definitely
seem familiar with growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you learn about growing
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gee, where did I learn about growing
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I guess I was in college,
so back in the, oh my God, it was a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I was in law school when I grew my
first plant, but I've always grown things
[SPEAKER_01]: and cannabis is, you know, and I tell
people, for those who don't know on this
[SPEAKER_01]: broadcast, I write a garden column.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been writing one for, oh my God,
40 some odd years for the Anchorage
[SPEAKER_01]: newspaper in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I write about cannabis now
because it's legal here and I tell people
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't take any real special skills
to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest problem that I am
beginning to notice with growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is that there are too many myths that
people follow without thinking about what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing and why those myths might
have developed and why they might be myths
[SPEAKER_01]: and therefore not fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I started way back when, back in the,
oh I guess back in the late 60s,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: First in my apartment in Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I moved to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember having a couple of cannabis
plants here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was legal because our Supreme Court
back in 1975 came out with a conclusion
[SPEAKER_01]: that our constitution allows you to grow
cannabis privacy of your home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had some cannabis plants growing
on my property and I remember my father
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up to visit and wandering around
saying, gee, what is that plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was the guy that taught me all the
stuff I knew about growing plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: although he had never seen a cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been growing it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been legal here in Alaska,
as I said, since 1975 and therefore I've
[SPEAKER_01]: had a lot of opportunity to practice
without having to worry about the law
[SPEAKER_01]: coming down on my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it must be really exciting for you,
you know, with your relationship with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant going so far back and now suddenly
people asking you more questions about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis instead of, you know,
the more traditional gardening topics that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might get through your column.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be interesting and exciting for
you to be able to, you know, talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: about this plant that you love now that
it's, you know, it's being normalized
[SPEAKER_00]: across the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean the most interesting thing is
first of all that my, both of my
[SPEAKER_01]: publishers, Timber Press, which has
published all three of my books,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, said this book's got to have
cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had they said that to me in 2006,
teeming with microbes would have been all
[SPEAKER_01]: about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my publisher in my newspaper also has
said, gee, in your column we'd like you to
[SPEAKER_01]: address cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't have to disguise it as a
tomato plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really quite a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The excitement is that cannabis growers,
as you know, are some of the finest
[SPEAKER_01]: growers in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they, I shouldn't say growers,
finest gardeners in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the opportunity to be able to kick
around questions and things about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and to learn things from them is exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, you know, speaking of
tomatoes, Anne Landers, if she was a
[SPEAKER_01]: garden columnist, would have said,
how many times can you repeat a tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: column?
[SPEAKER_01]: To get something new to be able to write
about and something with so much to write
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am convinced on a gardening side
that cannabis is the next tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the tomato has always been the
holy grail of the home gardener to grow a
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful tomato, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I think now, we're going to see
cannabis replacing the tomato as,
[SPEAKER_01]: as the holy grail plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that sounds like such a beautiful
vision right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in fact, it's not even a vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that the three of us are
going to be speaking at the garden writers
[SPEAKER_01]: associations conference, the national
conference on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be speaking about how you
write about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for a generalized public,
we've got a gentleman is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking about the breeding efforts that
are going on so that it's available as a,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a, you know, outdoor six pack plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A gentleman who's very, very heavily
involved in, in micro propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third part of the speaker is
going to be somebody who's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: pointing out, you know, some of the
stupidity that people have bought into
[SPEAKER_01]: that has resulted in the stigma that makes
it difficult to write about the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time ever this national
organization has had a conversation about
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant that I'm virtually certain three
quarters of them use, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so nice to see, you know,
we're essentially priming the pump of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the next generation of educators to
reach out to even more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I spend a lot of time speaking
with, with doctors and naturopaths and
[SPEAKER_00]: other caregivers about how to work with
patients and their endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, I'm creating new educators
similarly with the event that you've just
[SPEAKER_00]: described.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are educating gardening writers how to
then reach out to their following and
[SPEAKER_00]: teach them how to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how, you know, these are force
multipliers of education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in once, trust me, once the garden
writers start writing about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: we reach and I, and we say garden writers,
but these are the folks that do television
[SPEAKER_01]: shows and you know, podcasts and radio
shows and newspaper columns and magazine
[SPEAKER_01]: columns and books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they start writing about cannabis on
a regular basis, the same way they write
[SPEAKER_01]: about tomatoes, it's over folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care whether it's Jeff Sessions,
you know, his mother or his grandmother,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's over because it's just a plant folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that could be a good book title.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy seeing all the people who
have not ever really kept a garden before
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly decide they want to start growing
food because they've had such a good
[SPEAKER_00]: experience growing their first couple of
cannabis plants and then realizing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that more than anything, cannabis is
actually a gateway to gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, it's an easy plant to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll admit to grow, to grow really
great cannabis takes a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but once, once you grow a nice
cannabis plant, you say, Whoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I could, I can grow anything and
you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a fun plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of little tricks,
but once you, once you nail those down,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, what a fun plan to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get back into the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, gardeners use a lot of
nutrients as we were talking about in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first set.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see as a good model of
recycling these nutrients back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem in a sustainable way after you
harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good model of recycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think what you're really
describing is sort of regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I understand your question
properly, there are a number of things
[SPEAKER_01]: that I do to try to, again, it all goes
back to this law of return that I,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I try to do in order to balance the
fact that I've broken the law of return.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess do my time is the proper term.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, I reuse my soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people throw their soils
out at a minimum, put the soils in a
[SPEAKER_01]: compost pile, let them compost for a
season or two, and then reuse them after
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I reuse my soil right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't disturb the roots that are in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let that organic matter become available
to the microbes and therefore the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: system itself during the growth of the
next plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let that root system act as a guideway
for the new roots of the plants that I
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I let the mycorrhizal network,
which I know has developed in that pot or
[SPEAKER_01]: in that garden bed, remain undisturbed so
that it going out to get goodies,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm adding into the garden or into
the pot by A, using soluble organics and
[SPEAKER_01]: B, putting compost and organics on the
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any leaves that come off the plant on the
surface, any sticks and stems either go
[SPEAKER_01]: into the compost pile that then goes on
the plant or go right on the surface of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always, always have mulch whenever
I'm growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually sounds like that's a
no-till technique, really, but in a
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my next question was actually going to
wrap into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you if you think it
makes more sense to no-till and simply
[SPEAKER_00]: replant in the same pot using fresh top
amendments that'll get watered in,
[SPEAKER_00]: or are you more a fan of emptying the pots
in the pile and then mending the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: pile?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like you're of the mind that
no, just pop out the top of the root
[SPEAKER_00]: system of the prior plant and then just
put your new start right on in that same
[SPEAKER_00]: hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think you can do it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you probably can't do it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to keep an eye on what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's certainly worth people
experimenting and trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other system works as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, gee, you've done a lot of work for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a male plant, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just throw them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: That male plant has been throwing out the
exudates that a cannabis plant throws out
[SPEAKER_01]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you get rid of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's full of these wonderful, delicious
exudates, as Elaine says, cooking candies
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff that these microbes love.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to throw it out just because
it's a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut off the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You compost the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You keep that soil and you plant right in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got all the exudates you need right
away to start with.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it just makes logical sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've written three books on the
subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier, you were talking about
Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bokashi really seems to be taking
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those who don't know, it's a
fermented, inoculated, fermented brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have any tips or insight that
you'd like to offer on making or using it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've probably come across some
over the days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's supposed to be a proprietary
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to buy it only from people
who've got licenses, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go on the internet,
and I won't do it for you, but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly use Google, which is the
cannabis grower's finest tool,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can find all sorts of recipes to make
your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very easy to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use some of your old Bokashi
to inoculate the stuff that you've used.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, to me, compost is much better
than using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't figure out why it's taken
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes we keep on coming back
to compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me think that sometimes
people like to get more complex just for
[SPEAKER_00]: the complexity sake because they're active
learners, and they're curious,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want to do more and more stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we keep on circling back,
would you say that using a quality compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea is, I'm going to air quotes this,
but all you need, that really keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you use the compost tea,
you're going to get where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to learn this extra stuff,
by all means, do it for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, you're adding icing on an
already done cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it depends on what you're growing
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you've got phenomenal soil,
like we have here in Alaska, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea is all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our soil is full of volcanic ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all the minerals you'd ever want,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I understand and I believe that
it is possible to grow plants without ever
[SPEAKER_01]: adding anything other than the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No question in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that takes longer than you want to
wait, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've got a season.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to wait three seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a business, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so adding stuff is not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using just compost tea can certainly
work if you've got the right soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: but each to his own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to do some testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I am a big believer in banding
organics underneath plants when I put them
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean I wrote Otil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put in a seed or you put in a
transplant, you make a hole for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can put a little fertilizer in
down at the bottom of that hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make the hole a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to rototilt the whole area
to destroy it and still be able to apply
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers, or what I call micro-foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly, by all means, you can use
solubles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly, by all means, you would
want to use mulches and compost I include
[SPEAKER_01]: as one of those mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that term you use that's new to
me, banding organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you take a look at my second
book, which is called, what is my second
[SPEAKER_01]: book called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, it's got the most- Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if I may just digress for a
second, I'm going to write this second
[SPEAKER_01]: book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I had nothing else to do,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because I was curious about how plants
ate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought it was going to be
teaming with nutrients, how plants eat,
[SPEAKER_01]: an organic gardener's guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came, you know, teaming with
nutrients, organic gardeners, a guide to
[SPEAKER_01]: optimizing plant nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, you know, you learn how plants
eat, what they take in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the methods, of course,
well, there's three ways plants get their
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is by flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, it's in water,
it's soluble, and it goes into the root
[SPEAKER_01]: system by mass flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other is by osmosis diffusion,
which, you know, you struggle through in
[SPEAKER_01]: 10th grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: The osmosis diffusion, you know,
that's really sort of when you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: direct contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got mycorrhizal fungi that
go out into the little pores and bring
[SPEAKER_01]: food back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forgot exactly what you were asking
me about, but- I was just asking you to
[SPEAKER_00]: define the banding organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you band below where you're
planting, and by banding, you just put a
[SPEAKER_01]: little flat area in there, and you just
put your fertilizer right down there,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I call it microbe food, maybe a little
soil on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you put either your transplant or
your seed so that the roots grow out into
[SPEAKER_00]: that band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, you're creating a preset
buffet of nutrients, and then the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing, you know, aspiring for
nutrients, and then they grow down,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they hit that band, and then
they're waiting for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the band is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already replenished what's in that
little zone as they're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mycorrhizal fungi, which you've also
inoculated your seeds and your roots with,
[SPEAKER_01]: are growing and are going out into that
band and bringing that food back quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's that little bit of food in
there that you could add.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you break that law of return by
removing the cannabis plant, then if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to use the same soil,
you've got to return the nutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: would have decayed had you not removed
that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I say in my talks, whoever fertilizes
the redwoods, how do they get that big?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody ever puts fertilizer down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody puts Miracle Grow down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody uses general hydroponic crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: How'd that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the law of return wasn't ignored,
wasn't broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that stuff fell down and decayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fascinating, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second book, Teeming with
Nutrients, which people should read and
[SPEAKER_01]: struggle through, because it's important
to know, it's got some chemistry in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I apologize, but it's got the least
amount of chemistry I could put in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I promised myself I would never ever
talk about the Krebs cycle, and so it's no
[SPEAKER_01]: Krebs cycle in it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think I have the formula for
photosynthesis in it, so people don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got sort of a picture of how you
would band, as well as a description of
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the things you might use in order
to make that band.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw you in December at the Emerald
Cup, I'm going to paraphrase this poorly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you'll know where I'm going,
and you can take it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were talking about some of the topics
from your Teeming with Fungi book,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you were talking about that you
recommend it for cannabis folks to roll
[SPEAKER_00]: their seeds in a particular fungus to
support them as soon as they pop,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was taking as many notes as I can,
but I missed which mycorrhizae it was and
[SPEAKER_00]: what your actual strategy was,
and it was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that setup, will you just kind of
deliver that little nugget to everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will, but you put me in a very
difficult position, see?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me back up for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I've got a trilogy of books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, which I'm supposed to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say I make my living, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last book is Teeming with,
so I call myself Lord of the Roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: incidentally, because I have this trilogy,
ba-bump-bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my last book is Teeming with Fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: People should go out and buy it and find
where that one is in the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always go so fast when I talk so that
people can't write it down, so they will
[SPEAKER_01]: go out and buy the book, but I know
everybody's going to go out and buy the
[SPEAKER_01]: book anyway, so I'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's quickly go back a little bit and
talk about these mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninety-six percent of the plants on the
planet Earth have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the reason why plants were able to
colonize terra firma 400 million years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, and 200 million years ago,
a second type developed, and this second
[SPEAKER_01]: type of mycorrhizal fungi does exactly
what the first one does, only in a
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly different fashion, and that is in
return for these exudates, which we talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about at the beginning of the program,
these guys take the exudates from the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant by literally taking it from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're inside the plant, living inside
the plant, and the other end of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: outside the plant, and in return for those
exudates, they go out and get all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, which they then transfer to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't transfer them to the
plant, then the plant doesn't get to give
[SPEAKER_01]: them the exudates, so this is a very
symbiotic relationship, and they get
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, phosphorus, those two in
particular, but copper and zinc and a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of the M's, which I always forget,
it's just going right out of my mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: manganese, and anyway, they go out and get
all these terrific things that the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: can't get itself, and so they feed the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're very, very important and we
know of about 360 different kinds,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that we can only grow about 15 of
them, and if you buy a package of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: called mycorrhizal fungi, even though it
may say mycorrhizae, it's really called
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mycorrhizae is the symbiotic relationship
that forms, and it always includes a root,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's not the right term for what's in
the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that there are about eight or
nine of them listed on that package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only one of them happens to associate and
form that relationship with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this particular one forms that
association with cannabis sativa,
[SPEAKER_01]: indica, rudialis, it doesn't matter
whether it's Durbin poison, jacarara,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's teeming with microbe,
no, there is no one called teeming with
[SPEAKER_01]: microbe yet, but it doesn't matter what it
is, there's only one that feeds these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, and it is called, so get the pens
and paper out, oh, wait a minute,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started writing the book,
it was called Glomus mossi, M-O-S-S-A-E-A,
[SPEAKER_01]: or A, the Latin, mossi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glomus, G-L-O-M-A, Glomus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, or fortunately,
I guess, over the two or three years,
[SPEAKER_01]: three years that it took me to write the
book, the genetics of these individual
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungi became important enough
to know that they began to study them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they have now reassigned the names of
all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: My poor editor had to go back through the
book and rewrite all of these Latin names.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we've got second editions,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not that easy to write.
[SPEAKER_01]: A second edition, people don't understand,
just as an aside, a second edition,
[SPEAKER_01]: they say, okay, if you can take out six
words, you can put in six words.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not that easy to write.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't just say, oh, hey, it's four,
you get, you know, put in a new chapter.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you, ah, anyway, to go back,
the one that you want is now called
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizophagus, R-H-I-Z-O-P-H-A-G-U-S,
rhizophagus, intra, I-N-T-R-A,
[SPEAKER_01]: intraracides, R-A-C-I-D-E-S, rhizophagus
with a capital R, interracides with a
[SPEAKER_01]: small I.
[SPEAKER_01]: But many times in the package,
you'll see it as glomus mossi,
[SPEAKER_01]: or as glomus interracides, or as ragofagus
mossi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very confusing, but you get the
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you got, we've got our key search
terms now, and, you know, that should get
[SPEAKER_00]: us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, hopefully everybody who's
listening is super geeked about this now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find links to the Teaming with
Fungi book on the Shaping Fire podcast on
[SPEAKER_00]: the episode page for this interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, it's an easy thing to
find on Amazon if you want to go there on
[SPEAKER_00]: your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so let's go ahead and take our
second break.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get back, we're going to take some
questions from the show audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: How exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is organic gardener and
[SPEAKER_00]: author Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using pesticides when growing cannabis has
been common for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, though, we know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that most pesticides formulated
for food crops have never been tested for
[SPEAKER_00]: use with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested to be eaten in tiny
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not been tested to be inhaled,
and especially not concentrated into a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical residues from pesticides are not
healthy for anyone, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: especially dangerous for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: For commercial cannabis growers,
this has become very impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis enthusiasts and patients have
gotten educated enough that they avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who used pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but states across the
country have begun making pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: testing mandatory on all licensed cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time has come to find a better way to
fight garden pests than covering your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and chemicals, and there is a
better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let some good bugs fight your bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects and predatory mites
have come a long way since we were buying
[SPEAKER_00]: ladybugs online and putting them in the
grow room and just hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies Biocontrol can help you
solve pest issues without using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies founder Shane Young
learned best practices from working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry and has
fine-tuned those strategies specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: for large cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane works with commercial cannabis
clients across the country to ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they keep their crops safe and pest-free
without the use of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies has proven solutions for
spider mites, aphids, thrips, russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, broad mites, shoreflies,
whitefly, and others too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rely on Natural Enemies for
expertise and excellent service.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is organic
gardener and author, Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during this last set, we're gonna take
some questions from the Shaping Fire
[SPEAKER_00]: audience that I asked for a couple of
weeks ago since I knew that you were gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first question is from Mike West.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike asks, since most of the plants'
cannabinoids are created by enzymatic
[SPEAKER_00]: bio-pathways, but the precursors are
provided by symbiotic relationships,
[SPEAKER_00]: would Jeff please describe the
microbiology biosynthesis of terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid precursors in the roots as
well as foliar biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you have for that there,
Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, you know, now, see,
this felt, Mike should read my second
[SPEAKER_01]: book, Teaming with Nutrients, because it
really sort of discusses that in a much
[SPEAKER_01]: simpler way.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I think he's saying is, listen,
all of these things are built inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, but they're created using the
enzymes inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The enzyme factories make all of the
things that are inside a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll go back and discuss that in a
quick second.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of the enzymes are taking goods
that come from the soil through a
[SPEAKER_01]: biological pathway, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes mineralize it and make it
available to the plant, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungi go out and get it and
bring it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's kind of an
interesting, it gets converted inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant from one sort of energy outside the
plant to another kind inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me just back up for a second and
say that the second book, and one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons why people find it a little bit
complicated, talks about how plants eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't talk about how plants eat
unless you talk about cellular biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first book is microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbiology is a lot of fun because we
studied it in high school, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we know paramecium and amoebas
and all that kind of stuff, and it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of fun because, you know, we're
bacteriophobes as a group, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, fungophobes, and so to study
them and read about them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology is fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, cellular biology was
always a pain in the butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't see the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to use microscopes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in microscopes, you couldn't see
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to use pictures in books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was two dimensions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, on the other hand, it is not only
sort of fun because we have electron
[SPEAKER_01]: microscopes, and now we know a lot more
about what happens inside the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as gardeners and growers of cannabis,
there's a need to know what goes on in
[SPEAKER_01]: cellular biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens in the soil is described
in the first book, teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, those three methods that I
described before are used to bring in
[SPEAKER_01]: individual nutrients into the plant,
and the nutrients enter the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there are only 18 of them,
and they enter the plant each through
[SPEAKER_01]: their own gateway and their own gateway
through each individual cell in the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and each cannabis plant might have 20
trillion individual cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one of them has a plasma membrane
just inside the cell wall, and that plasma
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane has these little tunnels and
gateways, and each individual tunnel takes
[SPEAKER_01]: in only one kind of nutrient molecule,
and each one of those gateways is
[SPEAKER_01]: constructed by the enzymes as is the
plasma derma, which is that plasma
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane, as is the cell wall,
and as is every single thing made inside
[SPEAKER_01]: the cell by using enzymes, and each
individual cell has 10,000 or more
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds of enzymes, and at least
1,000 of each one of them in an individual
[SPEAKER_01]: cell in which a cannabis plant or of which
a cannabis plant might have 20 to 30
[SPEAKER_01]: trillion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these enzymes take these individual 18
elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't play cards with 18 cards,
but they're able to convert these 18
[SPEAKER_01]: elements into every single thing you see
in a plant, and therefore every single
[SPEAKER_01]: thing basically you see in an animal
because that animal, you may not be a
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetarian, but that animal you eat is,
and they're eating plants which are made
[SPEAKER_01]: up of these cells which have all these
enzymes which have made up every little
[SPEAKER_01]: piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mind-boggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Mike should read the second book
and with that question in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's a really on-point
answer too because you mentioned about at
[SPEAKER_00]: the cellular level, we can't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I actually asked for questions
for you, Trent Rinke wrote in and he says,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, tell Jeff that his three books caused
me to buy my first high-powered
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that you flush your plants or
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't understand either of these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to say you can't understand why you
shouldn't flush and you can't understand
[SPEAKER_01]: even the use of hydroponics if you don't
understand the cellular biology involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is fascinating and it's very,
very important for the grower that's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to grow good organic weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also important from a
philosophical perspective because you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't help reading the second book,
walking away with the idea that,
[SPEAKER_01]: wait a second, maybe you and I are just
part of a big cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're two enzymes and these ideas that
we're kicking back and forth are like that
[SPEAKER_01]: enzyme making, we're making ideas here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these ideas build up and all of a
sudden somebody comes a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, wow, this is the same thing that
happens inside an individual cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we're just one of 37 trillion cells
in a gigantic cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a difference of magnitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just read these books.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to sit back after you read them
and ingest a little bit of this wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical and let the cannabinoids help you
think about what you're doing from a 360
[SPEAKER_01]: degree way up in the air view.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have the science from these
books, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say in that last bit that you
don't recommend flushing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't recommend flushing and I
don't recommend using kelp for the reason
[SPEAKER_01]: that people use kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant has these 18 nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put kelp down, it's got 56,
62 nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need the rest of those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put the kelp down to feed the soil
food web, yes, but not to feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then flushing, I mean, why do people
flush?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're feeding your plant properly and
it's growing properly, it's balanced
[SPEAKER_01]: properly, what are you flushing out?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you flush out?
[SPEAKER_01]: You flush out carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can't think of anything else you
can flush out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it seems to be a holdover from
people still using bottled salt nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the hardcore probatic growers
are like, eh, what's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're all green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, even with the salts, I mean,
I got a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you grow hydroponically,
basically, as far as I'm concerned,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can almost always taste the chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can flush all you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think you're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another question comes in from Sea Bass
Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked, what mycelium from my home
garden or a nearby forest could I dig up
[SPEAKER_00]: and use on my kelp?
[SPEAKER_00]: What plants or trees in nature would
provide good mycelium starts for me to mix
[SPEAKER_00]: into my soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, first of all, not from your
trees, because your trees use the other
[SPEAKER_01]: kind, which is the ectomycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And notice I say cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think using the word marijuana is still
racist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was racist when it started back in the
1930s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the word cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It curdles me that Alaska, for example,
has the marijuana act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon has the Oregon Marijuana Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it should be called cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, where was that question again?
[SPEAKER_01]: What mycelium from the home garden can be
used?
[SPEAKER_01]: Trees, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trees, no good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis requires that one that I
mentioned, the rhizophagus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhizophagus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all wrote it down, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get it from carrots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think peonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some things that you grow in
your garden that also use the same fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why not use your previous plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's their main source.
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly hope it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's certainly there if you put it
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes a great deal of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that I think people are
beginning to notice, at least I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: told this number of people who do know,
and that is that when you grow in a
[SPEAKER_01]: container, you get some pretty quick
multiplication of the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you grow in a field situation or a
big bed situation, you get the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that when that mycelium
is broken up, it will produce propagules
[SPEAKER_01]: that will grow into the, or will actually
act as spores and grow new fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty cheap to buy, particularly
when you know that you only need the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets more expensive when you're buying
seven and eight or nine different kinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that you know what to look for on
the package, you just buy the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to be thinking that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's kind of a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listener Tony Leyva of Boneyard Seeds and
the Emerald Triangle down there writes to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask if you have any particular cannabis
cultivars that you personally like for
[SPEAKER_00]: ease of growth, yield, and the terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, my all time favorite is
Durban Poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, who doesn't like Durban Poison?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick Grower, beautiful plant,
best terpene taste I can think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Alaska, you know, we've had a
funny, funny situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been legal here in Alaska in the
privacy of your home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tent, hotel room, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been growing here forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for years and years and years,
we grew two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first was what people, you know,
euphemistically call MTF.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know whether we all had,
but it was always the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for, I swear to God, for five or 10
years, we were all smoking the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it got pretty boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Northern Lights appeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, of course, we've got
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've got a very interesting problem
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is our day length situation does
not coincide properly with the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you live in Alaska,
you have this wonderful burst of daylight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you use light deprivation,
you can have a phenomenal crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've just got a regular backyard
greenhouse, it gets cold before the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: sets the flowers fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first year ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were just rejoicing beyond
belief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're limited to what we can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people grow auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when you grow auto flowers,
you don't end up with clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't end up with giving seeds to
other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there really isn't sort of a,
you know, what do you like to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to grow auto flowers because
they're easy, but see, they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but to go back again, if I had my way,
oh God, the whole world would be growing
[SPEAKER_01]: Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last question for you, Mike
Flanagan writes in, to ask about your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, and interestingly enough,
teaming with microbes, which has been
[SPEAKER_01]: translated into, I think, nine languages
now, was early on translated into Korean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't figure out why.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called kumsumida amoeba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every now and then I'll go into a
Korean restaurant here in Anchorage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to bring the book with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That and, and $16.50 gets me a pretty good
Korean meal here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, you know, it is a,
it is a form of soil food web gardening,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, if that's what you want to call
using beneficial organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's, you know, it's,
it's very similar to EM, lactic acid
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got about six or seven or eight
really key bacterias.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, cycles the nutrients,
uses mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's not different from a soil
food web system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that there's a bunch of
different ways that to add amendments so
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's, for example, fermented fruit
juices and fermented plant juices and
[SPEAKER_01]: amino acid juices and also all sorts of
nutrient mixes that you can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think, you know, I mean,
I think it certainly works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it is a variation of adding either
foods or minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, or minerals are some of the foods,
foods or microbes so that the soil food
[SPEAKER_01]: web will give the plant the microbes it
needs to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, you know, it's a lot of work,
but I, you know, and it's very interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: and I can't see how you can't go through
the Korean system without learning a
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendous amount of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like biodynamic farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's for, for somebody who's
moved beyond their compost teas and the
[SPEAKER_00]: basics, Korean natural farming,
and even very specifically the fermented,
[SPEAKER_00]: the juice ferment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, are, are really exciting and nerdy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I mean, but I think there's
also animal involvement and all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah, I mean, you know,
and let's face it, there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: spectacular, spectacular farms and gardens
in Korea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must work.
