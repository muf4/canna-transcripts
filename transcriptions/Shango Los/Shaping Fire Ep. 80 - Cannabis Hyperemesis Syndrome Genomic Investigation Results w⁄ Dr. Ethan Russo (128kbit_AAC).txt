[SPEAKER_01]: It annoys me so much when prohibitionists
try to tell me there is something wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to practice calmness in the face of
this idiocy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine my frustration when
reports began being published that some
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis users were becoming weak and
nauseous with abdominal pain and in need
[SPEAKER_01]: of hot showers because of their heavy
cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, as someone who attracts cannabis
patients like I do, I learned that there
[SPEAKER_01]: really seemed to be something going on
because of an increasing number of cases
[SPEAKER_01]: being called cannabis hyperemesis syndrome
in the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet I remain skeptical and curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis social media was apoplectic about
CHS and arguments about if it existed and
[SPEAKER_01]: if it was caused by Neem or Eagle 20 or
any other additive were really common.
[SPEAKER_01]: This week, lead author Dr. Ethan Russo has
released the first original research on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis hyperemesis syndrome and they
have discovered the genetic markers behind
[SPEAKER_01]: CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: An understanding of what triggers the
expression of those genetics is vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis is clearly one of them.

[SPEAKER_01]: Today, my guest is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Russo is a board certified
neurologist and former senior medical
[SPEAKER_01]: advisor to GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: He served as study physician to GW
Pharmaceuticals for three phase three
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials of Sativex.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has held faculty appointments in
pharmaceutical sciences at the University
[SPEAKER_01]: of Montana, in medicine at the University
of Washington, and has visiting
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals as a professor at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been president of the International
Cannabinoid Research Society and is former
[SPEAKER_01]: chairman of the International Association
for Cannabinoid Medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1995, he pursued a three month
sabbatical doing ethnobotanical research
[SPEAKER_01]: with indigenous people in Peru.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ethan Russo is author of several books
of cannabis medicine and has published
[SPEAKER_01]: over 30 articles in neurology,
pain management, cannabis, and
[SPEAKER_01]: ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Russo has joined us before on Shaping
Fire, episode 22 on treating traumatic
[SPEAKER_01]: brain injury with cannabis and mushrooms,
and episodes 11 and 27 about his famous
[SPEAKER_01]: research papers on cannabinoids and
terpenoids, and episode number 67 about
[SPEAKER_01]: treating migraines with mushrooms and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the Shaping Fire sessions
on the Shaping Fire YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we offer Dr. Russo's first public
interview on the results of his
[SPEAKER_01]: groundbreaking paper on cannabis
hyperemesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, let's start out by getting
a little bit of context.
[SPEAKER_01]: While there's been a lot of social media
discussion for what would become known as
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in the
last three years, the original index case
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, way before it was named
goes all the way back to 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: How has interest in this syndrome
increased over these 25 years or so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it has a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been increasing recognition of it
so that diagnosis has become a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it still remains the case that
people that have it often have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through many hospitalizations or ER visits
before it's identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is increasingly common in relation to
more potent material, meaning that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis being higher in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, it still would have to be
considered an uncommon condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: but one that is important to recognize.
[SPEAKER_01]: That original case back in 1996,
what about it made it stand out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's some time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, did they just say,
oh, this person got really high and
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore, you know, we're going to tie
this to THC or was it not even originally
[SPEAKER_01]: tied to THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, this is in Australia and it
was published along with about eight other
[SPEAKER_00]: cases only in 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was only after a series of patients
who were high cannabis users and were with
[SPEAKER_00]: close questioning that the pattern was
identified and recognized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over these 25 years or so, what do you
think was the main feature that caused the
[SPEAKER_01]: interest to increase?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it just simply the increased use of
cannabis and therefore, there were just
[SPEAKER_01]: statistically more cases of it and so
there was more ability to look at it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was there some change in, you know,
scientific policy or a particular grant
[SPEAKER_01]: that broke the right way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what has increased the interest in
it where people are actually looking at it
[SPEAKER_01]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it goes along with liberalization of
cannabis laws in many jurisdictions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but most particularly with the increasing
availability of high potency material such
[SPEAKER_00]: as in vape pens and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there's the recognition factor
at all enters into the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see multiple things happening at the
same time making for this opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hyperamnesis syndrome is described,
you know, mostly by or at least up until
[SPEAKER_01]: now as a basket of symptoms, a basket of
these common symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you describe them for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very stereotype syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it includes are cycles of severe
nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're accompanied by a very
characteristic finding that is of the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who are afflicted with it
engaging in hot showers and bathing almost
[SPEAKER_00]: in a compulsive fashion, sometimes hours a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is really what we call the
patho-pneumonic sign, the sign that
[SPEAKER_00]: clinches it when it's combined with the
other symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it because, well, it's interesting
that you would say hot showers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not talking cold showers because
they might have a fever or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want hot showers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the afflicted patient know why they
want to take hot showers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's their motivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they think they want to go take a
hot shower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually people are not aware of the
condition and that this is an accoutrement
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may just notice on a day when
they're having abdominal pain and nausea
[SPEAKER_00]: that the time they're in the shower,
they feel better temporarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, humans notice patterns
and eventually they come to realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is making them feel better and they
pursue it sometimes hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a frequent occurrence that the
hot water runs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually they end up in the
emergency room with an extensive
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say that the syndrome has got
stereotyped syndrome, that sounds like the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical use of the term stereotype because
I didn't hear you describe any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like stoner stereotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does stereotype symptoms mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means in this instance that you see the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone has this syndrome,
they're going to have all these features,
[SPEAKER_00]: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
and the hot shower behavior, bathing
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: In contrast, say, for example,
if we were talking about lupus where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're, yeah, it's another basket of
symptoms, but of the 30 symptoms,
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody might have their particular four
or five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of a mix and match,
pretty much everybody has most of these
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms or if not all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of people are going to
manifest all of these four features.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anybody died yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there've been two clear
cases on, you know, this was not related
[SPEAKER_00]: to an overdose per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, they died of complications of the
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone vomits repeatedly, eventually
it's going to cause chemical imbalances,
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with the electrolytes,
the minerals in the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there've been two documented cases of
deaths and question and a third.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there may have been others,
but there've been two reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's look at the symptoms from a
slightly different perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we've talked about them so far,
we've been talking about these established
[SPEAKER_01]: stereotyped symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking, we're able to look at
them in hindsight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give us a first-person perspective
of the patient and what they would
[SPEAKER_01]: experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are the first ones to come on
and how can a patient delineate between
[SPEAKER_01]: these and, you know, maybe like smoking
while they have the flu or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how do they know when they should be
like thinking about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's set up a sort of archetypal
patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This presents in phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis hyperemesis or hyperemesis
syndrome is going to appear in someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: uses cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually it's going to be a high-volume
user, most often of high potency material,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning high in THC, and on a regular
basis, most often daily or more than
[SPEAKER_00]: daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the phases are these.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's what's called a prodrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means an initial stage where while
people are using cannabis, they may
[SPEAKER_00]: develop nausea and vomiting along with
anxiety and some sweating behavior,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, things that go along with
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second phase is clearer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to have the hyperemesis
along with the abdominal pain and the hot
[SPEAKER_00]: water bathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third is recovery,
which happens only following abstinence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, as long as someone continues to
use cannabis, even in lower amounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're usually going to be at risk for
having episodic attacks of a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when we're talking about the volume of
THC that is required, and we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the other requirements or what we
are seeing along with the THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: but specifically on the THC, you're saying
like high amounts, and you're saying that,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, so we're seeing more of this as
flowers getting stronger and we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration and high THC edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it matter if somebody smokes a little
low THC flower every day versus somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: who dabs on the weekends, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe over the course of the week,
they're going to get the same amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, but in one time, you're going to get
it all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other person, they're going
to get a little bit every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to understand the nature of the
threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, that's going to vary with the
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, once the syndrome has
become established, the threshold is not
[SPEAKER_00]: very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, if someone's been in
remission after abstinence from cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while, we find that they often will
resume pretty soon afterwards,
[SPEAKER_00]: not long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it usually goes along with
establishing, again, some degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when somebody begins to escalate their
dose to achieve their desired level of
[SPEAKER_00]: high, often they'll have a recurrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, to mention your example,
this could occur in either context,
[SPEAKER_00]: the low volume user during the week or the
dabber during the weekend, but I'm afraid
[SPEAKER_00]: there'd be no guarantees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people can try to skirt the edges of
this, but they're usually quite
[SPEAKER_00]: unsuccessful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I can imagine that, and we'll talk
a lot more about the genetic makeup of
[SPEAKER_01]: these patients during the second set,
but I would think that at the top of that
[SPEAKER_01]: list would be somebody who dabs every day,
because these are the people in our
[SPEAKER_01]: community who are getting the highest
amounts of THC every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, how about with edibles as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that the mode of using THC matters
a lot for a whole range of body responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are people who are taking high levels of
THC from edibles having these experiences
[SPEAKER_01]: as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they certainly may.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our survey, people had mixed methods of
administration, but most prevalent were
[SPEAKER_00]: either smoking a flower or high potency
inhalation by whatever method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the most frequent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's nothing to say that using an
edible would prevent this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it's going to be tough for
someone who's in the midst of an episode
[SPEAKER_00]: of susceptibility to keep material down in
an edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the fact that this research,
it was done as a survey plus a genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of it, it's interesting because it
kind of shows two sides of the coin.
[SPEAKER_01]: On one side, you're asking people about
their use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the second side, you're
actually, you know, running, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking a look, a short read of their
genetics to find out what you can find in
[SPEAKER_01]: common.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would have, I can't help but
have some amount of awareness that people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't usually want to talk about their
cannabis use because of its historically
[SPEAKER_01]: being, you know, prohibited and taboo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you explain how the survey
functions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, you and I have talked
off mic about this before, and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a lot of good feels and a lot
of confidence in the information that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting from these surveys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we'd all like to understand
how that works when the basis of the
[SPEAKER_01]: survey is asking questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, this is all
anonymized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you ask me who was in it,
I couldn't tell you, except for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of people who have told me themselves
after the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great pains were taken to protect
people's identities, especially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: instance of taking their genetic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a highly formalized procedure of
ensuring that that information can't
[SPEAKER_00]: escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and this went, the other layer of
protection was that this went through
[SPEAKER_00]: what's called an institutional review
board, an ethics committee to ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: there'd be no danger to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes being identified when
they do not wish to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it hard to communicate the safety idea
to people who are doing a study on
[SPEAKER_01]: something that may even be illegal where
they live?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sure has been in the past, a little bit
less now with the liberalization of laws,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it remains an issue, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like actually your use of the word
liberalization of laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't heard anybody use that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people use legalization
or normalization, but liberalization is
[SPEAKER_01]: yet a different way to put it,
which is not the other two, which I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think the other two really fit or what
we're experiencing yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'll use that myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you reach out to these people
because they were showing symptoms and you
[SPEAKER_01]: reached out to them through healthcare
providers or did you just put a big call
[SPEAKER_01]: out to everybody and people who identified
with the nausea and the hot showers just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like self-identified?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, more the latter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was systematized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent this to various listservs related
to cannabis, to physicians who have an
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also reached out to emergency
departments and gastroenterologists and we
[SPEAKER_00]: contacted people who had previously been
authors of studies of CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was put on social media
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were a variety of methods of
outreach, but people could only come to it
[SPEAKER_00]: if they self-identified as being
interested in the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, I want to go into the THC
survey aspect and the genetics aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the same set so that we can talk about
all of that at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is neurologist and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the years, Shaping Fire has been
invited to sponsor several cannabis cups
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've said no to them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't until the AutoFlower Cup that I
really wanted to help promote something
[SPEAKER_01]: and the producers, Sebastian and Carla,
didn't even invite me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I approached them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told them that AutoFlower Cup was
important to me for three reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, it was obvious that they were going
for a friends and family vibe instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of commodified cannabis vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This event was going to gather really cool
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, the event had a ton of cool stuff
to do and to learn and to participate in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The event isn't just about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about living life fully, enjoying
community, eating together, laughing and
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to music and mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third, and most important to me
personally, the event was authentically
[SPEAKER_01]: for the AutoFlower community and the
AutoFlower community needs a place too.
[SPEAKER_01]: AutoFlower is about getting high,
sure, but I find that much of the
[SPEAKER_01]: AutoFlower community is still focused on
cannabis patients, home-grow, sharing best
[SPEAKER_01]: practices, sharing seeds and humility.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the ideals that I share with the
event and I wanted to make sure I did my
[SPEAKER_01]: part to help it succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Announcing the 2021 AutoFlower Cup August
6th, 7th and 8th in Lillawoop,
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, just outside of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: This over 21 event is presented by Camp
Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The AutoFlower competition is open to
everyone, commercial and home-growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: so get your skills recognized and enter
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cup win now will make you a leader in
the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here comes the ear candy, Stunden Glass
Hookah Lounge, Pop-Up Magical Butter
[SPEAKER_01]: Chocolate Shop, Waterfront Marketplace
with an array of vendors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be an old school AutoFlower
seed swap, joint rolling competition,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cooking demos, solventless
squishing demos and late night documentary
[SPEAKER_01]: screenings of Fantastic Fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chef Sebastian Carossi's award winning
classics like Elk Chili, Kobe Beef Kimchi
[SPEAKER_01]: Dogs, Oyster Po Boys and Razor Clam
Chowder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wild oyster harvesting, mushroom foraging,
s'mores around the campfires each night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan Jimmy of Mandalorian Presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin mushrooms presentations,
camping, glamping, RVs and Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check out CampRuderalis.com for those
details and follow the Instagram at the
[SPEAKER_01]: AutoFlowerCup 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the topics I want to share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: shaping fire episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shaping fire Instagram has follow up
posts to shaping fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials and of course, gorgeous
[SPEAKER_01]: flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shango Los Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_01]: my successes and failures in my own
garden, insights and best practices from
[SPEAKER_01]: personal grows everywhere and always
gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab or for your own
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you to follow at shaping
fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_01]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the national hemp program influx due
to stringent THC testing requirements,
[SPEAKER_01]: brother Seth and Eric Crawford continue to
release seeds to hemp farmers that will be
[SPEAKER_01]: legal, no matter how you grow them or when
you test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These new varieties from Oregon CBD seeds
have substantial amounts of CBDV,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBGV, CBCV and THCV while always staying
below the 0.3% THC limit and guaranteeing
[SPEAKER_01]: complying crops for farmers every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, these new varieties cannot be
pollinated by your neighbor's uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen or a rogue male in your own crop
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD seeds are non-GMO certified
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD seeds was founded and funded in
2015 by Seth and Eric maxing out their
[SPEAKER_01]: personal credit cards without outside
investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They continue to refuse outside investment
that would change their company culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD grows tons of fresh food on
their research farms for local food banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally tons of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also give away tens of thousands of
pounds of R&D flour to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: As their company began to succeed,
Seth and Eric started donating money to
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause
too by giving millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon State University in order to
establish the world's leading cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics research program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they treat their employees right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD pays for full health and dental
coverage for their employees, a 401k
[SPEAKER_01]: program and their minimum starting wage is
20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus everyone shares food from the farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth has been on shaping fire a few times
to talk about novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check out episodes 25 and 37 on
CBD cultivars in the hemp market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 66 on triploid cannabis genetics
and the very first shaping fire live
[SPEAKER_01]: episode 47 with Seth and soil expert,
Jeff Lowenfels talking about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a hemp farmer and you want to
grow reliable seeds that are sure to
[SPEAKER_01]: thrive in past testing, check out

[SPEAKER_01]: buying seeds for the 2021 season.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's oregoncbdseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shangalos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is neurologist and
cannabis researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dive into the first half of this
paper, which is about the survey about
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to cannabis users about their
usage of cannabis generally, but more
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically, you're trying to tease out
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you go about asking the questions,
Ethan?
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you trying to pull out of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And after they answered, what did you see
in the results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was a large series of questions
as you've seen and will be evident in the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper because we include links to the
entire survey, both the CHS patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went through simply saying,
have you used cannabis in the last year?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much a day?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type?
[SPEAKER_00]: By what method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Et cetera, et cetera, until we got the
answers we wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we started out with 585 respondents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of that, there were 205 patients who had
the constellation of symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome and
carried a diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were being very careful about who we
selected for the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed medical confirmation plus
ongoing symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you get from 585 to 205.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of that group, most were very high
frequency users of cannabis, 91% used
[SPEAKER_00]: daily or multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we mentioned, it was a high amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis flower concentrates, the median
response was four grams a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of THC predominant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other features of the CHS patients,
15.6% carried a diagnosis of either
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis dependency or addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's much higher than you'd expect in
other populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to corroborate that, almost 57% had
experienced withdrawal symptoms from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, which was also uncaring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on the good side, when people
stopped, like they might have gone in the
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency room and told they had to stop
using cannabis, 87.7% improved after they
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: But almost all suffered a recurrence when
they resumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a big problem in this study was
finding out who do we compare these people
[SPEAKER_00]: to?
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't just use normal people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who didn't use cannabis because we
wouldn't know if they had a susceptibility
[SPEAKER_00]: to developing cannabis hyperemesis
syndrome if they hadn't used it in similar
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found controls, so called,
who were high volume users of cannabis but
[SPEAKER_00]: did not have CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up with 54 of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the survey information,
all of them had used within a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% were daily or more than daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, mostly by smoking THC
predominant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in contrast to the CHS patients,
only 3.7% had been labeled as cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: addicted or dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vast majority, 76%, had never had
withdrawal symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 11% had been told that they needed to
stop cannabis for health reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we felt that this is a good comparison
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these two pools, the 205 patients
with CHS that was confirmed, they had all
[SPEAKER_00]: the symptoms, they had ongoing symptoms,
they had a diagnosis from a physician,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 54 controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these people were offered the
option of having their genomes tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is done by a swab in the mouth and
through the technology, that sample is
[SPEAKER_00]: amplified so that we can look at all the
base pairs of the genetic sequence and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if there are any unusual patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that really whittled things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although 99 patients from the CHS group
agreed to get a test kit, only 28%
[SPEAKER_00]: returned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems especially low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, especially after they said
they were willing to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we actually had a little bit of
pushback from the CHS community.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were people that questioned our
motives.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some people that said you
shouldn't do this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of recruitment to get our sample which
ended up being 28 CHS patients and 12
[SPEAKER_00]: controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were people pushing back because it was
being sponsored by a private company
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of an academic institution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it could have been a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's make something clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how to say this except
telling the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to sound accusatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people with CHS tend to be very
suspicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people who have it don't believe
that it's related to their cannabis usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, after all, everyone knows that
cannabis is supposed to be good for nausea
[SPEAKER_00]: and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how could it be creating this problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in fact, THC is an antiemetic,
something that helps prevent vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also subject to what's called a
biphasic dose response.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is at low doses THC will
prevent nausea and vomiting to some
[SPEAKER_00]: degree, hopefully a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at high doses it flips its activity
and can be proimetic, meaning making
[SPEAKER_00]: vomiting more likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus there are other considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: When someone uses cannabis to this extent,
they have tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of tolerance is that the CB1
receptors in the brain where THC works
[SPEAKER_00]: down regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sort of fold in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the brain's way of saying too much
activity here, we've got to turn down the
[SPEAKER_00]: volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are all these things that may be
coming into play, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism, the breakdown of THC that we
had to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we discuss the results, this will
become more clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you sent out these 99 kits and ended up
buying about 25% of people responded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see enough in the data where you
were able to get what you wanted even
[SPEAKER_01]: though you got less participation?
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the proof of something medical is
in the statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we want to see to make something
statistically significant is what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: a p-value, probability value of 5% or
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is that the results that
are seen could only happen by chance one
[SPEAKER_00]: in 20 times or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we achieve that with several
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it would have been better to
have more patients, but that again proved
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just the pushback from the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people who don't want
their chromosomes tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've heard of situations of people
getting arrested not because they had
[SPEAKER_00]: their genetic profile done, but their
cousin did, and somehow law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: found their way to the person in question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been some high profile cases
solved recently related to this
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as a patient having hyper emesis
syndrome, it seems like we're after
[SPEAKER_01]: reading paper, we're talking about two
things that have to both happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, the cannabis user needs to
have a high overall use of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: which appears to be predominant daily and
that they're using more than four grams of
[SPEAKER_01]: high THC material a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, while that's a big swing
between four grams of flour versus four
[SPEAKER_01]: grams of oil, one way or another,
you're at a high level as far as the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall users in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four grams of flour a day, while not
necessarily incredibly high for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people I know, if we take the pool of all
cannabis users, it's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptionally high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would emphasize that lower levels of
use could also lead to problems in someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this will vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let's get to that susceptibility
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first part is more or less you take
in a lot of THC, but that has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: coordinated with someone's genetic
predisposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this part of the paper unraveling
the genetic makeup, I can admit to the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that it's a bit over my head,
but luckily you break it down to there's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much five places that popped up for
you that showed some correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you go through, as you see fit,
the five sites and what you learned from
[SPEAKER_01]: those sites?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be happy to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's start off with one that we
suspected that didn't turn out to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern, at least in the patients that we
examined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be a gene called CNR1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the gene that encodes the CB1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CB1 is where THC works and the
endogenous cannabinoids work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been examined before.
[SPEAKER_00]: In relation to other disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're looking for is often what
are called single nucleotide
[SPEAKER_00]: polymorphisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way of saying that there is a
change in one pair of these base pairs in
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been some correlation of
mutations on CNR1, the CB1 receptor gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: related to cannabis usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't see that pattern in the
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a disorder that's sometimes
confused with CHS called CVS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cyclic vomiting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is actually different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often something that appears in
childhood, but may persist into adulthood
[SPEAKER_00]: and people have episodes of vomiting that
come out of the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be related to a propensity for
migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it starts off with a child
who has episodic vomiting without a
[SPEAKER_00]: headache and it's only when they're older
that they get the headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now CVS, cyclic vomiting syndrome,
has become more confused with CHS because
[SPEAKER_00]: in CVS people use cannabis to advantage to
treat the nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in cyclic vomiting syndrome,
there have been mutations in the CNR1 gene
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another point of distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to start there where we
expected a finding, but it wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it still is useful because we can
differentiate this from cyclic vomiting
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates a nice point of contrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what this did we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we'll start off with a gene called
COMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is short for mouthful,
catecholomethyltransferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: COMT is the gene that codes for an enzyme
that breaks down catecholamines,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially dopamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are neurotransmitters in the
brain and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we saw was a mutation in the COMT
and this occurred in 57.1 of the CHS
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, but only 10% of controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that had what's called a p-value of
0.012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's well below the 0.05 threshold
that makes something statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant from a medical standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had what's called an odds ratio of
12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is quite wide as compared to the
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we know about this mutation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well when COMT has a loss of function,
you have too much dopamine and an excess
[SPEAKER_00]: of that is associated with a number of
different problems like compulsive
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be anything from substance
abuse, gambling, even sex addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have been related to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This specific mutation that we saw is
called RS-464-6316.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, let me do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: RS-464-6316.
[SPEAKER_00]: In prior studies, this has been related to
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's called rumination behavior where
people can't get something out of their
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ruminate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also heavy alcohol intake at a younger
age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a feature in our survey that
we saw in CHS patients that a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: had problems with alcohol at one point in
their life or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other mutations on this gene have been
associated with impulsive behavior,
[SPEAKER_00]: disinhibited behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also some associations with attention
deficit, obsessive compulsive disorder,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm afraid a tendency towards anxiety
and even psychosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't mean that somebody who has
CHS has all these things, but we have seen
[SPEAKER_00]: similar problems in this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that they're more likely to have
these kinds of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly this finding provides some
insight into some of the things,
[SPEAKER_00]: the epiphenomena, the features that we see
in CHS patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that complete on the COMT?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to move on to the next one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the next one is one that I
predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the features of CHS is one of the
things that seems to help, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, use of capsaicin ointment on the
skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capsaicin is the caustic part of chili
peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some time ago, it was noticed that when
people had application of an ointment with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of capsaicin in it, that it would
reduce the nausea and vomiting at least
[SPEAKER_00]: temporarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the hot showers and the capsaicin
have in common is that they're working
[SPEAKER_00]: through another receptor called the TRIPV1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw a mutation there, and that was
something we predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 71.5% of the CHS patients had this,
and only 30% in controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a p-value of 0.015 below the
0.05 threshold, and an odds ratio of 5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gene has been linked to anxiety
and pain responses in the brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's also has activity on areas of the
brain that relate to how fast or slow your
[SPEAKER_00]: gut is moving, on how much fluid is
secreted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a definite tie-in to nausea
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as far as we know so far,
the TRIPV1 mutations haven't been observed
[SPEAKER_00]: previously when we've looked at patients
with cannabis dependency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, our finding on this specific mutation
may be a new one, because it wasn't in the
[SPEAKER_00]: usual databases of genetic changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is called RS18.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, the findings that we got
suggest a linkage of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperemesis syndrome to mood and gut
disturbances, as well as, obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hot water bathing behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, again, goes along with the success
of using capsaicin on the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That TRIPV1 receptor is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is capsaicin a common input into topical
lotions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't personally come across it
before, though it could be very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I heard that people were using that,
and they're like, oh, this works for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I would never have even tried
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's funny, because it
burns when you put it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like chili peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should point out, though, that
absorption of capsaicin orally is not very
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people have used, have eaten
Thai food that was too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it'll burn on the way in and on
the way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not getting into the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does get in the bloodstream through
the skin, as opposed to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that you can get blood levels
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else that you want to
mention on this particular site?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that's good for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually saw mutations in another area
of the same gene, but it didn't quite
[SPEAKER_00]: reach statistical significance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the kind of thing where,
you know, you highlighted it, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: worthwhile to look later on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to tell us a little bit about
it, even though for this study it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: statistically significant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's something we're going to
keep in the back of our minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get more people tested, maybe it
will achieve statistical significance at
[SPEAKER_00]: some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, if a person ends up having
a mutation on two areas of the same gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: it increases the likelihood that it isn't
going to work properly and that there'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be attendant problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, disease manifestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is this other site?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's just a different area of the same
gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just saw the correlation number was
high, but you didn't take it that next
[SPEAKER_01]: level to figure out what it might be doing
there yet, because the numbers were too
[SPEAKER_01]: low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something to keep an eye on in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then what's our next site?
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one also makes some good sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the CYP2C9 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a gene that's in the cytochrome
P450 series.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are enzymes that break down drugs
and toxins in the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it turns out, CYP2C9 is the breakdown
enzyme for THC and its first metabolite,
[SPEAKER_00]: 11-hydroxy-THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a problem with this gene,
it may mean that THC doesn't get broken
[SPEAKER_00]: down as readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw a mutation in the CHS patients
in 46.4% and only 10% of controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the p-value wasn't quite as dramatic,
but it was still 0.043, which is below
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if we think about this
conceptually, if this enzyme is not as
[SPEAKER_00]: functional as it should be, it could lead
to accumulation of THC and get into that
[SPEAKER_00]: biphasic dose response where THC,
instead of becoming anti-emetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes pro-emetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's even possible, because the enzyme
isn't quite right, that it is making a
[SPEAKER_00]: different metabolite than usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of 11-hydroxy-THC, it's possible,
probably unlikely, but it's possible that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's making a different product that could
have toxic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to help us out here, just a couple of
months ago, there was a new study where a
[SPEAKER_00]: single patient got tested and they had two
sites on CYP2C19 that were odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a CHS patient who was
cannabis-dependent and they said had a
[SPEAKER_00]: personality disorder as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't provide a lot of detail on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that's been seen at
least one other time, but our study was
[SPEAKER_00]: the first to look at it systematically.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that this CYP2C19 is where THC
gets broken down, am I thinking about this
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to think of it as, okay,
normally when we use THC, it is cleared
[SPEAKER_01]: from our body in three to four hours,
or at least from the usable flow in three
[SPEAKER_01]: to four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this site not working effectively,
it would just simply either A,
[SPEAKER_01]: break down THC in longer than three or
four hours, so there's almost like a
[SPEAKER_01]: half-life because you'd already be smoking
your next smoke before all your prior THC
[SPEAKER_01]: is processed, or maybe it's and or,
the THC is being broken down incorrectly,
[SPEAKER_01]: not towards body best practices,
if you will, and so it's actually kicking
[SPEAKER_01]: out chemicals that are not what you would
expect when you smoke THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had said CYP2C19.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually CYP2C9, but I'm glad you
mentioned that because CYP2C19 also breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: down THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not the predominant enzyme that
does, and we did see changes there in a
[SPEAKER_00]: few patients, but again, not with
statistical significance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so by my count, we have hit either
three or four sites, so we've either got
[SPEAKER_01]: one or two left.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's our next one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've done three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've talked about four,
but three that were statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next one relates to the first
one, and that is, this is DRD2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the gene that codes for the D2
dopamine receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, dopamine is a chemical messenger
neurotransmitter in the brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and DRD2 is the target of most
anti-psychotic drugs, drugs used to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenia, and when there's a drug
that stimulates this receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: it actually causes vomiting and affects
the gut motility, how fast the gut is
[SPEAKER_00]: moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw a mutation in DRD2 in 60.7 of
the CYP2C9 CHS patients, and only 20% of
[SPEAKER_00]: controls, so the p-value on that was .031,
well below .05.
[SPEAKER_00]: This same mutation, which is on a thing
called RS4648318, in prior studies is
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly associated with depression and
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are features we see a lot in CHS
patients, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there have been associations of
other mutations on this gene with nicotine
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction, Tourette syndrome, and chronic
pain, and those are all, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction and chronic pain were features
that we saw in a number of the
[SPEAKER_00]: respondents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I should point out that we have a
mutation on DRD2, also on COMT,
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene that breaks down dopamine,
so we've got sort of a double whammy here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak, affecting dopamine
metabolism, and this may really help
[SPEAKER_00]: explain how cannabinoid hyperemesis
syndrome is associated with nausea and
[SPEAKER_00]: vomiting and some of these psychiatric
problems that seem to appear in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so it's interesting to see that
this is the second site that we've talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about that's directly related to the
dopamine system, and so no doubt that's
[SPEAKER_01]: playing a significant role in the
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it also points out something
else we know phenomenologically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is that the drug haloperidol,
which is normally used to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenia, is more effective in
treating the nausea and vomiting in CHS
[SPEAKER_00]: patients than the more commonly used
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: More commonly used are things like
Ondansetron and Grenicetron that work
[SPEAKER_00]: through a different receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work very poorly in CHS patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the problem is that haloperidol is a
drug you don't want to be taking all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely sedating, can be associated
with massive weight gain, and some really
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible long-term side effects,
possibility of developing diabetes,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a movement disorder from the drug
called tardive dyskinesia, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely difficult to treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, taking haloperidol on a regular basis
isn't something that people are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to look at better approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I've got two quick comments on
vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, you know, I don't know much
about the drug Dansetron, but I love the
[SPEAKER_01]: name Dansetron.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a video game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Ondansetron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's still pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a playful ring to it still,
but more importantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for a moment ago,
I was searching for the word syndrome,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I kept on wanting to come up
with disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: When used, you know, as a medical term,
what does this word syndrome mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a syndrome is a pattern of problems
that leads to a diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A disease is due to one cause,
whereas a syndrome may have multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: different causes.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, actually, we'll use a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about Parkinson disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's more than one cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be called Parkinson syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you lose a certain number of
neurons related to the dopamine system
[SPEAKER_00]: again in the brain, that can come from any
cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aging, strokes, toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have killed off 90% of those
cells, you have a Parkinson syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a disease would be more like strep
throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: A disorder caused by streptococcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, unfortunately, these terms are used
somewhat interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a syndrome is a pattern of symptoms or
signs that leads to a diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what's the fifth and final site we're
going to talk about here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this one is a little harder to
explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on something called ABCA1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the ATP binding cassette
transporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gene affects cholesterol and other
lipid metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's most important in that it's related
to Alzheimer disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that disorder, there's an
accumulation of abnormal proteins in the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get to how that relates here if
we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we saw a mutation in ABCA1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was present in 67.9% of the
cannabinoid hyperemesis patients and only
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% of controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that was a p-value of .012,
well below the .05 threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, additionally, this is a homozyme
ligus mutation, meaning that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have two sets of each chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appeared in both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just on one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, unfortunately, because this gene
mutation appeared in both chromosomes in
[SPEAKER_00]: affected patients, it could imply an
increased risk of the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: dementia, memory loss later in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And additionally, it could lead to risk
factors for coronary artery disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: heart attacks, and the development of type
2 diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not this specific mutation,
but another mutation on a closely related
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, ABCB1, were associated with cannabis
dependency in another study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, but we certainly see a
higher degree of cannabis dependency in
[SPEAKER_00]: the CHS patients than we could explain by
chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when you got the results and you saw
these five sites, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was the other one that
didn't have quite enough significant
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was your initial response like,
hot damn, there's five sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have something here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or were you like, oh, we were really
hoping for 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like anything more than one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as somebody who is, you know,
I don't do your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know whether or not getting
five hits like this is like wildly
[SPEAKER_01]: successful or regular or low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we really have something here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several genes that help explain
the phenomenology of CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I should emphasize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that any of the patients had
all five mutations, but often they'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of one or several.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're looking at again is a
susceptibility factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope that we can use this as a
screening device.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it is now, someone who has this
constellation of symptoms ends up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of hospitalizations and emergency
department visits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is very invasive and expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been two quotes in the
literature of how much people have spent
[SPEAKER_00]: before they've gotten a diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's ranged between $26,000 and
$96,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in the $96,000 was some years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee those costs would be higher
now if this is not recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's our hope that in the future,
if a patient comes to the ER and the
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor there is wondering about this,
they may want to do this test and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a susceptibility there,
especially if they've previously had
[SPEAKER_00]: tests, CAT scans, MRIs, upper GI,
lower GI.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tests are almost always negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping that this is going to lead to
better identification and saving people
[SPEAKER_00]: time and money as well as pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I move us off the sites,
do you have anything that you want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: on any of these sites before I move to the
next set?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far during this set, we have talked
about the two primary folks who are in
[SPEAKER_01]: this dance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first being high THC and then second
being showing mutations on these sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as somebody who's been in the scene
for a long time and have had friends who
[SPEAKER_01]: have experienced these symptoms,
and I've seen them firsthand, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of us who have participated in really
ugly threads on social media about what
[SPEAKER_01]: was causing these symptoms and then
eventually being called CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of those are neem, which is a crushed
up seed used as a fertilizer and to some a
[SPEAKER_01]: pest discouragement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other people were making
suggestions that it's clearly Eagle 20,
[SPEAKER_01]: a classically banned cannabis pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the defense of it being one or two or
both of these were just like off the
[SPEAKER_01]: charts to see people get so angry with
each other about bro science is really
[SPEAKER_01]: disheartening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to address these,
Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can you tell us about neem and
what can you tell us about pesticides as
[SPEAKER_01]: they're ability to be causes for CHS?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been a great critic of pesticide
use in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've published about this before,
and it would have been nice if that were
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: As someone who had the misfortune of
treating patients with pesticide exposure,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that it's a totally
different situation to CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as someone who uses organic neem on my
fruit and berries, it doesn't fit either.
[SPEAKER_00]: The symptoms do not match up at all,
and they certainly are not producing
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic mutations at this level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the case that some pesticides could
mess with a person's DNA, but I'm afraid
[SPEAKER_00]: that that is just delusional to think that
that's the cause of the syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of other examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this syndrome, CHS, was first
described in 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, it was not the degree of
pesticide usage in cannabis culture that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, CHS has been encountered,
unfortunately, with synthetic cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, where although they certainly can
be toxic, there's no reason to think that
[SPEAKER_00]: there would be pesticides or neem in
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one of those theories that
doesn't hold water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ethan, the assertion that you made
that there were less pesticides being used
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2004 than there are now, that jumps up
to me like a red flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm curious if you would break that
thought out to me, because as far as most
[SPEAKER_01]: of us chat, most of us say back in the
day, people would put any kind of evil
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide on their stuff so that they
could get it out through the black market,
[SPEAKER_01]: and people didn't know their customer as
often because they were shipping it places
[SPEAKER_01]: or they were putting it downstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas nowadays, people are more aware of
the pesticides being unhealthy and more
[SPEAKER_01]: people are looking for pesticide-free
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my assumption, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in your head that gives you the
idea that they were used more in 2004?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's based on what I've heard from
testing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, the sophistication in
identifying these compounds is greater
[SPEAKER_00]: than it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this is a phenomenon that's
gone through peaks and valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't give you the statistics in
any given year, but suffice it to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and neem are not the cause of
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That part I get well.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's wrap up this set.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we come back to set three,
we're going to talk about a handful of
[SPEAKER_01]: questions that don't have easy categories,
but for now, let's go ahead and take our
[SPEAKER_01]: break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is neurologist and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I love growing under the sun,
there's a lot of good reasons to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're like most folks,
you want a lighting source that grows
[SPEAKER_01]: high-yielding, healthy plants without
using excessive amounts of electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: BIOS lighting creates biological lighting
solutions that brings the natural
[SPEAKER_01]: brilliance of the outdoors into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: BIOS lighting has the attributes that I
look for in a horticultural lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've bought those cheap lights online,
and they're difficult to work with and
[SPEAKER_01]: fail in no time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In contrast, my BIOS LED light is
industrial-grade to last a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is IP 66 wet-rated, so little foliar
overspray won't harm it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is easy to clean without taking it
down, and of course, the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect, it is built for the exact light
spectrum I want for great-yielding,
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't hurt that their lighting
rigs look badass, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many horticultural LED lighting systems
are based on irrelevant performance
[SPEAKER_01]: metrics, and people love to argue online
about these numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to judge on PAR photon efficiency
and how happy my plants are, and the BIOS
[SPEAKER_01]: lights exceed my expectations in these
categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: BIOS lights have an optimized broad
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growth, while also providing the
ideal conditions for superior PAR efficacy
[SPEAKER_01]: and a comfortable visual experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also love their attentive and
over-educated customer service folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: BIOS starts with a team of biologists
before getting the electrical engineers
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have studied how light impacts
cannabis plants and devised an overall
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you to check out their website
at bioslighting.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_01]: how this strategy can work for you.

[SPEAKER_01]: After you've caught up on the latest
Shaping Fire episodes, do you sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: wish there was more cannabis education
available to learn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire has a fabulous YouTube
channel with content on polyculture
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis growing, Dr. Sunil Agrawal on the
history of cannabis medicine around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, Eric Vlosky and Josh Rutherford on
solvent-less extraction, and Jeff
[SPEAKER_01]: Lowenfels on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: While there, be sure to check out the
three 10-part Shaping Fire session series,
[SPEAKER_01]: one with Kevin Jodry, one with Dr. Ethan
Russo, and one with Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even my own presentations on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business, even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: As of today, there's over 200 videos that
you can check out for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to youtube.com forward slash shango
los or click on the link in the
[SPEAKER_01]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: as cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_01]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plant industry, and today many
cannabis cultivators are moving from
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays and chemicals to beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copert Biological Systems has the
beneficial insects, mites and nematodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: microbials, sticky cards, and air
distribution units you need to partner

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is neurologist and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ethan, you know, one of the things
that the paper points out that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I really identified with was the
paper said that in general, people waited
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time to get help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I'm certainly the kind of man
who's willing to ask for directions when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm driving my car and I'm not afraid to
go to the doctor's, it all just sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: To have to go, but at the same time,
these symptoms are severe, and the sooner
[SPEAKER_01]: you go, the better, you know, your
likelihood for treatment is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, can you kind of talk to both the
psychological aspect of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people resisting going to a doctor about
something, but also more specifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you saw as the line in the sand for
these patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: of when they had had enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it often has required the
intervention of a family member or friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some of these patients, they'll spend
all day in the shower as long as the hot
[SPEAKER_00]: water lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really can come down to that,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, there's the factor that some of them
have already been told that this is likely
[SPEAKER_00]: related to cannabis usage and it's not a
message that's well received.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the whole factor of
legality or illegality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we on the West Coast are more
accustomed to cannabis being legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not true everywhere at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still a stigma attached,
no matter how you look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I buy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for most of us who use cannabis,
you know, even though I consider it all
[SPEAKER_01]: medical, most people think about it either
medical or recreational, but the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: care system is not necessarily our friend
either of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one wants to go to the hospital to
be, you know, treated like an addict or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's talk about the treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the paper makes it sound
very cut and dry that the only treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: apparently is stopping using cannabis for
a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it that cut and dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is if we're talking about
eliminating the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that doesn't preclude the idea that
we may develop approaches that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce or mitigate symptoms,
but we don't have anything like that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't cover your body in capsaicin
cream as a regular treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, at this point, we have
signals from our results, places to point
[SPEAKER_00]: for possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we know that haloperidol works
better than other antiemetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another drug, aprepetin has been
used in one patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works on a different area in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things to wonder
about is could the problem be attacked by
[SPEAKER_00]: something from cannabis other than THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, for example, whenever you take your
THC, make sure you take some CBN with it
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm afraid that isn't going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seemingly, any exposure to THC is a risk
factor for someone who has CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there may be a certain threshold
and we find people are trying to skirt
[SPEAKER_00]: that threshold all the time, but when an
attack hits, it's too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, there's an extremely high
relapse rate with this syndrome once it's
[SPEAKER_00]: established and we have to recommend or
someone in my position as a physician has
[SPEAKER_00]: to recommend abstinence from THC exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it more like a tolerance break or,
I mean, like, is it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should stop using THC forever ever or
is it... At all.
[SPEAKER_01]: At all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like, oh, you're a daily
dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to go down to joints only,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I wouldn't rule out the possibility
that there is a low level threshold,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people are not going to be able to
resume their prior intake levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and this is very individualized
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So none of these are generalities,
really, depending on the susceptibility of
[SPEAKER_01]: each person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use the term attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said when they have an attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had not really considered it as an
attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do they come on like an episode where
you're not feeling it?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you describe an episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, I could start with this
prodrome of nausea and vomiting or low
[SPEAKER_00]: level nausea and then progress to a full
blown episode with nausea, vomiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: abdominal pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the course of a day or is this like
over the course of a week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it can vary, but often there may be
weeks or even months of the prodrome
[SPEAKER_00]: before full blown attacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got, you know, the possibility
that changes in usage could be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a possibility that, you know,
some of this pharmaceuticals might be
[SPEAKER_01]: useful, but really the long and the short
of it is once you're diagnosed with CHS,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is actually called for is cessation
of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, there may be other adjunctive
approaches that are helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to look at whether lifestyle
factors enter in, you know, whether
[SPEAKER_00]: they're dietary changes that could be
helpful, anti-inflammatory diets,
[SPEAKER_00]: more healthy diets, fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unclear at this point, but that
would be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could aerobic activity or meditation or
any of these other things be helpful?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're at a stage where these are
avenues that need to be explored,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wouldn't have any hard and fast
suggestions aside from THC avoidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The study mentions a couple of times
particular patients that exhibited
[SPEAKER_01]: withdrawal symptoms and most folks don't
consider cannabis additives, therefore
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not really going to have withdrawal
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that like for a patient
who is using THC for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction of suffering, you know,
the lack of that, you know, causes pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's not really withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are these withdrawal symptoms that
some of the patients exhibited?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it isn't pink elephants,
you know, associated with alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, when people have withdrawal
symptoms from cannabis usage, it's usually
[SPEAKER_00]: some combination of mild symptoms,
anxiety, insomnia, nervousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually relatively short-lived,
but the fact that people had been labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: as cannabis addicted or admitted to
withdrawal symptoms to a higher degree in
[SPEAKER_00]: our population is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess one might expect it from the
high levels of use, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the controls had similar usage rates
without the same levels of addiction or
[SPEAKER_00]: withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's clearly a difference here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both this study and an earlier study that
is quoted within your survey lists
[SPEAKER_01]: differences between the genders,
both in participation and in people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are experiencing CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we seeing any, I don't know what you'd
call it, but gender predilection for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, men or women to be more likely
to get this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's always an interesting issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clear from prior studies that there
seemed to be a male predominance in CHS,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not what we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, first, let's look at what happened
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is clearly the case that more men are
going to be high-volume users of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe less and less the case,
again, given current demographic trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our survey, we had a female
predominance in both men and women,
[SPEAKER_00]: both the CHS patients and the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that could be due to the willingness
of women to participate in the study,
[SPEAKER_00]: so heard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it's clear that a person
of either gender could be susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: development of CHS if they have genetic
predilection towards it and high rates of
[SPEAKER_00]: use of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's interesting, too, that the older
study showed more males and this newer
[SPEAKER_01]: study shows more females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the sample size is, you know,
pretty small in both studies, do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, you know, more likely just the
randomness of who signed up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It always could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's certainly possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, before this survey came out,
a lot of people who believed they had CHS
[SPEAKER_01]: were trying to help themselves by using
CBD, increasing their cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any suggestion that cannabidiol
because of its general ability to modulate
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is going to be any use for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is it's not clear cut from the
information that we have at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the problem, of course,
is that it's hard to get material that is
[SPEAKER_00]: solely CBD with no THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labeling isn't always going to give you
the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either, you know, we see a fair amount of
THC contamination, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: of supposed CBD material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is possible that a pure CBD
preparation might offer some protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's conjectural at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also may not be what people really
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning it won't get them the results that
they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, why are people using this much
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be because there are two reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, they enjoy it and or it's
treating something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using it to treat something,
some symptom that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could CBD replace that?
[SPEAKER_00]: One hopes, but I wouldn't say there's any
guarantee at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there could be other cannabis
components that are going to be proved to
[SPEAKER_00]: be useful or adjunctive treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that's conjectural at this
point and something we'd like to explore
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: The five sites that we looked at earlier,
are we aware of other actions that happen
[SPEAKER_01]: on those sites that could suggest that
there is a different cause to this than
[SPEAKER_01]: THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is the correlation so high that other
suspects are less likely?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the latter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, THC is the scenic one known.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there isn't THC aboard, you don't see
CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: That part's clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there might be other things involved,
but THC without it, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's this expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no never and no always in
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is one of those situations where
it appears that THC is always associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that wraps us up for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan, thank you so much for sharing this
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, CHS or this host of symptoms has
been a boogeyman in our community for so
[SPEAKER_01]: long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I remember being down at
Emerald Cup, I don't know, probably three
[SPEAKER_01]: or four years ago, and we all shared a
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember one of the friends who was
staying with us lost her whole weekend
[SPEAKER_01]: because she, you know, had an attack,
an episode, and she spent the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend in the hot bath and a hot shower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that was my first time that
I had really come across it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seemed absolutely, you know,
terrible to go through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also she was there, you know,
as an employee before she was where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she wasn't able to do that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nice that there's finally,
you know, I believe this is, if not the
[SPEAKER_01]: first study to pull it all together,
at least the biggest study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to see this finally coming
together to put some light on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see research on this now
continuing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are there already second and third
wave studies that have seen what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are ready to jump on and take the
baton?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're not quite published yet,
so no.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study has been accepted for
publication in the journal called Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and Cannabinoid Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope that it will spur other efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly plan to remain involved in
studying this unusual condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's our hope this is going to
lead to better identification of CHS and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully better treatment in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're listening, we're not
going to publish this episode until the
[SPEAKER_01]: paper comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there will be a link to the paper
on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, in case the idea that Ethan
just said the paper's not out and yet you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to read it, you know, this episode
will not come out until it actually comes
[SPEAKER_01]: out into the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ethan, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate to have you here as always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for reaching out and offering us
your first interview on the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wish you much success in fleshing
this out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I welcome the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to find out more information
about this study or the folks that were
[SPEAKER_01]: involved with it, you can go a couple
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, you can go to Ethan
Russo's company, Credo Science,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is C-R-E-D-O.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also go to their partner for this
survey, which is endokanahealth.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's E-N-D-O-C-A-N-N-A health.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you listened to a couple episodes
ago with Dr. Chris Spooner, the naturopath
[SPEAKER_01]: who taught about individualized medicine,
he's over at Endokana Health as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is one of the coauthors with Ethan
on this survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, Ethan always shares
his email address in case you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to him directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's EthanRusso at Comcast.net.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do email Ethan, give him some
time to get back with you because he does
[SPEAKER_01]: try to get back with everybody,
but he's a busy person doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: traveling for research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, be kind and be patient.
