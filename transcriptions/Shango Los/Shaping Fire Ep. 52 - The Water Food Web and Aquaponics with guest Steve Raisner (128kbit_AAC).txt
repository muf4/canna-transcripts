[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the Shaping Fire show
pretty often, chances are that you're at
[SPEAKER_00]: least somewhat familiar with the soil-food
web.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the term now used pretty
universally to describe the transfer of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy between species in the ecosystem of
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about all the plants,
bacteria, fungi, microbes, protozoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes, and arthropods, and then birds
and other animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exist from the tiny guys deep in the
soil all the way up to where the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: stops and our feet start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of us who study and create living
soil have become pretty familiar with the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil-food web by learning from thought
leaders like Dr. Elaine Ingham and Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowenfels and other folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually one of my favorite things to
even think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine my astonishment when I learned
that there was another food web,
[SPEAKER_00]: mirroring the one that we have for soil,
but taking place in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in retrospect, that there would
be a water-food web is pretty obvious,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I had never given it much thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea that there was a twin to my
favorite topic of living soil made me
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water-food web consists of
phytoplankton, algae, zooplankton,
[SPEAKER_00]: small fish, crustaceans, and all the way
up to bigger fish and corals and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually whales.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water-food web describes how all of
these life forms exchange energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: compete and form a complex web similar in
many ways to the ones that we know for
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's totally badass.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, my guest is cannabis aquaponics
expert, Steve Reisner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve designs and builds commercial scale
aquaponics systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: He builds them for lots of different
purposes, but he especially enjoys
[SPEAKER_00]: building them for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve is a sought after speaker on the
range of cannabis growing topics and
[SPEAKER_00]: shares his knowledge via his Potent Ponics
podcast and in person through classes he
[SPEAKER_00]: hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also built a very educational YouTube
channel, also called Potent Ponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a range of content from instructional
videos to Google Hangouts with topic
[SPEAKER_00]: experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're gonna talk about the Water
Food Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so glad that you could peel off a
little of your time there in Oklahoma off
[SPEAKER_00]: your project to chat with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, aquaponics and the Water
Food Web, while it is the center of your
[SPEAKER_00]: world and certainly it's increasing in
popularity, I think that it's kind of on
[SPEAKER_00]: the fringe of most cannabis people's
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's start off by giving people a
context of what we're even gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about it at a global level,
if we were talking about the water food
[SPEAKER_00]: web, we would be talking about salt water
and fresh water and estuaries and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from phytoplankton all the way
up to whales and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today I'm figuring that it's probably
better for us to talk about the water food
[SPEAKER_00]: web as it applies to aquaponics,
your specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with this word aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The words aquaponics, hydroponics and
aquaculture are thrown around and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: incorrectly used synonymously back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you kind of like give us some depth
on how to use these words and what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually gonna be talking about today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, so I guess traditionally aquaculture
would be the growing and raising of fish
[SPEAKER_01]: for the mainly food purposes, but
sometimes other utility purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also use them for skin grafts and
even filtering wines and beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use fish bladders and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also use, so for hydroponics,
everyone's pretty familiar with
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics that listens to your show,
using mineralized salts in an aquatic
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and just delivering a non-soil
or soil-less environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditionally, most of the time,
but not all the time in hydroponics are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing so in a sterile or as sterile as
possible aquatic environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have aquaponics where we use
fish and fish waste similar from an
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaculture system to raise fish in a
hydroponic system, although they are
[SPEAKER_01]: different chemically than traditional
hydroponics in many different ways because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the mineralization process and how much
more we rely on a much wider range of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes than they would in a hydroponic
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes ones that can cause problems in
a hydroponic system actually are very
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial in an aquaponic system if
they're maintained in proper population
[SPEAKER_01]: levels in the right balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So saying that a different way,
hydroponics is gonna be more kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled, salt-based, A plus B kind of
stuff, which may not be organicky natural,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they get the job done feeding the
plants to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aquaponics is gonna be way more analog,
chunky, organic, natural, which is great
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plants but if you try to use those
solutions in hydroponics, all your
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayers would get clogged with nature,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like really fine sprayers,
fine water lines, all of them would have
[SPEAKER_01]: clogged with bacterial mats and other
issues that anyone that's run those even
[SPEAKER_01]: without biologics has run into those
issues as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from listening to you speak before,
I've heard you talk about the split biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably a really great place
for us to start because when I first
[SPEAKER_00]: started doing my research for this
interview today, I actually thought that
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics had the cannabis plant bare
root in, like in my head was essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: an aquarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like the roots dangling in
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all like, how do they breathe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when it comes to soil,
we don't wanna overwater because it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: choke out the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't know how these,
how these roots are gonna live in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I hear you say split biome and
I'm like, oh, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's both water and either a soil or maybe
an inert substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you describe that and kind of
explain the idea behind it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, so what you were first describing is
what is referred to as DWC or deep water
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, which is bare root in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of people that have done
tests in the past, different aquaponics
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it simply doesn't allow the proper
flower structure and proper plant
[SPEAKER_01]: structure and node density as well as a
few other issues with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use a method called dual root zone
planting where we have pots and where they
[SPEAKER_01]: have the top half is soil and a layer of
burlap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bottom half is either lava rack or
hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this allows us to have terrestrial
microbes, mycorrhizae, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: and different terrestrial microbes that
all of you guys are familiar with from
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure you've had other amazing
guests on talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the aquatic microbiome
where we have all these aquatic microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: that can mineralize all these different
nutrients in their own way, very similarly
[SPEAKER_01]: to the ones in soil, but they do so in
radically different ways chemically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this allows us to do is stimulate
the immune system of the plant in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that is radically broader than just a soil
or just an aquatic environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a study done by NASA a few years
ago where NASA was trying to do a broad
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial study of aquatic microbes and
terrestrial microbes so they could figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out, okay, well, if we go off world,
what microbe groups do we need to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: with us if we're gonna grow a garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we need to bottle and bring with
us to make food and crops and whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: else they need to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: What they found was when they did the
commercial aquaponics facilities around
[SPEAKER_01]: North America, they did over 50 of them,
none of them had the same microbe webs
[SPEAKER_01]: across any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was no more than 7%
similarities across microbes, across all
[SPEAKER_01]: these different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that means is that you have radically
different microbe of species that are
[SPEAKER_01]: making iron available or silica available
or nitrogen available or potassium or
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, et cetera, and none of them
were the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of them had kind of different
processes for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just really cool that you have
such biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what that means is that we can get
increased terpene expression, increased
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid expression in our plants as
well as accelerated growth rate is what
[SPEAKER_01]: that translated into as far as bottom line
for the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there's a lot there to unpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I wanna unpack there is
where the path is for the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we've got the cannabis plant planted
in soil, and so we are getting a more
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional, what we think about as the
rhizosphere and living soil, and the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is growing down through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll get to the burlap a bit in
a minute and then rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to a certain degree, this sounds like
building a traditional pot with the
[SPEAKER_00]: different horizons like you'd get in the
earth's crust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at what point does the cannabis plant's
roots hit the water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the roots going down to the water
table so that the ends of the roots are
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting this specialty aquaponic water
with fish in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this just a regular pot that's being
watered from the top with water from an
[SPEAKER_00]: exterior tank?
[SPEAKER_01]: So after day three or four, once we
transplant them into that soil layer,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant finds that aquatic layer and
it'll have a noticeable increase in the
[SPEAKER_01]: speed of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants really seem to use the nitrates
better and much faster than the typical
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonia in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really helps with accelerated
growth as well as the additional air
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure because those roots are flood and
drain, they have much more air exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And between the air and the different form
of nitrogen, it really accelerates that
[SPEAKER_01]: growth rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they grow straight through that burlap
and into the water so that the plant has
[SPEAKER_01]: both a network in the soil and in the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was back working at the
aquaponic source a long time ago where I
[SPEAKER_01]: used to work in the lab, we did all kinds
of experiments and we found the woodier
[SPEAKER_01]: the crop in aquaponics, the more it relies
on mycorrhizal fungi and the more lignin
[SPEAKER_01]: it has, I guess, to boil it down as a
general rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, not definitive, but as a general
rule of thumb in aquaponics, you need a
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper soil layer for the woodier the
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I was doing fruit trees or something
I was going to do indefinitely,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe I would do more of a two-thirds soil
to one-third of flood and drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with cannabis plants, we're going
to do about a 50-50 instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should people resist the temptation to
have a drip irrigation with aquaponic
[SPEAKER_00]: water from the top because we want to
encourage the cannabis roots to explore
[SPEAKER_00]: the deeper aquaponic layer downwards
because we want to encourage them to
[SPEAKER_00]: expand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually top water all of our soil
layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our flood and drain layer actually leaves
about a half-inch of air before the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want it to touch or wick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we top water about twice a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, you could use an automated
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: For our larger systems, we use a
completely automated array.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually designed my own manifold
that allows us to water as many plants as
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to simultaneously within about 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a milliliters difference across all
the plants simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this way we don't have to worry about
overwatering and having that water go
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a dual root zone, we're going to
take their water and say it takes 16
[SPEAKER_01]: ounces of water to fully saturate that
upper soil layer, which we'll test before
[SPEAKER_01]: we put the pots in the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just say for the sake of argument,
we have an eight ounce party cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it takes two of those for me to
water for that water to drip through the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and go out through the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to reduce that amount by half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the future, if I need to top water,
I'm only going to dose with eight ounces
[SPEAKER_01]: of water so that I'm not dosing so much
that it's leaching out into the aquarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this allows me to maintain moisture
levels in that upper layer between the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity coming off the bottom of the bed
and then the top watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can maintain pleasant moisture levels
for the root system and do some minor
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fish waste provides around 85% to 90%
of the nutrients the plants need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just amend that last 10%
through the soil layer, either through
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals that we make in the initial soil
compost mix that we use for it or through
[SPEAKER_01]: top feeding, depending on what it is that
we need at a given time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are top watering, are you top
watering with water from the aquaponic
[SPEAKER_00]: system or are you using, I don't know,
terrestrial water, I guess I'll call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: regular water?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually use water from the
aquaponic system with one exception would
[SPEAKER_01]: be the second half of flower, but in veg
or certainly the first half of flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would absolutely use system water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of, in late flower,
you're really trying to cut back on the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want to put any more on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'd probably be the only time that
we don't use water from the system itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we're just recirculating water
from the system for our top feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just pump it into a separate
mineralization tank, some water from our
[SPEAKER_01]: mineralization tanks, which we can talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also amend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have the pH is too low,
we'll add potassium silicate or calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonate or whatever pH up that we're
going to use at the time and amend it that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before we add it back in, but this way
we can add some mineral rich nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: back into the system that all come from
the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my second question on that is,
I live on an island, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the challenges that we've got
is I live on an agricultural island and
[SPEAKER_00]: people are constantly saying, don't over
nitrogen your fields because when it runs
[SPEAKER_00]: off the island, it goes into the Puget
Sound and it causes too much algae and red
[SPEAKER_00]: tide and all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wondered to what degree do you have to,
for example, avoid using compost teas in
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants because as these nutrients go
through the plant, they end up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: aquarium, your aquaponic layer and might
throw off your balance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, are you only supposed to use the
aquaponic or clean non-treated water or
[SPEAKER_00]: can I go ahead and use compost teas?
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, we use teas and ferments as part
of our mineralization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also use ferments as a way to bio
control for pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually use lactobacillus ferments
labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've had many people on the
show talk about the wonders of labs,
[SPEAKER_01]: but one of the cool things of labs is in
an aquatic environment is it'll equalize
[SPEAKER_01]: some manila listeria and other things in a
controlled lab environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I can quote, I can't say it'll work
100% of the time on your farm legally,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know for a fact in a laboratory,
it works and it works very well in
[SPEAKER_01]: practicality as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can use these types of things not
only to keep your system clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to eliminate pathogens and still use
all those wonderful compost teas and
[SPEAKER_01]: ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a bit real huge on horsetail fern
ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also will use occasionally fruit juice
ferments as well and flour for top
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the stuff that you guys have used
already for your soil mixes absolutely can
[SPEAKER_01]: be used for aquaponics and many of them
actually have some radically additional
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one exception would be yucca extract
and any kind of wetting agents,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant-based wetting agents, saponins and
some other things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all fish lethal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's organic doesn't mean it
won't kill your fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because while it may not be an
organic toxin, it's going to throw off the
[SPEAKER_00]: balance enough that it's no longer a good
living environment for the fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, saponins are straight up fish
lethal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Indians in California used to,
or natives, I don't know, I guess that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the correct term now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The natives in California used to collect
yucca root extract, yucca root.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd squeeze the juice out of it,
concentrate it and evaporate it off,
[SPEAKER_01]: pour it into streams during the salmon run
and collect the salmon and then dry them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The saponin once it's cooked and
everything is perfectly fine for humans
[SPEAKER_01]: but it kills the fish in parts per billion
levels in a river.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's a mad science right there to
know that so early on without an analytics
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with no chemistry knowledge or an
idea of even what chemistry was to come up
[SPEAKER_01]: with that's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting sometimes to look
at some of the ancient solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the interesting stuff I've done
with amino acid isolation actually came
[SPEAKER_01]: from 16th and 17th century dye making
techniques that I adapted to make plant
[SPEAKER_01]: food and some other cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always really neat things
sometimes going back in history and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at how we used to do things is
sometimes even better than looking
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm hearing from you, I really
thought that it was kind of like a zero
[SPEAKER_00]: sum game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either did living soil growing or you
did aquaponics growing and it really
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like aquaponics is supercharged
living soil growing because you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your regular living soil stuff that
you would do to create this healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere in the upper layers but then
you're supercharging it with the water
[SPEAKER_00]: food web that we're gonna talk more about
in the second set as the roots reaches
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the aquaponic layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, yeah and again it gives you
benefits of both worlds and you absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: could do it just a soil anew in a wicking
bed but with this we get radically
[SPEAKER_01]: increased in speed of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get radical increase in speed of a
bunch of different mineralization methods
[SPEAKER_01]: and we get a radical increase in disease
resistance, a radical increase in terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: expression as well and you know all those
combined really makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on so let's go ahead and dive into
that during set two and wrap up this one
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna take our first short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is aquaponic cannabis expert
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Reisner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil and regenerative cannabis
agriculture are surging in popularity and
[SPEAKER_00]: to implement these biological solutions
real science education is vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in all things
probiotic growing you will probably want
[SPEAKER_00]: to attend this year's science of organic
regenerative cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the third year in a row co-founders
Joshua Rutherford of Dutch Blooms and
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton Morrison of Kingdom Aquaponics
have lined up an incredible array of
[SPEAKER_00]: educators with all new content for the
traveling event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're calling it version 2.0 going
deeper down the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year's teaching staff includes Elaine
Ingham on soil biology, Chris Trump and
[SPEAKER_00]: Wendy Kornberg talking Korean natural
farming, Kevin Jodry on cannabis genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelly and Josh from dragonfly earth
medicine, Suzanne Wainwright the bug lady,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chip Osborne on soil chemistry and many
other thought leaders rotating in and out
[SPEAKER_00]: for different cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consult the website to know who
specifically is coming for each location.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a breeding panel,
a Q&A panel, with the entire teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: staff and on Saturday night there will be
a bubble hash discussion as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joshua has built in significant informal
time for you with the teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The teaching staff is just as excited to
work with you as you are about attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also no advertising during the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only vendor booths are for cannabis
seed breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your tuition is what's paying the staff so
they all be present and attentive to you
[SPEAKER_00]: not a corporate sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even better the conference is not just for
folks on the west coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County California is hosting one
event for sure, but the show is going on
[SPEAKER_00]: the road to Vancouver, British Columbia,
Portland, Maine and Whitmore Lake,
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out your pen now because I'm about to
give you the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fabulous opportunity for you to
hear from an array of nationally
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized top-shelf soil educators all in
one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, this isn't just beginner
stuff like you get at most conventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an intensive for people like us
who totally nerd out on the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: and growing and living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you attended last year,
be assured that this year is not simply a
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every speaker will present different
material than they did last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is regenerativeorganiccannabis
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's regenerativeorganiccannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, tickets will be limited in
number to preserve the intimate experience
[SPEAKER_00]: and will only be sold in advance online.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no ticket sales at the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't wait and miss out on your chance
to attend this important gathering of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut through all the misinformation out
there and don't miss this opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn real soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerativeorganiccannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to home growers, patients,
and commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb and Specta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his lineage and the hard-earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long-time heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb, also known as Inspecta and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle, is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_00]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were here on Vashon Island,
and everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shangolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our guest this week is aquaponic
cannabis expert, Steven Reisner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Steve, during the first set,
we pretty much got a little bit of grip of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we were even talking about,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a lot of misperceptions
coming into aquaponics about what's even
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now that we understand that we've
got this split biome and we're getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: take advantage of both the magic of having
a living microbe life rhizosphere of a
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil, but then also this added
benefit of the water food web that the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are extending down into,
that's where I want to focus now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I first heard you speak about
the water food web at Joshua Rutherford
[SPEAKER_00]: and Leighton Morrison's Traveling
Regenerative Cannabis Series, like my mind
[SPEAKER_00]: was blown, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I did not, it had never even occurred
to me that all the cool stuff that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about in the soil biome could also
be happening in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just listened to you with my mouth
agape, like surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I go into like my series of
questions, why don't you just kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: dive into your explanation of the soil
food web and why the inhabitants of a
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, I dare call it living water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's the term,
but like who lives in the living water
[SPEAKER_00]: that's adding so much more value versus
just using living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the quick and easy answer is we
don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's doing any research on which
microbes are doing what in the aquatic
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, because everyone's so focused
on soil because of mass agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's next to no research being done on
freshwater aquatic microbes in relation to
[SPEAKER_01]: mineralization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the quick answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how I like to explain it is so with our
method, we call it dual root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your upper half, we have soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have mycorrhizal fungi, we have
micro arthropods, all your different
[SPEAKER_01]: worms, all your different mites,
all the different creatures that we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with in the soil and they have
their own key components.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure there's many different wise
people that have shared a lot of that
[SPEAKER_01]: critical information on your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the aquatic environment, we do have
mycorrhizae and there are fungi and fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: networks that will grow aquatically,
but they're very minuscule in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: total population.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're generally 5% or less of the total
biomass in the aquatic environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas we rely much more heavily on
bacteria and rotifer and protists and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the name of the other one?
[SPEAKER_01]: It begins with an A.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I'll think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have all these different aquatic
microbes that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have all these different aquatic
microbes and we have a much more
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiverse matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine if like all of your air was a
really good environment for microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there are microbes that live in the
air, but it's not quite the same as the
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the water, we can have much,
much, much, much higher microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: densities than you can in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on average, an aquaponic dual-root
zone setup has 167% more microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity in the root system compared
to even the most diverse living soils and
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even comparable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even your most diverse soil,
we're at 167% more microbes in the root
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 70% of the microbes in an aquatic
environment can also survive in
[SPEAKER_01]: terrestrial environments, which is why we
need to do a lot of research on these
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of these, we know that,
for example, CBD almost across the board
[SPEAKER_01]: will express higher in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: All things be considered equal than in
terrestrial expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also know given certain stimuli that we
can increase THCV expression significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: past most soil controls as well,
all but two controls that we've done so
[SPEAKER_01]: far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's mostly just having to do with
cultivar difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's all these different genes that
are being activated and that we know
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing about because we've never
activated them in soil because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: aquatic microbes or other stimuli through
the aquatic environment that's stimulating
[SPEAKER_01]: them and triggering them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be terpenes or cannabinoids
that are only found in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with some of the minor
cannabinoids, it seems like we can pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: radically increase production of certain
cannabinoids compared to our soil
[SPEAKER_01]: controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a wildly under-researched area
with a lot of room for growth for folks
[SPEAKER_00]: who are getting into the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And want to start doing a research in
something that's fresh and new to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess one takeaway I want people to
take from this is that you don't even have
[SPEAKER_01]: to do dual roots and aquaponics with your
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think about how can I increase the
microbial biodiversity in ways that are
[SPEAKER_01]: non-pathogenic and non-negative to the
rest of the microbiome?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go dumping a ton of trichoderma on
your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you had horrible pythiasis,
that might make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we got on air, you and I were
talking about we both have backgrounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: aquariums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can really hear the person out there
going, I've got an aquarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do water changes regularly,
where you've got to remove some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water and you replace it with fresh for
the good of the inhabitants of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aquarium, could somebody replicate this in
their home grow just by simply taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon or whatever or a couple cups out of
their aquarium and pouring it into their
[SPEAKER_00]: patient grow or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that overly simplified?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, you'll absolutely get benefit from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not do that in flour, especially
late in the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do that because you don't want
the nitrates from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could absolutely, when you're
doing your water change, take that dirty
[SPEAKER_01]: water, especially for veg or for a first
week or two of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even take your, when you do a water
change, take the water, let it settle,
[SPEAKER_01]: pour off the clear water and use that just
for regular waterings for your veg and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then take that thick, heavier stuff
and throw an air stone in it and a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more, maybe don't only drain about
halfway, throw an air stone in it and mix
[SPEAKER_01]: it up like a really concentrated compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe throw a little bit of your favorite
microbial mix, recharge or mammoth pea or
[SPEAKER_01]: whoever it is that you like or even some
of your own compost inputs or whoever it
[SPEAKER_01]: is, your special blend or your secret mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw the microbes in there, let it
mineralize and then put that back on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and let that unlock 70,
80% more of the nutrients that are in that
[SPEAKER_01]: fish waste that are just locked up in a
non-plantable form.
[SPEAKER_01]: This can be a great way for organic people
that have large aquariums or even large
[SPEAKER_01]: ponds that have lots of muck and stuff in
the filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great plant food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to mineralize it the way you
would with compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I can't imagine that I threw away
just down the drain all of that fantastic
[SPEAKER_00]: mulm that used to gather at the bottom of
the aquariums.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the fish waste and old plant matter
and all that stuff on the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in those days was filth,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would pull that out with the
vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm like, oh man, if I could just
have all that stuff in my plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gotta be pure gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the water web, since there's not
mycelium networks like there are in soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: what plays the role of moving nutrients
around that the mycelium does in the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it simply water flow?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only water flow, but you have
just a much higher density of
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have seed shrimp and lots more
nematodes and all different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: amoebas and protists and erotifers and all
kinds of things that are just swimming
[SPEAKER_01]: around moving and transporting nutrients
around at a much higher rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have the fact that there's a lot
more nutrient capacity in water period to
[SPEAKER_01]: hold a lot of these nutrients and to
dissolve a lot of these nutrients in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that is quickly usable both by the
microbes, but also by the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves so that it doesn't even have to
be in that solid form either.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it's just in the aquarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the aquatic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've used the term flood and drain a
couple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you go ahead and break that out for
folks who are new to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have tables, generally 12 by four
foot tables in long rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the water comes up and it floods about
the bottom five to six, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: type of setup, inches of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it has a bell siphon,
which was actually first invented by
[SPEAKER_01]: Pythagoras.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look it up the Pythagorean cup or
the Greed cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was designed to spill out all the
wine if you overfilled the wine cup of
[SPEAKER_01]: wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it does is as the water comes up
to the top, it gets a vacuum at the very
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the bell and that sucks in the air
and allows the water to drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once the water comes all the way
down to the bottom of the bell,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a couple of slits cut that break
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the water stops and then it
drains the bed completely and allows the
[SPEAKER_01]: bed to fill back up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: What this allows us to do is run one pump
and continue to continuously fill 3,000
[SPEAKER_01]: square feet of grow beds or even 6,000
square feet of grow beds off of a single
[SPEAKER_01]: pump with one failure point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put a redundancy pump in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that one goes down, it turns on the
other one and it just makes it really
[SPEAKER_01]: simple to make sure nothing bad happens,
even in the event of some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: catastrophic failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening is that one or a
couple of times a day, this floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the water level rises, you're
introducing all of this water food web
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition and microbes and various guys
into the rhizosphere from the roots that
[SPEAKER_00]: are hanging down below the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also some of that is getting
sucked up into the soil as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're doing this feeding in this
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times a day are you gonna do this
flood and drain?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the flood and drain is on a cycle and
it floods depending on the size and
[SPEAKER_01]: dimensions of the bed, anywhere between
seven and 18 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just drains and floods again and
fills again continuously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why having those roots,
this is why they're not getting choked off
[SPEAKER_00]: of oxygen because they're never living
100% of the time in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the water comes up and touches
them and gives them a feed and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: recedes and then it comes up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it creates this really nice analog
rhythm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most plants, as long as the dissolved
oxygen level is high enough, most plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are around the three to four parts per
million dissolved oxygen level.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're above that, they'll do
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously they'll do better if it's higher
than that, but that's kind of the minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know lettuce, you can get it as low as
2.2 parts per million, which is super low.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most other plants really do want to be
significantly higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time you're wanting for a five
or above bar minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the soil food web, we use soil
amendments to increase the soil viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a perfect system, we're talking
about something that is no-till with some
[SPEAKER_00]: aged soil that has mycelium networks
already set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if somebody doesn't have a no-till
setup, they've put together soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: they've added some soil amendments to
increase soil viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there healthy additives when you're
working with the water food web as well
[SPEAKER_00]: and those inputs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we wildcraft them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing to develop the healthy
vibrancy of this water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use things like DTPA iron for iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's iron and potassium and calcium
are big problems because they either get
[SPEAKER_01]: exported by large amounts by the plant
material or they are oxidized.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of iron, Fe2 gets converted
into Fe3 unless it has some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: chelation around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are kind of, I guess,
are big problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we usually handle the calcium and
potassium through pH up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our pH will gradually go down over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll use potassium silicate and
calcium carbonate to amend that,
[SPEAKER_01]: to fix that and add potassium,
silica, and calcium, as well as some loose
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of really bad information
around aquaponics that you shouldn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: any carbonates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually need to maintain at least 40
parts per million carbonates, ideally
[SPEAKER_01]: higher, or you will actually cut your
microbial replication in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we all know, for soil or aquatics,
you don't want to ever cut your microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: replication in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the biggest problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know before the show, we talked about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of information on
aquaponics, but a lot of it's just really
[SPEAKER_01]: bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of stuff that's just,
anyone with a scientific mind that reads
[SPEAKER_01]: it just can see that there's problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been one of the big reasons
that it's held up the aquaponics movement
[SPEAKER_01]: is just the fact that there's only a
handful of people that really know what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that brings us back to the drum that
you beat every time I hear you talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is there's just not enough proper
education in cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody needs to get more educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers, the breeders, the end
consumers, and more and more people are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into education.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that the quality of
the education is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people just repeating
myths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our whole scene could do a lot better
when it comes to education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually spoken at three churches in
Oklahoma where we had a pastor come in and
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting someone that can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really funny to go into a place
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would have thought that I'd be walking
into a church in Oklahoma to go talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels like one day all of a sudden
everything's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just to go from where we were
when we were in high school to where we
[SPEAKER_01]: are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to go in and speak into a church
in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some days you just got to sit back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we have a lot of struggles
right now, I know especially with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the legal stuff and people trying to
patent things and all this other mess that
[SPEAKER_01]: people get headaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes it's nice just to sit back
and go like, wow, this is just crazy how
[SPEAKER_01]: much different it is now that we even have
churches that are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a certain amount of humor too in
the fact that even though the historical
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus would not have been white,
you're a long hair hippie looking guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you on the stage, you probably did
not look all that different than the guy
[SPEAKER_00]: on the crucifix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving right along from that before I
dig myself a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things about aquaponics that
it's like one of the main things everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: knows is that there's fish involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's talk about the fish
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where in this system do the fish live and
how do you choose what fish to have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we generally choose the fish based on
the temperature of the system and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketability of the fish and then whether
or not that particular region will allow
[SPEAKER_01]: us to get a meat processing license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in most states in the United States,
in fact, all of them, you cannot have a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis facility and a meat processing
license because the meat processing
[SPEAKER_01]: inspection guys are all federal answer to
a federal board or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can't deal with anyone who deals
with cannabis until the federal laws
[SPEAKER_01]: change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to either have your fish
processed by a third party company that
[SPEAKER_01]: has a meat processing, or you have to sell
it through the pet trade, which can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: more lucrative option.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on, again, your particular
climate and things like that, oftentimes
[SPEAKER_01]: it's cheaper and more economical to do koi
or some of the more larger exotic aquarium
[SPEAKER_01]: fish, arowanas, or paku or some of the
more exotic plecos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a lot more sense financially to
raise those and flip them every 12 to 24
[SPEAKER_01]: months than it does to sell meat fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you do choose the meat fish,
I mean, the only one that I'm thinking of
[SPEAKER_00]: that people use are tilapia, but are there
other meat fish that people are using in
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for cannabis in particular,
channel catfish, paku, yellow perch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a few others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bluegill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could do anything that's
regionally appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another group we did snakeheads
for a vegetable grow over in India.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also do cold water,
although you shouldn't do salmonids or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that with cannabis in
particular, because the potassium levels
[SPEAKER_01]: we have are fine for most fish,
but most fish that go from saltwater to
[SPEAKER_01]: freshwater, when they regulate that salt,
the potassium seems to become a much
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger problem with tilapia being the one
exception.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it tends to kill them pretty quickly
when they get into the ranges we're in for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So them and white bass would be the one
that we had some trouble with when we were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing our testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would avoid those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I see the illustrations online
explaining a system, very often they will
[SPEAKER_00]: simplify it and they'll just have what
looks like a fish tank below the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I imagine that that's not actually how
it is because these tables are large and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is how it works in the real world that
somewhere near the table set up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse or wherever it's going to be,
there will be a, you know, several hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon tank and it is filled with the
fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're simply piping the water
over to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people think that the fish are
actually living in the plant roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will happily eat the plant roots in
most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cool, it's a cool thing to picture
in your head though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of the swimming between the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds cool, but yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having them munch on the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it does work really well though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked a little bit about this in the
past is those little colorful shrimp that
[SPEAKER_01]: you like a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neo-caridina heteropoda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work great to keep the root systems
exfoliated and then keep the detritus and
[SPEAKER_01]: the algae out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so we actually have sump tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything flows back to the sump tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beds pump up from the sump tanks and
go into the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water goes into the beds and then back
down from where the plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a separate loop where we
have the aquarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water pumps up from the same sump over
to the aquariums.
[SPEAKER_01]: That goes from the aquariums gravity feeds
in through two sets of filters and then
[SPEAKER_01]: goes back down into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can reroute that depending on
where we want it to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally we'll keep a mixture of a couple
of, you know, a bunch of different tanks
[SPEAKER_01]: so that when we're rotating fish out,
if I have a bunch of fry, obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not going to produce a whole lot
of fish waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can balance that out with,
you know, another better or another fish
[SPEAKER_01]: tank or two so that we can maintain,
you know, pretty even nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless of our harvest cycle with the
fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So making sure you have, you know,
extra fish tanks and you can work a
[SPEAKER_01]: rotation like that is one thing they often
see people don't do well on the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know, and there's other stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: People put UV sterilizers on them,
which you shouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it causes mineral issues with
boron and some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of just people that
tell you you don't need filters or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all kinds of goofy stuff out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I remember from when I was
raising these shrimp, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had like 35 aquariums and I would often
share water between the aquarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if one aquarium went south on it
and got out of, out of balance,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not want to share that water in my
other tanks because I didn't want the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease or imbalance, whatever the problem
was to spread to my other tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this case, we're directly feeding
from the aquarium into the flood and drain
[SPEAKER_00]: tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much hassle or potential for disease
transfer is there from an imbalance or
[SPEAKER_00]: disease in the aquarium to then be
transferred to our plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to date, there is no known plant
pathogens that can go from a fish into a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, you could absolutely have things
like in theory, you could have E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli or salmonella or some other things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually the University of Hawaii did
seven years of study where they were
[SPEAKER_01]: intentionally infecting, infecting systems
and had no, you know, tissue samples test
[SPEAKER_01]: positive in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that includes, you know, intentionally
introducing pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And University of Arizona, University of
Wisconsin have also done pretty extensive
[SPEAKER_01]: food safety studies on that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then University of Kentucky State's
actually done stuff on probiotic
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigation with that using lactobacillus
fermentation microbes and then introducing
[SPEAKER_01]: those and using those actually to
eliminate even non-pathogenic E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of aquaponic systems will test hot
for E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli that's human pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could drink the water, you won't get
sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's a species of E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and it will give you a false
positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can absolutely use that even to
eliminate those false positives as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a, it's a really good way to
do something in a way that's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: imbalance your whole system as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's lots of different solutions
depending on what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we actually, on all the systems I
designed, we can rewrite any of the beds
[SPEAKER_01]: to any of the sumps and any of the fish
tanks to any of the sumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if we have, you know, sick fish,
I can bring that fish tank offline and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else will still operate just
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe I have to do a little bit
more balancing with some of the flow
[SPEAKER_01]: rates, but it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this allows you to have that kind of
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have, you know, somebody drops
something and breaks a valve or goes to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn a valve and it snaps or these things
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have that kind of ability
to compartmentalize and shut down things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe you have an earthquake and it
breaks, you know, part of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, tree falls down and breaks part
of the system, but the rest of it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need that be able to isolate the
system and keep as much production online
[SPEAKER_01]: as all times as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we plan all that into the design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that would be the one time
we'd break out a UV sterilizer or an
[SPEAKER_01]: ozonator or something like that would be
just to put on an offline tank just to
[SPEAKER_01]: treat the fish that are in there because,
you know, we generally don't want to use
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that we have to, you know,
we'll treat them with Lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give them, there's a, a cattle
medication you can use as a last resort
[SPEAKER_01]: called Prohibit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is actually for aquaculture that can
be used for fish for human consumption
[SPEAKER_01]: later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's a 90 day cool down time or
a hundred or 180 days if you're in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, hearing you describe
that I'm imagining a whole lot of plumbing
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, with, with regular soil
cannabis, I mean, pretty much you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can take a flower pot, throw soil in
it, put your seed in it, water that baby
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll have a plant of, of some degree
of success, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then from that point on,
as you learn more, you can make your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aquaponics though, like you need to have a
certain depth in what you're doing just to
[SPEAKER_00]: plan and strategize and build one of these
in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that, you know, especially
in the idea of measure twice, cut once,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the, the install is probably by far
the biggest hassle of the whole aquaponics
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And absolutely the, the, I do a lot of
design work for different companies and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and design farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mainly what I do these days is
design them or, or help people that have
[SPEAKER_01]: already built them that need help with
their SOPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but absolutely, yeah, it's a lot of
plumbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't know what you're doing or
design it wrong, I know there's a company
[SPEAKER_01]: out there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the bigger aquaponics
companies that has a cannabis specific
[SPEAKER_01]: system that has given me a lot of
business, which I'm thankful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they get the, the out of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get the, the boxed solution and
they're like, Oh, we need, we need better
[SPEAKER_00]: than the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we're talking about a
lactobacillus acid serum, I told you,
[SPEAKER_00]: and since it's trending so much,
I got to ask, is there, are there KNF
[SPEAKER_00]: Korean natural farming applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: For aquaponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually will use IMO one liquid IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use FFA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use IMO three, just too much
sugar, you know, and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it wouldn't make sense,
but you know, anything that would make
[SPEAKER_01]: sense within an aquatic environment is it
works perfectly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we'll use OHN and all those
things are perfectly fine to use in your
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics system.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, you know, what's interesting with
OHN and people talk about alcohol dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have Acetobacter bacteria that live
in your soil and Acetobacter love to feed
[SPEAKER_01]: on nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually use like in a reef
tank and I don't, I don't know how much
[SPEAKER_01]: you remember this from aquariums,
but in aquariums, you can actually do
[SPEAKER_01]: something called vodka dosing where you
can dose with vodka to feed the
[SPEAKER_01]: Acetobacter to break down the nitrogen and
make it non-lethal to the fish and bind it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually do very similar to
dosing with soil or aquatics from for
[SPEAKER_01]: plants as well in terrestrial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite as extreme as it does in an
aquarium, but it'll still give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction in nitrogen so that you're not
ending up with too much end coming into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was at the regenerative cannabis
conference that you were speaking at back
[SPEAKER_00]: in Michigan this summer, Elaine Ingham
said, you know, she pointed out the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of having real sunshine hitting
the soil of our plants because you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunshine hitting the plant of course
is gonna give us the widest terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles and let the plant express itself
most naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also how the sunshine hitting the
soil around the base of the plant was
[SPEAKER_00]: having all this interaction with the soil
microbes directly and the warming of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and like, you know, all this analog
magic that was happening when the sunshine
[SPEAKER_00]: hits the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people will fake the sun with lights
indoor, but those lights don't fake out
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a certain amount of microbe
activity loss because it's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, authentic sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that cross apply over to
aquaponics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it very easy to do an aquaponics setup
under artificial lights or are you needing
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this under glass roofs or in
greenhouses or something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had equal success both in indoor and
with greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally, I think anyone who's not
doing greenhouses at this point is wasting
[SPEAKER_01]: money on cultivation because you're not
gonna be around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when the price comes down,
ultimately there's just, you shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: investing in indoor at this point unless
you're doing breeding or really specific
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars or something like that where it
really makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise for commercial production,
you're just, you're gonna get priced out
[SPEAKER_01]: the market pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so last question before we go to
commercial, like, you know, I'm a big fan
[SPEAKER_00]: of polyculture and companion planting and
we talk about it a lot on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there opportunities for doing
companion planting in aquaponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm a big fan of companion planting
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're big on purslane, watercress,
thyme, majorum, creeping lavender,
[SPEAKER_01]: creeping rosemary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all different types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our aquaponics systems, we find that it
really helps with just healthier root
[SPEAKER_01]: systems in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that it's helping both the,
you know, we know about polyculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's good for the soil and good for
the plants and the rhizospheres talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other, all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we find that companion planting helps
with the thriving of the water as well or
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping it balanced or are there
advantages to companion planting?
[SPEAKER_00]: To the living water?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could definitely, especially when
you're coming into flower, if you plant
[SPEAKER_01]: them, you know, about second half of edge
so that they're really starting to take
[SPEAKER_01]: off when you're coming into flower,
it can really help reduce the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: levels in the system, especially locally
around the plant, which can be really
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably, I guess, the biggest
benefit from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also love to do a chamomile,
which is another one, just because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: such a bug magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, that's totally cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go ahead and take a look
at our second short break and be right
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is aquaponic cannabis
expert, Steve Reisner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivators who grow in living soil are
very particular on what inputs they use in
[SPEAKER_00]: their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They educate themselves and painstakingly
create compost and nutritive teas to
[SPEAKER_00]: create thriving soils that will produce
the very best expression of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many living soil farmers now believe that,
over time, seeds become acclimated to the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of substrate they are grown in.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a seed that was bred in
synthetic fertilizers may not immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to do in a living soil
environment, slowing their growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regenerative seed cooperative is a
different kind of seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regenerative seed cooperative only
provide cannabis seeds that were bred in
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil and using probiotic growing
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when you germinate in soil,
the seed's genetics will recognize the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and immediately start
interacting with microbes and fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds are described as
bio-intelligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of cannabis breeders
participating in the regenerative seed
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperative is rapidly increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already signed on are Dutch Blooms,
Heartrock Mountain Farms' Pride of Lion,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sebring Seeds, and Mount Baker Highway,
with more being added every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds are regulars, autoflowers,
and hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: A significant amount of the profits go to
cannabis seed preservation projects
[SPEAKER_00]: available to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to take every advantage that
you can when growing in beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then consider buying your seeds from the
regenerative seed cooperative at
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerativeseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's regenerativeseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis in greenhouses is taking
over the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: An efficient and effective blend of
sunshine-grown terpene profiles and the
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment of indoor,
greenhouses can be the best of both
[SPEAKER_00]: worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many greenhouse operators,
though, building their greenhouse before
[SPEAKER_00]: gaining insight into how cannabis
greenhouses differ from ornamental crops
[SPEAKER_00]: can be the start of a world of hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Branstad and his team at Greenhouse
Advisory Group have the experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: technical know-how to help you avoid these
pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Branstad has been helping cannabis
growers find locations, design,
[SPEAKER_00]: build, and equip their greenhouses for
over a decade, first starting in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California, but expanding over the last
five years to helping clients throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has an impeccable reputation for both
depth of knowledge and kindness in
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear Eric explain some of the
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to overcome them in episode number 41
of the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where I go in the country,
good people with smart backgrounds still
[SPEAKER_00]: are making the mistake of building without
knowing cannabis, and it causes them to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn through capital and time fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has their own failure point.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some, it is improper ventilation
planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: For others, it is surface temperatures of
the building or the plant's leaves or
[SPEAKER_00]: both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks that build their greenhouse
from scratch make really basic errors like
[SPEAKER_00]: placement of the greenhouse on the
property or not understanding the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment where the greenhouses sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have even built a decent greenhouse,
but are inefficient in their deployment of
[SPEAKER_00]: light deprivation techniques and never
really hit their target yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great when you learn from your
mistakes, but it's even better when you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from the mistakes of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you bring on Greenhouse Advisory
Group, you will learn from the mistakes of
[SPEAKER_00]: their many clients, and you'll take
advantage of the best practices developed
[SPEAKER_00]: by Eric Branstad over his years of working
with clients just like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: From location development to choosing a
builder and tricking out your new
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or retrofitting or rescuing
your failing greenhouse, Eric will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit greenhouseadvisorygroup.com to learn
more and connect with Eric and his team.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Greenhouse Advisory Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our guest this week is aquaponic
cannabis expert, Steve Reisner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first two sets, we figured
out what the hell aquaponics are,
[SPEAKER_00]: and during the second set, we really got
into what's going on on the science and
[SPEAKER_00]: biological levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here on the third set, we're gonna
talk about what happens when things go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Steve, from the first two
sets, it seems to me that the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: problem is when things get out of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because just like the soil food web,
when one input category or chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: category or microbe category, when one of
them gets, you know, too overabundant or
[SPEAKER_00]: too lacking, it really messes with the
different layers of magnitude,
[SPEAKER_00]: the different trophic layers of life,
and then the whole thing just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that this is what happens as
well in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use a combination of organic
mineral salts as well as working more
[SPEAKER_01]: towards fermented inputs as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big shout out to Patrick from Soil King.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has that amazing Excel sheet over on
his website of all the different mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs and different plants that you can
mineralize through compost teas or
[SPEAKER_01]: ferments to extract that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're doing a lot of testing on that
now in a couple of different facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're working with to try and replace
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even some of those minerals that we're
using, but we use a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium silicate and calcium carbonate
for pH up, DTPA for iron, and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, other, you know, sulfates and
some other stuff for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: organically certified, of course,
when possible to address some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, again, we're
getting 85 to 90% of them with the
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics and just doing very minor
changes or unlocking them through other
[SPEAKER_01]: means like we talked about with the
fermenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're doing a hybrid of those two
really is the solution for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the big ways that I guess maybe
we're different is that we're testing our
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in the aquatic environment every
two weeks at most of our facilities that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are down to every four weeks
just because it's down pat with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars that they're running.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people, again, every two weeks,
they're sending out their water just to
[SPEAKER_01]: find out, hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, where are we at with
micronutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just making really tiny mineral
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, you know, even when we are dosing
with something, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: three PPMs or five PPMs different,
something real small, just to keep it in
[SPEAKER_01]: range and to keep everything rocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, the fish waste is providing
the vast majority of what we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just amending the little bit that we
can't either put through the fish or stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be oxidized or, you know,
otherwise would be harmful if it went
[SPEAKER_01]: through the digestive tract of the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my experience, aquariums go bad
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, granted, you know, my aquariums,
you know, I probably had 35, 40 gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder aquariums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 40 gallons is not a lot of water mass,
if you will, total volume to buffer
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if something got out of whack,
it really got out of whack quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a two part question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, what is the normal range for
the size of these aquariums, even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have multiples of them, that you're
pulling your water from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does the amount of water, plus the
fact that it's filtering to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: degree through some amount of soil,
does that all just kind of like buffer it
[SPEAKER_00]: all and make it way less likely that
things are gonna go bad really quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like every other, you know,
testing every other week doesn't sound
[SPEAKER_00]: often enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's kind of two parts to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, the main systems that I see people
growing cannabis in is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: two IBC systems, which is around 400
gallons of water for the home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of the normal size,
I guess, that I see the most, just two of
[SPEAKER_01]: those IBC style aquaponic systems that
there's lots of public information on and
[SPEAKER_01]: how to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the commercial systems,
I'm mostly seeing stuff that's in the 30,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20,000 gallon to 30,000 gallons size
systems, oftentimes split into either five
[SPEAKER_01]: to 10,000 gallon sections.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are loops on their own that can all
be either cross plumbed or separated into
[SPEAKER_01]: individual systems, depending on,
you know, the needs and desires of the
[SPEAKER_01]: system operator at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that, I guess, probably isn't the two,
I guess, layouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know most of the systems that I'm
designing are right around 10,000 gallons,
[SPEAKER_01]: between eight and 10,000 gallons per loop,
which is a sump tanks, fish tanks,
[SPEAKER_01]: filtration and grow beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that generally provides, you know,
a 3000 square foot bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we'll get maybe a 4000 square
foot bait, again, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this this sheer size just slows
down the speed at which any imbalance can
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the in an aquarium, what happens is
that you have a high you have nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ammonia and fish waste build up and
cause it gets converted by microbes into
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrates and nitrates get higher and
higher and higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they can dissolve down or they
end up dissolving the alkalinity or
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolved carbonate hardness, which then
when that gets super low causes an
[SPEAKER_01]: instability in pH, and then the pH
crashes, which ended up in a very large
[SPEAKER_01]: volume of water, it becomes almost
impossible to do that without having to go
[SPEAKER_01]: to pretty big extremes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's absolutely possible,
but you have to really strip the water
[SPEAKER_01]: down or use RO water from the beginning
or, or something else that has no
[SPEAKER_01]: stability to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a healthy system will have carbonates,
especially if you're dosing with the right
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you end up low in carbonates,
you can always dose with potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you can get that OMRI certifiable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then you're adding, you know,
two carbonates and one potassium for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, for every dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about, you know,
the the likelihood of the the aquariums to
[SPEAKER_00]: go south on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it occurred to me that,
that really, the even though the aquarium
[SPEAKER_00]: and the fish are there to serve the
cannabis grow, what essentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis grow is, is a big badass filter
for the aquariums and makes it way,
[SPEAKER_00]: way less likely than, you know,
a traditional aquarium to go south on you
[SPEAKER_00]: just because you have this elaborate
living filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest pitfalls, I guess the short,
to go back to what your original question
[SPEAKER_01]: was, is pH and temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're maintaining your pH and you're
maintaining your temperature, either
[SPEAKER_01]: through heaters or chillers, or a
combination thereof, depending on your
[SPEAKER_01]: climate, it's going to be pretty hard to
have an outbreak short of someone dosing
[SPEAKER_01]: something into the system that shouldn't
be in there, or loose electrical current,
[SPEAKER_01]: or your neighbor over sprays with
glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that happen in a commercial
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it turns the if anyone's curious and
aquaponics glyphosate will turn the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: ivory.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the top down, they go from green to
ivory in about two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that sounds really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I need to pull up a picture of
that online to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one more question here, but before we
move on to this new interesting project
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when we're talking about
soil, there are ways that the soil can no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer allow us to tend to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean specifically is we can get
a compaction layer right that becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobic and we go to water and the
water just, you know, goes off the the
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the top of the pot and down the
sides and right out the holes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are drying out our pot because
the top layer is hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, somebody's pH could get all
screwed up and we'll get what people
[SPEAKER_00]: generally call nutrient lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are these are both ways where
we're trying to do our best for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the the ecosystem is saying,
oh, we're too far down this path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything like that in
hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way that the system can can try
to lock you out from making your changes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say the biggest similarity with
that would be if you don't have adequate
[SPEAKER_01]: filtration, you can end up with sludge
buildup in your sumps and your grow beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can absolutely lock up nutrients
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the ways we mitigate that is
again, through healthy microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: lactobacillus and other compost team
amendments, but into your beds
[SPEAKER_01]: occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also with one of my favorite creatures
we have in the system, which are black
[SPEAKER_01]: worms, which if you're an aquarium person,
I'm sure you'd remember those little tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: black worms you get at the pet store to
live feed your tropical fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you put them in your aquaponic
system, they love to feed on the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that that go in those
little little anaerobic pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll actually go out and seek that
out and tunnel through them and bring
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygenated water into those and break them
up and actually seek out those areas like
[SPEAKER_01]: little anaerobic seeking missiles that go
and break up those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually put them in all the
aquaponic beds and they're one of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, secret weapons, I guess,
that I would say that we use to eliminate
[SPEAKER_01]: sludge because they do such a good job and
they'll kind of maintain their population
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the amount of sludge in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they end up blowing through and
they have some baby fish, they're great
[SPEAKER_01]: fish food too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't really hurt anything and
they're just a great way to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with your red wigglers and your
earthworms that you would have in your
[SPEAKER_01]: grow beds, you kind of have three
different sizes and they can break up all
[SPEAKER_01]: that waste and keep everything nice and
flowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, just keep the biologicals
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the dissolved oxygen is high
enough, even those worms don't care about
[SPEAKER_01]: being submerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's finish up talking about these
cool projects you've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a unique situation because since
you design and design build aquaponics for
[SPEAKER_00]: folks, you essentially go to where the
work is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you have set up where you
live and then you set up your grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you kind of stay put.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a traveling guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from what I understand right now,
you're in Oklahoma, but then you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some great news that you're going to share
with us that you haven't talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you tell us just what you're
doing in Oklahoma and then a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about this project before we wrap up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm out here in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of different aquaponic
producers out here that I've been helping
[SPEAKER_01]: do both design work and SOP work and some
troubleshooting work for some guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: got started a little bit before I came out
here and really helping get them back on
[SPEAKER_01]: track and kind of helping the guys out
here get used to the normal regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: market that we've all grown to love in
Oregon and California and Washington and
[SPEAKER_01]: who doesn't love hours of paperwork?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just crossing your I's and dotting
your T's and doing that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But depending on when this episode airs,
you'll be the first place that this gets
[SPEAKER_01]: announced is we're going to be part of a
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to leave out the other people
that are on it just because I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: when this is launching because of that
part can't be out before the press
[SPEAKER_01]: release.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got permission to say the rest of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a company called a Gillian and
we were going to have one of the as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm aware, one of the largest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We currently have one of the largest
licenses on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have in terms of how many thousands of
hectares it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to begin starting in about
three or four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the yeah, about four
weeks from now we'll begin planting in
[SPEAKER_01]: South Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one hundred and forty seven
thousand square foot facility we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be building out as phase one and then
rolling into thousands and thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: hectares once our facilities basically get
a function as a nursery for thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: hectares that we're going to be producing
out of South Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun working on a project
that's this scale and working with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the amazing people that are on our team.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have people that you've had on your
show before that are part of our team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really going to be awesome to
kind of do something that's not only large
[SPEAKER_01]: scale, but, you know, regeneratively
minded and sustainably minded,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also gives back to the local community
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be looking working hand in hand with
local farmers and making sure that a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the local farmers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are getting a large percentage of the
profits back into the country and that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not just getting exported out of
there like a normal situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have a lot more details coming
out on that one in the press release along
[SPEAKER_01]: with the groups that we're working with
and some of the other big names that are
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm super stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be once the construction is done
in the nursery, as far as I'm aware,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll have the largest aquaponics facility
on the planet.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some cool bragging rights right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to be cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you would hit on the equity
aspect of it, because you were telling me
[SPEAKER_00]: about that a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still think that cannabis equity is
new to a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a really interesting
aspect of your project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a couple of different licenses
that we have under that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But part of those licenses are half owned
by the African Farmers Association over
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure I mispronounced that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in the actual name of the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I don't have the paper in front of
me at the moment, but we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: donating it to them, which is going to be
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they own half the license and we'll be
working hand in hand with their farmers to
[SPEAKER_01]: get best practices as well as a way for
them to export it back out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also working with a track and trace
program that we've developed that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be part of our system for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So allow farmers to get paid directly as
well from people and even allow people to
[SPEAKER_01]: pay ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those runs, you know, if you have a
farmer and he's really skilled and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have someone overseas that wants to put
money down on their next run because they
[SPEAKER_01]: thought the last one was bomb and was
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This allows people to do that and allow
these farmers access to money that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be totally off limits or or it would be
filtered out by the guys at the docks or
[SPEAKER_01]: the ports or all the other 10,000 ways
that these guys get ripped off that we all
[SPEAKER_01]: know about and half of us have had done to
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to kind of streamline all
that and move the banking directly into
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of system and remove a lot of
the potential for the middlemen and just
[SPEAKER_01]: work out solid contracts for transport and
simplify and get rid of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: riffraff and a lot of stuff that both
scares away investors, but also really
[SPEAKER_01]: screws over the farmers that are actually
the dudes that are growing the weed that
[SPEAKER_01]: have the skills and the knowledge to give
us the medicine that we want in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know how much those guys get
screwed in these four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anyone that's been to Jamaica or
any of these other places knows how badly
[SPEAKER_01]: those guys get screwed over and and robbed
in a lot of cases as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to help really break
through a lot of that and get it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have a facility both in Cape Town
and then over in East London for phase
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a rollout and a couple of
other areas in the phase two.
[SPEAKER_00]: How exciting that's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, two things come to mind right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that number one, just the the cool
cultural aspects of being in South Africa
[SPEAKER_00]: and the beauty and the different insects
and the cool trees and the different
[SPEAKER_00]: sunsets and and the different smells and
like just being somewhere exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also to be living there for a while
and to get your hands on all these like
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of African land races that
you're going to have your hands on because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be meeting cool people who
live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also cannabis folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my God, you've got to be so
excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude, I am super stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm even more stoked because the
cultivars that have been doing the best in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma actually have been the Malawi,
the Swazi and the Durban crosses that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been funny that like I've been
growing those pretty much all summer and
[SPEAKER_01]: and now I'm going to be going and growing
them again in a couple of weeks here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to begin planting November
1st, but we got to do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: setup and training with the guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: One interesting thing is when you go to
these more far flung places is a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times you have to redo all of your
education material into Ikea directions
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of these guys don't they
know a little bit of English on reading
[SPEAKER_01]: and writing, but they don't know a lot of
reading and writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to basically redo all of your
manuals and instructions and SOPs into
[SPEAKER_01]: something with pictures or video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you can't just rely on that to
be forever like a resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's definitely a challenge that I've
found, especially working in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up going back home for a couple of
weeks and coming back with my whole DVD
[SPEAKER_01]: collection, you know, a bunch of the Jorge
Cervantes DVDs and the Mr. Green thumb and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the old good ones and the VHS and I
gave them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, here, watch all these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because frankly, it's the easiest way to
try and wrap their heads around some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the concepts that otherwise can be quite
difficult to explain without visualizing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been another challenge I found
both in South Africa and working with some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the guys down there, but also in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's not like poo-pooing them
for not knowing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a challenge that comes with the
industry, especially with farmers that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been, hey, if you're a really good
farmer and you're crushing it and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing well, well on food production,
you don't really need to learn to read at
[SPEAKER_01]: any point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trained well, I mean,
obviously you do for self-growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I mean, as a point of reliance,
you can get by in a lot of parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Steve, thank you so much for taking
your time to share all this with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, it's very exciting
to find out that this thing that I love,
[SPEAKER_00]: this soil food web, and that I've been
studying, that now there is an equally
[SPEAKER_00]: sized, if not deeper and more unstudied
rabbit hole to go down in this water food
[SPEAKER_00]: web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just fantastic that you helped us
open this door up for a lot more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks so much for sharing your
expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, if anyone's a college kid
looking for a way to make a mark for
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself or a way to develop products,
get into the aquatic mineralization stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably billions of dollars of
microbial products in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worth the research, it's a wide open field
and something you can definitely do well
[SPEAKER_01]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you mind if I mentioned the podcast
too?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to plug it, but you go ahead
and put it yourself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also have the Growing with Fish's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's inspired by people such as yourself
that go out there and put out a hardcore
[SPEAKER_01]: education and try to get the realm away
from the teaching and more into academia
[SPEAKER_01]: and more into science.
[SPEAKER_01]: As much as we love the old ways,
it doesn't really help us get taken as
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously by the agricultural field and
advances in the sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really awesome to have more
science-oriented podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a podcast every week on
Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6.30 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have guests from all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Shango was just on it not too
long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can check out his interview on
there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we just try to put out education
every week that's circused around
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative soil and aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to hear more from aquaponic
cannabis expert Steve Reisner,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know you do, you can check out the
Growing with Fish's podcast that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be on your favorite podcasting app.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also check out his incredible
YouTube channel at youtube.com forward
