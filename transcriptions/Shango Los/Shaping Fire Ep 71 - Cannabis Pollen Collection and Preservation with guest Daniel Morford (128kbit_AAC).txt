[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny how some things are evil until
they are not.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was getting my start in
cultivation, male cannabis plants were a
[SPEAKER_02]: scourge.
[SPEAKER_02]: They essentially damaged the female plants
that we were trying to grow as medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: and we had to be on the constant lookout
because they were sneaky and they could
[SPEAKER_02]: get missed.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mentor, Hector, enjoyed the hunt though
and catching the boys before they could
[SPEAKER_02]: get at the girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't long though before we started
thinking about crossing particular plants
[SPEAKER_02]: to make a more reliable medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly, those male plants had a role to
play and the pollen was valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, cannabis breeding is so hot
right now and pollen is more valuable than
[SPEAKER_02]: ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you used CBG-dominant cannabis
flower, tincture, or other preparations in
[SPEAKER_02]: the last six months?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Ethan Russo asked me to let you know
that he and others are conducting a study
[SPEAKER_02]: to determine the benefits and drawbacks to
cannabigerol and they would love your
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: The questionnaire takes about 10 minutes
and can be anonymous if you wish.
[SPEAKER_02]: The study is available at bit
.ly//cbgstudy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's bit.ly//cbgstudy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the link is in the notes for this
episode on shapingfire.com too.

[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest today is Daniel Morford of Heart
Rock Mountain Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniel is a lifelong cannabis farmer
having learned from his dad who started
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in 1976 on their family farm in
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniel has been cultivating with a focus
on breeding for some 17 seasons now and he
[SPEAKER_02]: and his dad continue to focus on licensed
cannabis breeding with their California
[SPEAKER_02]: nursery license.
[SPEAKER_02]: The farm has earned the prestigious
Dragonfly Earth Medicine Dempire
[SPEAKER_02]: certification for regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we'll be discussing the collection,
storage, and application of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: One note on audio quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I migrated Shaping Fire to new recording
software this week and I didn't get the
[SPEAKER_02]: settings exactly correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next few episodes that we recorded are
all fine, but this particular episode
[SPEAKER_02]: included a bit of learning curve on my
part so the mic doesn't sound as good as
[SPEAKER_02]: usual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily though, Daniel sounds fine and
we're all here to hear him anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for tolerating me recording on
the wrong mic and next week's show sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: better than any Shaping Fire in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hey, let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, historically males have been
shunned and destroyed by everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a threat to the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who are new to this part of
cultivation, why do we want to collect
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen in the first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to make seeds is the pretty much
only use right now, although we have sent
[SPEAKER_00]: off pollen for research and development as
a supplement to a company in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't heard of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty cool idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why folks want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do we collect the pollen from these
males?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it depends if you're an
outdoor grower or an indoor grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males generally flower before the
females, not all of them, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they'll start coming in
sometimes a month before the females,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on which cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That must be kind of inconvenient for
nature, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: For the pollen to be dropping so much
earlier than the ladies are ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they keep dropping those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, how my dad first
acclimatized South American and Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: sativas to the climate here in Mendocino
County was collecting that first pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: and putting it on just the indicator hairs
of these sativas, which grow off the main
[SPEAKER_00]: stock, not even in a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within a couple generations of taking
the earliest males to those indicator
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs, they had acclimatized South
American strains to the mountains of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you said that they keep dropping,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with most males, they keep dropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we find that they're actually starting
early ahead of the female flowers becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: immature, and they often are dropping
pollen throughout the entirety of the
[SPEAKER_02]: blooming process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they would, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we talk later about the open
pollination projects, but I'll eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: cut the males down because they'll just
keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to make sure that the seeds
that you have going will mature and not
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep, you know, better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to cut down on the immature
seeds because if the pollen keeps on
[SPEAKER_02]: dropping throughout the summer,
if a plant, if a female plant gets
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated at the end of the summer,
there's no way that seed's going to ever
[SPEAKER_02]: finish outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's better to just prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it depends on where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I harvested a bunch of seed ranches
yesterday, which is the latest I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: had them, but we're in a little banana
belt for our region.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For most parts of the country here,
the end of November, when we're recording
[SPEAKER_02]: this, everybody's mostly done and the
plants, you know, being seasonal have gone
[SPEAKER_02]: to mold already.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you said that your dad did a lot
with early season pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is pollen essentially the same,
whether it's early season or late season?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all viable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just, you know, different
expressions of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes the traits in the pollen
change over the course of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're doing, you know,
out, let's say you have a seed lot and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so you could select the later
flowering males in it or the earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering males or, you know, some,
some, you know, or like look for specific
[SPEAKER_00]: structure in the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, from plant to plant,
it's, there's variety, but not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: within the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that in the females too,
even a stable seed line you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're harvesting over two weeks of,
you know, of maturity and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see a similar thing in the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes you get within that two
week window, you get a few on two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: above or before that window with both
males and females.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there any, you know, for people who
will be doing this for the first time,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's always interesting to see the male
flowers form looking like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: little balls and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and then it seems like once
they, once they start to form,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're excited about it, sometimes it
like takes, seems to take forever for the
[SPEAKER_02]: first ones to pop open and start
pollinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, man, is it time yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it time yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some people who are,
you know, maybe newish and aggressive,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they start to mess with the
balls to, you know, the flowers to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: get them to pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you ever encounter that or
are you very much to keep your hands off
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but it's usually, I've only ever
really done it with like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the auto flowers or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I have actually, you know,
picked off ripe male clusters that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they have like a more yellowish
color and then you can take those before
[SPEAKER_00]: they open and you could just, you know,
squeeze them a little bit and pinch them
[SPEAKER_00]: and pollen will come out onto,
and you can just pick off a bunch of those
[SPEAKER_00]: male flowers and go right to the female
you want to pollinate and just give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little pressure and they'll send out some
fresh pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should probably consider that to be
something that we do rarely, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in extreme circumstances though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like when the timing's right,
you go, oh, wow, this male's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I want to put it on this female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so it's, you know, it can be
something you can do, but definitely the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the pollination isn't done
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk a lot about
technique here in a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but kind of generally, I'd like you to
talk to the idea of pollen being fragile,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, it's this very fragile
powder that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are the ways that some of the
ways that we can damage pollen and render
[SPEAKER_02]: it inert and not useful?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, moisture for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want to make sure that the
pollen you've harvested is kept dry and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and then I store it in a jar
with, you know, a moisture absorbing
[SPEAKER_00]: packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also during like, you just
harvested your pollen, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in the fridge unless you want to do
long-term storage or the freezer for
[SPEAKER_00]: really long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're best just to keep it in a constant
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like room temperature would be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I keep mine on the kitchen table
via air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it stays like around, you know,
70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't want to take it from
such an extreme environment like the
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge out to your garden where you're
going to pollinate because that going back
[SPEAKER_00]: and forth will limit the amount of
viability of your pollen.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're changing heat back and
forth and you're changing humidity back
[SPEAKER_02]: and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't want to be changing the state
that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one of the longest cases of
viable pollen I've heard was just from
[SPEAKER_00]: Noah Golden Figs this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had pollen that he'd harvested in
April, but it's actually still in the male
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just dried the male flower and he used
that that fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he kept it in the male flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he just dried the whole,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty cool talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't heard of it either first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, the most dangerous aspect of
collecting the pollen and as far as its
[SPEAKER_02]: fragility is, is just being careful to not
have it blow away, you know, either by my
[SPEAKER_02]: breath or a breeze or somebody setting
something down on the table while I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: working with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's designed to be carried by
light breezes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it takes that job bill seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely find myself holding it
in my breath during certain aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead and get like into that
part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, during the second set,
we're going to be talking a lot more on
[SPEAKER_02]: like scaling up the number of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we want to make sure that we kind of
go through the simple version of this once
[SPEAKER_02]: for folks who are new to this idea and
patients and home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then second set, we'll hit it a little
harder for the people who are doing larger
[SPEAKER_02]: sifts and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so will you walk us through it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming that, you know, that the
cultivator has got one male and one
[SPEAKER_02]: female, just take us through the whole
process from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you can just pretty much
leave the male alone until it starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: get nice and chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really have to worry about it
until it gets deep into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, depending on how
you're harvesting your pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to check it a couple of times a
day before in, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the easiest way someone can make
seeds with them with one male and one
[SPEAKER_00]: female would be to have them in a five
gallon pot and just take them into the
[SPEAKER_00]: shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or the bathroom or somewhere,
you know, isolated from the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, you know, and then that,
you know, let the pollen get on the female
[SPEAKER_00]: and then cut down the male rinse
everything off, you know, water destroys
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, give that female 24 to
48 hours, rinse her off, take her back out
[SPEAKER_00]: with the general population in your good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that the home grower might
want to look into, I've never used it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is in some reading books are the I
think they're on the internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're called blossom bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're they're used in seed making to
not have cross pollination between like
[SPEAKER_00]: different varieties of tomatoes and
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can literally do is you can
prune up the male a little bit and put
[SPEAKER_00]: these blossom bags over the male flower,
collect those, and then put that same bag
[SPEAKER_00]: over your over the female branch you want
to make seeds on, you know, one small
[SPEAKER_00]: branch can yield, you know, 50 to 300
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that you can, you know,
then there's a lot of fun in that too,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're when you're just learning how
to collect and use pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually pretty cool, you know,
you don't have to do an entire plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people will just take their,
you know, a few branches and maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinate it with, you know, two or one
female plant with two or three different
[SPEAKER_02]: males.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this this branch will be this cross and
this branch will be another cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and it's a great way to practice to
get your skills up and also to learn how
[SPEAKER_02]: different pollen interacts with with the
same female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's I definitely will paint some
ladies up just like, oh, I'm gonna you
[SPEAKER_00]: find a good one or this is going to get a
lot of pollen, you know, from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so the first the first technique that
you suggested was just simply taking the
[SPEAKER_02]: male and the female plant and isolating
them somewhere, for example, a shower or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a small room in your house and
just letting them be near each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've done this as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of, you know, wrap them into each
other and tap the male a little bit and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just kind of get that going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you go through what it's like to
actually, you know, tap the plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: remove remove it for for painting back on
with a brush?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you talk us through that
process?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for your average home grower,
you know, what we have done and people
[SPEAKER_00]: still do is, you know, you just once that
male gets nice and chunky and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it looks like it's going to
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe maybe it's open to, you know,
started to open or some of the you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can take that and make a bouquet out
of it and put it in either a jar of water
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can do like a jar of nutrients in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I think Josh and Kelly of
Dragonfly Earth Medicine do like a nettle
[SPEAKER_00]: tea for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just do water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, sometimes you'll get a dud
where you'll bouquet a male and it won't
[SPEAKER_00]: drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe if I didn't use just water,
maybe that would, you know, help it out.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you take that bouquet into
somewhere in your house and you some
[SPEAKER_00]: people have it under, you know,
a pyrex dish or over, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a sheet of wax paper or whatever you want
that to collect that pollen on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you let it do its thing till it looks
like you have enough pollen for what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you scrape it up, get the plant
material out, you know, put it in a jar
[SPEAKER_00]: with a moisture absorbing packet,
keep it in like a dry place, let that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen cure for a few days and then you
can put a lid on it and you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it comes time to apply the
paintbrush, you know, you wait for a look
[SPEAKER_00]: at check your weather reports early in the
morning, like right at sunrise where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: at, there's like no or little wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year I made myself some like wind
screens to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, you know, I didn't waste my
mornings getting up really early with my
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when there's a one mile an hour wind,
I'm like, oh, I can't, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or two mile, three, you know, they would
ruin my morning of seed making.
[SPEAKER_00]: But especially with the scale that I
achieved this year, it helped accomplish
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even on your small, you know,
set up some wind screens or get some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those Chinese curtains even would work
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're Chinese,
but Asian curtains, you know, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: folding ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we use the, you know, I made some with
just some bamboo and frost protection
[SPEAKER_00]: fabric remay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, and then you paint,
you know, if there's no wind, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: right above the branch you want to paint
and just tap the brush and you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen just fall straight down to the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've even seen that when harvesting
some males that were starting to open in
[SPEAKER_00]: our male garden on a no wind morning,
you can wash the pollen doesn't get very
[SPEAKER_00]: far.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you when you make this bouquet of the
flowers, and I like this technique,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is not one that I've tried that you
you know, you put it into a mason jar or
[SPEAKER_02]: something that acts like a vase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and you've got your either just
straight water or a light nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: solution perhaps in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and they start to open.
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine that there's going to be pollen
on the sides of the mason jar,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then whatever you're collecting below
it, do you put any kind of a dome over it
[SPEAKER_02]: so that the pollen doesn't go elsewhere in
the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I haven't in the past,
but you know, and, you know, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have developed, like other techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started just to scale up in the
pollen boxes, and I do have a pyro
[SPEAKER_00]: plexiglass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lid for those and I in a little hole with
a coat hanger, and I do stir them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pollen doesn't go elsewhere and
just drops into the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've made, you know, the home grower
could just use a cardboard box to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they could get creative if they
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, like when we have like eight
males, we'd have one in the kitchen,
[SPEAKER_00]: one in the bedroom, one in the back,
you know, you just you spread them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you know, certainly that's,
that's something that's perfectly good for
[SPEAKER_02]: a for a home or a patient thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, as you get more calm,
you know, as you get more hardcore about
[SPEAKER_02]: it, like you are nowadays, you're going to
want to keep those, you know, a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: excluded from each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that once the pollen is
dropped onto your collecting, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: paper or Pyrex or whatever, that then you
and then you jumped to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the paintbrush part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about taking the pollen off of
that piece of paper or Pyrex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much do you clean up the pollen
before you remove it from that dish?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like, you know, there's a lot of
stuff that drops from plants in addition
[SPEAKER_02]: to pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get my 99% clean and I use just
a couple like my, you know, Costco card or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use two cards and you know, very
carefully, I will do a very light,
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of hold the card loose in my
hand and drag it over the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gets the plant material out
towards the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I manipulate that a couple of
times and get the majority of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the plant material off with as
little pollen as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I have used tweezers before
in the past, but I've developed a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: light touch technique to get the majority
of the plant material off with just a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, tweezers will work
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, I haven't done it,
but I know some people have used like the
[SPEAKER_00]: little tea strainers or whatever,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is important to get those,
you know, often some of the plant material
[SPEAKER_02]: are the outer layers of the male flowers,
because once they pop open, the outside
[SPEAKER_02]: folds of the flower starts to dry and drop
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they drop off, they're not really
totally dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you're doing is adding risk to
your pollen, because that's essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: water, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's water in that male flower part
that's going to threaten.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say that you're not immediately
going to go over to the female plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: apply the pollen, but you're also not
saving this for months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say that you're just like saving it
for like, let's say three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you like to put your pollen in to
hold it and keep it safe until the day
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're going to use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those little amber jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure of the size on them,
but you know, they're like... A glass,
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a glass jar, you know, like the...
It was a moisture packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll be viable for two months,
at least, just in your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in a cabinet or somewhere cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constant temperature is probably more
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to manipulate it too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Room temperature, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it out of the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it out of temperature changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put it near the heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, another thing you have
to be, you know, now with the hemp aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: is aphids will really mess with your
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get them off or reduce their
population, you know, that's what we
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we lost batches of pollen to the
aphid, the hemp aphid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I'm really glad I haven't run into
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you're collecting pollen,
you're also collecting aphids in the dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what it was like?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we actually, I did,
you know, this year was a lot of firsts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first year I ever,
you know, sprayed male plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did a insecticidal soap,
knocked the aphids down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, that's interesting though,
because that's something to keep in mind
[SPEAKER_02]: though, because if you are going to use an
insecticidal soap or if you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: use anything with essential oils in it at
all, all of that could mess with the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you want to make sure that you are
aggressive with your natural pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: remedies early on so that the week that
you're expecting your pollen to drop,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not doing any of that monkey
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that hemp aphid is
tenacious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last thing I want to hit before we
go to the first commercial and then come
[SPEAKER_02]: back and talk about doing this at a much
more scaled level, you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you applying the pollen with a
just, you know, just a simple water
[SPEAKER_02]: coloring paint brush and, you know,
this isn't rocket science.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, you know, tap above it and let it
fall on it or literally paint it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or literally paint it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the next thing you said is something
that I don't usually do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned, you know, I think you said
wait a couple days and wash her down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, if you're, I don't do it
either, but if you were concerned,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you did like an indoor and you took the
female out of, one female out of your room
[SPEAKER_00]: to pollinate it, then you would wait 24,
four to eight hours to put it back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're really paranoid about,
you know, pollinating the other general
[SPEAKER_00]: population, you would then rinse that off,
that female off before you brought it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you wanted to be extra safe
that, you know, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but, but when you say rinse it off,
do you, I mean, that gives me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, you don't mean like with a
hose, you just mean like mist it with a
[SPEAKER_02]: spray bottle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it depends on how far along in the
flower, you know, if you got, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on how far you are in the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are the different options
depending on where it is in the flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Break that out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the, you know, the pollen sticks
pretty good there too, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could just mist it off at any stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would, you know, knoll the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so if we're cleaning off the plant and
I get the idea we kind of want to make
[SPEAKER_02]: any, any loose pollen that's, you know,
on a leaf or, or didn't really join with
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant, we don't want to reintroduce
that to our tent or, or put it up wind
[SPEAKER_02]: from a plant that we're not planning on
pollinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will that threaten the pollen that we have
already placed on the female flowers that
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to have turned into seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not if you wait, you know, 24 to 48 hours,
because that process doesn't start that's
[SPEAKER_00]: already impregnated that I forget the,
what the hair, the statement is a
[SPEAKER_00]: statement, which the female, I forget the
technical term, but yeah, it's already
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's job is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electrical process there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that takes us through, you know,
how to do it simply for, for one person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead and take our commercial
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we come back, we're going to be
talking about scaling it when you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're trying, you're trying to do this
for, uh, dozens and dozens of plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, as part of a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we're going to take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is Daniel Morford of
heart rock mountain farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxygen is an essential plant nutrient and
keeping sufficient dissolved oxygen in the
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaia's brand of ultra fine nano bubble
systems will help your garden thrive in
[SPEAKER_02]: ways you may not have considered.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter if you grow in soil,
hydroponics or aquaponics, Gaia's ultra
[SPEAKER_02]: fine nano bubble systems will increase
your dissolved oxygen and increase your
[SPEAKER_02]: yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Often the first sign of inadequate oxygen
supply to the roots is wilting of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant under warm conditions and high light
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insufficient oxygen results in an
accumulation of toxins and an insufficient
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of water and mineral absorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: If oxygen starvation continues,
mineral deficiencies will begin to show
[SPEAKER_02]: roots die back and plants will become
stunted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Healthy roots supplied with sufficient
oxygen are able to absorb nutrient ions
[SPEAKER_02]: selectively from the surrounding solution
as required.
[SPEAKER_02]: In studies, this has shown a 30% increase
in plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only do ultra fine oxygen bubbles
allow your plants to thrive, but they will
[SPEAKER_02]: keep your drip lines and irrigation pipes
and plumbing clean too, because algae,
[SPEAKER_02]: Pythium and other invasive species only
survive in low oxygen environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Gaia system only costs about $2
per day to run Gaia ultra fine oxygen
[SPEAKER_02]: nano-bubblers are also great for making
compost teas and wild crafted nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smaller bubbles of truly dissolved
oxygen allow more microbes to reproduce
[SPEAKER_02]: faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Gaia's website at h205.com to learn
more about using dissolved oxygen and how
[SPEAKER_02]: to purchase this simple yet amazing
technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's h205.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the national hemp program influx due
to stringent THC testing requirements,
[SPEAKER_02]: brother Seth and Eric Crawford continue to
release seeds to hemp farmers that will be
[SPEAKER_02]: legal no matter how you grow them or when
you test them.
[SPEAKER_02]: These new varieties from Oregon CBD seeds
have substantial amounts of CBDV,
[SPEAKER_02]: CBGV, CBCV and THCV while always staying
below the 0.3% THC limit and guaranteeing
[SPEAKER_02]: compliant crops for farmers every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, these new varieties cannot be
pollinated by your neighbor's uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen or a rogue male in your own crop
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon CBD seeds are non-GMO certified
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon CBD seeds was founded and funded in
2015 by Seth and Eric maxing out their
[SPEAKER_02]: personal credit cards without outside
investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They continue to refuse outside investment
that would change their company culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon CBD grows tons of fresh food on
their research farms for local food banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally tons of food.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also give away tens of thousands of
pounds of R&D flour to patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: As their company began to succeed,
Seth and Eric started donating money to
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause
too by giving millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon State University in order to
establish the world's leading cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: genomics research program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they treat their employees right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon CBD pays for full health and dental
coverage for their employees, a 401k
[SPEAKER_02]: program and their minimum starting wage is
20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus everyone shares food from the farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth has been on shaping fire a few times
to talk about novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check out episodes 25 and 37 on
CBD cultivars and the hemp market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 66 on triploid cannabis genetics
and the very first shaping fire live
[SPEAKER_02]: episode 47 with Seth and soil expert,
Jeff Lowenfels talking about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a hemp farmer and you want to
grow reliable seeds that are sure to
[SPEAKER_02]: thrive in past testing, check out
oregoncbdseeds.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_02]: buying seeds for the 2021 season.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's oregoncbdseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the topics I want to share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_02]: shaping fire episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shaping fire Instagram has follow up
posts to shaping fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Shango Los Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_02]: my successes and failures.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my own garden insights and best
practices from personal grows everywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: and always gorgeous flower photos on both
profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The emphasis is on sharing what I've
learned in a way that you can replicate it
[SPEAKER_02]: in your own garden, your own hash lab or
for your own cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I encourage you to follow at shaping
fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_02]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host Shango Los and our guest
this week is Daniel Morford of Heart Rock
[SPEAKER_02]: Mountain Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during the first set, we talked about,
you know, the real basics of what it is to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with pollen and how to collect and
pollinate one plant when you don't need to
[SPEAKER_02]: save it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in an ideal situation,
it would be that easy all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you start getting, you know,
really into breeding or producing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: different variety of seeds, for your farm
to make yourself more, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: self reliant, the numbers get up pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, one of the reasons why I
was excited about having you on the show
[SPEAKER_02]: for this, Daniel, is, you know,
when we were, you know, chatting and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, oh yeah, you know,
we did 150 different cultivars this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I'm sure that there are other
people who are doing that kind of volume,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I've never heard of that kind of
volume before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, my God, keeping over 150
different cultivars straight where,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, on a season that I do six,
I'm like, oh man, things are starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: get pretty chaotic, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you start us out with,
you know, when you are planning for that
[SPEAKER_02]: many plants, how do you think it through
in advance and then start walking us
[SPEAKER_02]: through how you go about handling that
kind of volume?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I was a little nervous
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't necessarily think it through,
but I had a plan, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, necessity is the mother of
intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when we scaled up from eight
to, you know, to 20, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I made my first prototype pollen
collection box with cardboard and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: wardrobe boxes, I pre-slit the front ends
of them and then take those back up so
[SPEAKER_00]: then I could, you know, undo those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And access the bottom of the box where I
also did a pre-cut square with wax paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I closed that back up and that
was my first pollen collection box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my male bouquet in there,
let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It harvested a lot more pollen than
previous techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we went from 20 to 50 and 50
to 75, you know, when we went to 20 to 50,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my friends in Ukiah help me build
wooden pollen collection boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, like the wardrobe boxes are
expensive and then they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple uses or, you know, one season
they're warped from rinsing them out in
[SPEAKER_00]: between uses and the water really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we came up with these really nice
wooden boxes that have a drawer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom that slides out with a plexiglass
sheet and then I have a plexiglass lid for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we have 30 and I upgraded
when I went from 50 to 75 males,
[SPEAKER_00]: got by good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from 75 to over 150, we got more box,
we got another dozen boxes made and that
[SPEAKER_00]: really helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what made with the resources I
had and the space collecting over 150
[SPEAKER_00]: males this year was that about 70 to 80 of
those were F1 auto flower hybrids with
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were technically photo sensitive,
but they came in, that was the first round
[SPEAKER_00]: and they came in, almost all of those went
through my pollen collection system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right before the full terms did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was definitely looking at
this massive in-ground male garden I had
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the auto flower hybrids came in
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Hey, I think this is actually
gonna work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was an intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, you know, many nights I was up
till two in the morning, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: first start out clearing out the pollen
boxes and harvesting the males that were
[SPEAKER_00]: ready and then spraying down everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, cause that's another thing
you can do is you can keep spraying down
[SPEAKER_00]: your males.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not, you're like, Oh,
I can't harvest this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, spray them down, however many
times a day till, you know, you're ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you're not getting pollen
spread where you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that, you know,
dragon fly earth medicine does,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like moon gazers out in Red
River Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, that's a technique that you can
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, you know, it's, you have to
be, if you want to keep males safely
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, you know, you have to find a
zone that's good for it or make a zone
[SPEAKER_00]: that's good for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to be diligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing for hand pollinating
your females, you know, you have it's work
[SPEAKER_00]: and dedication and care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there are, there are hacks
around that that, you know, you can do it
[SPEAKER_00]: safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people I know do the,
you know, put the pollen in a turkey bag
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it over the branch, which I find
you don't get as many seeds, but you also
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get as many seeds elsewhere,
which, you know, people can like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, backtracking a little bit,
you know, to let's just talk about finding
[SPEAKER_00]: the right zone, you know, where we're at
is pretty unique for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause we're at the end of a
road, you know, tucked into the hillside
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, you know, huge cattle ranch
upwind from us and national forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we get those westerly winds that
come from the coast, which is 30 miles
[SPEAKER_00]: away, you know, and where you can,
but we still have wind screens up,
[SPEAKER_00]: which the re the frost protection fabric,
the remay, I always get confused with the
[SPEAKER_00]: remesh, which is like this, the steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you get the remay and then we
get the thick, there's two microns and get
[SPEAKER_00]: the thicker micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even double it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so we, and this was our first
year doing the in-ground male garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we'd have had them in pots before,
and this is nice to get them trenched in
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, having, having two different
waves of seed creation sounds like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really working as a win for you as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know three, three.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like you have the, you know,
you've got your auto flowers and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people grow autos because they do their
thing earlier in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's very convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people will have depth autos and then
their full terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would think that with your style,
how you're describing it, it also helps
[SPEAKER_02]: with pollen collection because you can
reuse those same boxes, the ones that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're using earlier in the season for the
auto flower collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, once you've removed those from
the male auto flowers, you can wash those
[SPEAKER_02]: down and then take them on over to your
full terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that way you can make half as
many of those nice boxes that you
[SPEAKER_02]: described.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the autos and like the springtime
since we have 40 acres and our gardens are
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, are kind of spread out
throughout those 40 acres too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had different zones for, you know,
my autos I got, cause I had, I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I made little pollination rooms
in some greenhouses too, with just plywood
[SPEAKER_00]: and I use the frost protection fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had like one auto on the
backside of a shed and I put T-posts
[SPEAKER_00]: around it and I put that frost,
that windbreak with that frost protection
[SPEAKER_00]: fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would do us like, you know,
selected open pollinations and with those
[SPEAKER_00]: that were kind of contained, not field
scale, you know, these were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 by 20 were the biggest ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were just four by fours,
you know, depending on which auto I was
[SPEAKER_00]: making and how many seeds I wanted to make
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm starting to get this idea
that there, there's enough variety in how
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's, that's probably
actually pretty accurate for most farms
[SPEAKER_02]: that they don't have enough of any
particular, one particular resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the more they do, the more variety
there is in how they do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like so long as you have the
basics down of knowing when the pollen is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to drop, so it doesn't drop
unexpectedly and that you exclude the male
[SPEAKER_02]: plant one way or another, whether or not
it's with a cardboard box or your upgraded
[SPEAKER_02]: wooden box, or you make something,
you know, something with a micron mesh
[SPEAKER_02]: around it, you know, so long as it's
excluded, so that pollen stays inside and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you decide how much pollen you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you, when you've collected
enough, you, you know, you stop the
[SPEAKER_02]: process with water and then you can remove
the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like really you can do that same
process with a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques and ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really it's those main activities that
have got to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you find, you know, the resources
that you have as a cultivator that can do
[SPEAKER_02]: those jobs, you're, you then have your
special sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's, and then you're
always learning and, and, oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, you know, you know, someone over here
is doing something cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try that out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and, you know, one thing
that we're going to start moving to,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we haven't really done too much of
besides in our greenhouses is build
[SPEAKER_00]: actually like pollination chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to try this next spring
because, you know, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: attempting to breed out 200 varieties of
auto flowers that we have working on at
[SPEAKER_00]: once in our fields with, you know,
I think maybe we're going to make some
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination teepees, you know,
cause we have a, we have a fur forest that
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to get thinned and, you know,
use that frost protection fabrics and
[SPEAKER_00]: double layer it around there so that the
wind can't hit them and then let them
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will mist down the inside of
the pollination chamber to make the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: that unviable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can get in there and cut the mails
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can take the, the fabric off
and let them finish off in the full sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say pollination chamber,
you know, what I picture in my head is
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the last time we talked about
pollination chambers on the show,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the ones that Caleb CSI Humboldt has
got and, and his are indoor and they are
[SPEAKER_02]: they're negatively pressured because of
his, his HVAC pulls so much air out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: room that, you know, when he's,
when he's done, it just pulls the pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm imagining you're making a
pollination chamber that's outdoors and so
[SPEAKER_02]: probably is not going to have HVAC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you more talking about,
you know, like in an inert air
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, like where it's not being
pulled in or sucked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a, it's just a larger exclusion
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I'm just trying to stop the wind
from hitting the mails and for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the auto flowers, you know,
for if I was going to do larger ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I would do hoops and,
you know, and people have done this
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully with just frost protection,
fabric double layered up over there,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding hoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to attempt to do that with
the autos and in the springtime,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, so there'll be the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pretty much closed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a little airflow on top and,
you know, just to, so that these 200
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties won't cross pollinate with each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll, we'll be growing some
autos outside in the rows just to,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to see how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that where you are in the
Valley, you're lucky because there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not a lot of folks around,
but we should probably talk to the idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: using, you know, pollinating just out into
the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you know, you've run into this
many times, so I'm going to, I'll let you
[SPEAKER_02]: go ahead and lead and I'll follow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should we be careful about how we're
spreading our pollen around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is you don't want to see stuff
that you don't want to see it in your own
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, let alone your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I said, we're in a
unique location where we have done
[SPEAKER_00]: successful field scales, you know,
what I call selected open population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I reduce the amount of males by
structure and you know, whatever that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to say like that, but still,
you know, decent amount of pollen up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and only in the, with the autos in
the spring and the spring and early
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we don't have neighbors
close to us that were doing depths at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I haven't done open
pollination since then and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, you know, checked in with them
to see where they're at and their cycles
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was, you know, which gave me some
relief that they were in veg when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling in a lot of males, you know,
so I didn't, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important though, to be aware,
you know, I like that you have such good
[SPEAKER_02]: connection with your neighbors that you
know, who is depping this year and who is
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's always good for us to
be talking with our neighbors just as
[SPEAKER_02]: being a, you know, a healthy cannabis
community anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, like where I live on Vashon
Island, no one should be pollinating
[SPEAKER_02]: freely, unexcluded outdoors because you
know, my whole island's only 14 miles by
[SPEAKER_02]: six miles, which means that any pollen
that's produced anywhere on the island
[SPEAKER_02]: could get anywhere on the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just because pollen can travel 15
miles, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so anywhere on the island that,
that somebody is just letting pollen go is
[SPEAKER_02]: a danger to other people who are growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, especially on an island
like ours, where there are so many growers
[SPEAKER_02]: who are patients, you know, you really
don't want to pollinate a patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, garden, you know, a few parcels
down from you and kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: ruin their medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, we've talked about
before the valley where Oregon CBD seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: is in Oregon, you know, there's a,
there's a lot of both THC and hemp farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: there and they have had problems before
with, you know, rookies who are new to the
[SPEAKER_02]: scene and they're like, oh, we're gonna,
we're gonna, you know, pollinate this
[SPEAKER_02]: whole field and then, and then their whole
valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so, you know, Seth Crawford from
Oregon CBD seeds, you know, is trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: put together what I've been calling a
pollen exclusion zone, but, but he's
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to organize the farmers there to
say, Hey, let's, you know, let's all agree
[SPEAKER_02]: to this compact that we won't open
pollinate on our properties for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's benefit, you know,
not trying, not, not telling them they
[SPEAKER_02]: must not, but like having people
voluntarily get involved because really,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not really the best way to go about
it at scale anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really important to be aware of
your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while, while we're at it, I also,
I also want to shy people away,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's, it's cool and it feels,
you know, radical to make these a feral
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp bombs, you know, you like take some
mud and you take some nutrients and you
[SPEAKER_02]: take some, you take some seeds,
cannabis seeds and, and people go around
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of like just chuck them right to
try to restart feral cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the EOS and, and while the idea of
weed being everywhere sounds pretty cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea of having these sneaker males
just like pop up in nature unexpectedly,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not really a great way to go because,
you know, you're, you're pollinating your
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbor, you could be pollinating
yourself and it's really uncontrolled.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm all for more and more
cannabis for everybody, but perhaps let's
[SPEAKER_02]: not throw genetics just, you know,
willy-nilly in nature so that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: unexpected males everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that open pollination,
you know, not in the field is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: If like maybe even like not, you should
just never do it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, also we're upwind from us
is one of the widest stretches of national
[SPEAKER_00]: forest in Minas, you know, County to,
you know, not saying that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinating any gardens there,
but they shouldn't be growing there if
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I can't say that I've
never open pollinated just out naked,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in the air as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, I did that once in 2013 when,
you know, I didn't, I didn't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, I hadn't thought it through,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I thought it through and I'm
like, oh yeah, I don't want, I don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to do this again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, for those of us who have
done it, it's like, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, you know, doing it out of
inexperience is one thing, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: but how about let's not do it on purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're talking about open pollination
though, regardless of whether or not it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's outside, you know, in the air or
whether or not you're open air quotes,
[SPEAKER_02]: open pollinating in a, in a warehouse
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that you are green or greenhouse or,
or, or really closed up hoop house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you talk a little bit to the
advantages of, of what open pollination is
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and, and why it's good, because so
far we've only talked about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly taking one specific plant and
breeding and mating it to another very,
[SPEAKER_02]: another specific female.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, open pollination captures
attributes in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so why don't you kind of explain what
that is so that people have got a frame of
[SPEAKER_02]: reference for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we did a open pollination
projects in 2018 with our Lionclaw auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower regulatory and they all gave two
rounds of the pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a, you know, this, this
particular seeds, we did two rounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a early spring and a late spring,
early summer, and it was magical in the
[SPEAKER_00]: honeybees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're harvesting, you know, pollen from
the males and they were just not even
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention to the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which is cool because later that year
I read an article how, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp can that that are growing
with males and females can provide summer
[SPEAKER_00]: food for bees when it's scarce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really beautiful to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a ton more seeds in an open
pollination, whether it's in field or in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hoop house than you do with painting,
more than you're ever probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a selected open pollination so we
were looking for specific males,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're going to get more diversity in
an open pollination, even a selected open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination, unless you do, and I've done
open pollinations with just one male in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse with autos and stuff or other
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can increase the diversity or in the
smaller hoop house, you've got your stud
[SPEAKER_00]: in there with whatever females you want to
pollinate and you're still going to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more seeds that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are ways to get a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll double paint a female if I really
want to make a lot of seeds on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You paint it once and then a couple of
days later paint it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep painting it depending on how
much time you have left in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give yourself a good four
weeks to finish out where you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: painting it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a little two, three foot tall plant,
you can get a couple thousand seeds by
[SPEAKER_00]: double, triple painting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be doing an open pollination summer
2021 over at a friend's house who's got
[SPEAKER_02]: some extra space and who doesn't cultivate
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to use their greenhouse
because there's an old heritage cultivar
[SPEAKER_02]: here on Vashon called OVP, original Vashon
purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fella who used to provide the seeds on
the island for the last 20 years or
[SPEAKER_02]: something, he moved up to Canada for the
last stage of his life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was given his last 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every summer he would take his best
producing plants and he would make next
[SPEAKER_02]: year's seed out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: While it's certainly not a land race,
we kind of think of it as a climatized
[SPEAKER_02]: land race, if you will, because it's
become so great for our particular area,
[SPEAKER_02]: our short summers.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants are early to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're early to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't grow too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tend to be mold and pest resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, 20 years of selective breeding and
just open pollinated every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew these seeds once four years ago and
the plants were just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had some good turping profiles and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I didn't pop any more of the seeds
because I'm like, I don't have the skill
[SPEAKER_02]: set yet to properly preserve these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to pop a bunch of those and
just let all the males and the females
[SPEAKER_02]: hang out in one closed environment and
just nature take its course, but excluded
[SPEAKER_02]: and closed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we're doing this and why people
open pollinate is so that you can get a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice snapshot of all those genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get various different
males all putting their different genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions out and all these different
females.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the opposite of what most people are
looking for when they get a pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people think, okay, I bought a
pack of 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping for the plant that was
described to me when I bought the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nowadays, with everybody putting out F1s,
that plant the golden child plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will, may or may not be in the
pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: While many people want that when they buy
seeds, there's a lot of the rest of us who
[SPEAKER_02]: are just all like, okay, we want to know
everything that's in this genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make a wide variety of seeds and
then sift those and then start breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's called a preservation
breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: A preservation breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard that term.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gifted his last 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably popped 10 of them so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I've got 40 left.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take some number of those and just
pop them and let them go through their
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we should end up with is several
thousand seeds that in that grouping will
[SPEAKER_02]: have everything this plant can possibly do
shown in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we'll take those seeds and we'll give
them out to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Vashon and stuff and hope that the
lineage can just carry on itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm jealous of you because of course
you've got these much larger hoop houses
[SPEAKER_02]: so you can do that in a much larger volume
than we will do in a 15 by 7, 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, and we're breeding on five farms
right now too.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least we've had in farms, genetics
going on multiple farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took those 150 males and made over 400
combinations of genetics this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw your new seed list and I don't know
how he has time for actually growing the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give a shout out to my team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an amazing veteran crew and I
couldn't have accomplished what I
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplished this year without them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did take off a lot of time just to focus
on pollen collection and breeding and seed
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also running multiple flower farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a team, amazing team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been with me for a lot of them two
to five years and a lot of veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't have done what I did without my
team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some good respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and take another short
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we come back, we're going to talk
about preserving pollen and then bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: it out of refrigeration for use and a
couple things like that.

world of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and
[SPEAKER_02]: encourage loyalty in the customers you
already have, but you certainly don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: the time for it and you're not ready to
hire somebody full time for that role
[SPEAKER_02]: either.
[SPEAKER_02]: For you, I recommend blunt branding at
blunt branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kirsten Nelson and her team are focused on
improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_02]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_02]: most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_02]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_02]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_02]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only is she well-reversed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_02]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals and Humboldt at
[SPEAKER_02]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_02]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_02]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_02]: on results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal, instead of just
[SPEAKER_02]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, every single friend I have
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_02]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab a pen and paper, because the website

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los,
[SPEAKER_02]: and our guest this week is Daniel Morford
of Heart Rock Mountain Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniel, what I'd like to talk about in
this third set is preserving the pollen,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is so sad when we go through
all of this effort to exclude and collect
[SPEAKER_02]: and get it all together, and then we screw
up the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have done this many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pollen ends up getting corrupted,
and there are so many different ways that
[SPEAKER_02]: it can get corrupted, but the one that I
tend to have had the harder time with is
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping it properly dry and out of
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you see, and it looks all greased up,
and you're like, oh, damn, it's rotting
[SPEAKER_02]: right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we start with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to us a little bit more about how you
keep your pollen safe, and then talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: the different techniques that you have
experimented with to keep it over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One pro tip that I learned this year is
don't get the cheap moisture packets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the really good ones, and bigger than
you would need for the actual size jar
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these little ... I think they're one
ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they have sometimes an eighth
of cannabis in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like smaller jars that have the
pollen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a one inch by two inch moisture
packet in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some smaller ones, and they were not
as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely had a couple jars of pollen
go off this year, but luckily I used the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of them with the bigger batches,
and some of it was still ... You can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: when you open a jar and it smells sour,
it's probably not going to be viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of packets are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you using traditional desiccant,
or are you using one of the fancy brands
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're using now for preserving
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, not a fancy brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the silica ones with the little
beads in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those actually help when I go to preserve
the pollen, because it's a lot of work
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting so much pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're done with it, I put it into
single use jars, and I've even used dab
[SPEAKER_00]: jars, size small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you thaw the pollen, it's only good
for about 20 minutes, and then you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: freeze it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take it from the freezer, to the ice
chest, to where I want to use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely take a jar of pollen and
empty it into several little jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that's why some people use the
flower cutting technique, because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of little grains of pollen in
there, and you can cut it if you need it
[SPEAKER_00]: to go further on your projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done that, but you can research
that online.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say cut it, you mean cutting it
with flour?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: F-L-O-U-R, flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what the ratio is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've come across that myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that people use it because it
makes the pollen a little easier to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes further, and the flour helps
decrease the likelihood that any
[SPEAKER_02]: particular pollen piece will get wet,
because the whole thing acts as a moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just never done it, but maybe I will
start to add a little bit of rice flour in
[SPEAKER_00]: it, just to help that initial curing
process dry out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A proper moisture packet is going to do
the trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in the pollen boxes, they get to
hang out there longer than they did on the
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen countertop or bathroom countertop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a fast pace, moving so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'll attempt what I did this
year again at this scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't need to, because those auto-flower
hybrids I made that were full-term because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're the F1, 25% of those are going to
be auto-flowering in the F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll spread out my pollen collection even
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they get to sit in the box a
little bit longer, or your collection
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber, and dry out more, you want to let
it dry before you close the lid on the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar, or mostly dry, but a good moisture
packet is going to save you from spoiling
[SPEAKER_00]: your pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, sometimes it just from the very
beginning, it just doesn't cake right,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it cakes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like that nice powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a particular cross you want to
make, and you have a couple of nice males,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you want to collect pollen from each
of those males to make sure that if one of
[SPEAKER_00]: your pollen goes bad, you have some
backup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking about your process, whichever
collection method that you use,
[SPEAKER_02]: you collect it and it's probably pretty
dried out in the bottom of your pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting chamber, or if you're doing it
smaller scale, it's just fallen down next
[SPEAKER_02]: to the mason jar onto some paper or glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use a Costco card, I use a razor
blade, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bring it together dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually, like your technique,
I'm going to start using where instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: putting it all in one container,
I'm going to put it into multiple smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're right, once you bring it
out of refrigeration, you really can't put
[SPEAKER_02]: it back in because of the condensation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you always put it right into the
freezer, or do you often just use the
[SPEAKER_02]: refrigerator?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never use the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm done making seeds for the season,
when I've pollinated everything I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate, I'll put them into the
single-use jars and into the freezer for
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's long-term?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do you think that stuff will
stay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we've had some of those
power shutoffs with the whole wildfires in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been able to keep it for longer
than a year, but I did get to use it the
[SPEAKER_00]: next... My ideal breeding program for me
is ... Last year, I used frozen and fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, I just use fresh pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, I'll use frozen and fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the system I've developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like to take the frozen pollen in
the spring or summer and put it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: auto and see if it's viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You give it a trial first before you
commit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I like crossing things into the
auto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it's just for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we run into a lot
is you have one set of tools, but you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be making all of these crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's your Costco card or brushes
or the Pyrex, you're very likely going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be using some of these tools time and time
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a serious breeding program,
you can't be cross-pollinating very
[SPEAKER_02]: literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do to clean your materials,
or do you have any best practices so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't accidentally cross-pollinate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bunch of those cheap little
paintbrushes that you get in a huge pack
[SPEAKER_00]: with the multiple colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered more this year because I needed
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use them once per variety of pollen,
and then I'll put them in my mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then put them into the dirty
paintbrush container, and then I'll hand
[SPEAKER_00]: wash those in the soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the kitchen sink with soap and water,
and use them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm harvesting pollen, I clean off my
tools in between varieties of pollen that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scraping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm harvesting mails, I'll clean off
my hands, mist myself down in between
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have your mails in a greenhouse,
a spray bottle is going to be a good mist
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself off when you're done with your
mails, or change your clothes and mist
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself off, and then change your
clothes, depending on where you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: walk from your mail garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, water is a really good sterilization
technique, or water and a little soap,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a lot of people
under-prioritize the misting themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that so often, people will go from
where their mails may be on the property
[SPEAKER_02]: over to where the females are,
and people don't realize how easy it is to
[SPEAKER_02]: rub up against a plant just passing it
when she's in bloom, and brush two,
[SPEAKER_02]: or three, or eight pieces of pollen off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know that even if ... Certainly,
sometimes we'll get a flower and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: excited because there's bag seed,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, oh, this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's grow this out.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be cool, but generally speaking,
we don't want seeds in our flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially at the commercial level,
because people know that this flower is
[SPEAKER_02]: not as potent as it could have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine details like misting yourself
that can stop accidental seeds in your
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that the product that you put out
with seeds in it is going to be the person
[SPEAKER_02]: who gets it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be the one that's got the
huge Instagram following.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's why you've really got to
be on top of your game if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect pollen and make seeds outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you what, at the scale that we did,
we definitely have a stray seed here or
[SPEAKER_00]: two, but nothing peppered.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one of our gardens that's closest to
the male garden, yeah, there was a seed or
[SPEAKER_00]: two, which is a success considering what
we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, we get a message, oh,
I found a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find a seed in the eighth or a
couple seeds in eighth occasionally,
[SPEAKER_00]: most customers are going to be stoked,
but some are not going to be happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting too, the different
responses that people have to that
[SPEAKER_02]: accidental seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even I judge it differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I get it in an expensive indoor brand
that I have paid money for and they hold
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves up as being ultra premium,
ultra elite, and they're charging an elite
[SPEAKER_02]: price, I expect there to not be any damn
seeds in my flower, but most of the farms
[SPEAKER_02]: that I get flower from are regeneratively
minded folks, outdoors, Dempure certified,
[SPEAKER_02]: more like very organic minded down home
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if there's a seed in my Pinkelberry,
well, I'm actually going to be excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, this is cool and I'll be
happy about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My reaction to the seed often has a lot to
do with how premium the brand discusses
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves about how flawless they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: A seed or two, I'm perfectly cool with
that, but if you say that you're flawless,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then there's a seed, well,
then I'm all like, oh, I guess you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's indoor, it's probably from a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about taking the pollen,
splitting it up into multiple jars,
[SPEAKER_02]: putting in the freezer, and if you take it
out, it's out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really put it back in because of
the condensation that takes place.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the freezer, you want to go freezer
to ice chests because you got 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: after that thaws of viability,
and then you can't refreeze pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you got a bunch of pollen,
but when you initially harvest your
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, just keep it constant temperature,
dry, not even in and out of the fridge a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot, unless you're not going to use it for
a couple months in the same season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say it was like, wow, this is super
early mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to have anything for a month
or two, but mainly you just want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it constant temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you take it out of the freezer right
before you use it, you then put it into an
[SPEAKER_02]: ice cooler, and the reason of that is so
that you can then take that out to
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever you are on the farm that you're
going to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not, if you're in the fridge is
where you're going to pollinate or in your
[SPEAKER_02]: home, you can just take it out,
but you're talking about slowing down that
[SPEAKER_02]: window that you have to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before where I've taken out
20, 30 jars of frozen pollen, put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ice chest, gone out to my field,
and put those 20, 40 jars on 40 different
[SPEAKER_00]: females with really good success.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard this anywhere,
but it's just how I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I take it out of the freezer,
and if I had 40 acres, I would take it out
[SPEAKER_02]: to my plants in an ice chest, but once I'm
ready to use it, I don't usually like to
[SPEAKER_02]: think that I want to have it come to room
temperature with the lid on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that I want to take the lid off so
that any condensation that might form in
[SPEAKER_02]: the jar actually is immediately going out
into the surrounding air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that sound like a good best practice
to you, or do you do something opposite?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, let's just backtrack a
little bit to when we put it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: single-use jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason I like to use those silica
packets with the beads in them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the moisture packets, because when I go to
freeze my pollen, I will cut those open,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll put a little of those BBs in each
jars, and then I will use a small,
[SPEAKER_00]: actual moisture packet that will fit
inside that little dab-sized jar,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll close that up there,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always just opened and used it from
the ice chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I open the jar, I'm out in the
environment, so yeah, I open the jar as it
[SPEAKER_00]: then thaws as I'm using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I would say probably you want the
jar to be open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, using the desiccant pack in the
small jars is not something that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: considering in my example, so that's a
good thing, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just do it because it's a lot of
work, and I want to make sure that that
[SPEAKER_00]: hard work gets preserved by a cheap little
moisture packet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth the nickel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once the word gets out that you are
successful at collecting viable pollen,
[SPEAKER_02]: invariably, people ask for that,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes that's good, because maybe
you want to trade with somebody,
[SPEAKER_02]: but trading pollen is challenging,
mostly because of all of the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: issues that we've already talked about,
but I've heard of people mailing pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever done that, and do you have a
best practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not mailed pollen, but I know
people do mail pollen, and if it's dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fresh and it's packaged, I'm sure it
would most likely make it to where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going and be viable for use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have offered up pollen to some of the
grower groups I'm a part of in Minasino
[SPEAKER_00]: County, and I did that one year,
and it's a lot of work, and it was fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I usually don't advertise it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple friends that I get pollen
to that make sure to hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll hit me up and come by my house to
get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really the way to do it,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely do think that as cannabis is
increasingly normalized, that the sale of
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen is going to become more popular,
just like the sale of clones has become
[SPEAKER_02]: more popular, and therefore people are
developing new best practices for sending
[SPEAKER_02]: clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the same thing is going to be
happening for pollen, and there are
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly some hardcore heads who are
doing it, but I would not say that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: common yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I would say just like how you
get those live predator bugs in the mail,
[SPEAKER_00]: if someone was willing to pay for it,
that would probably be the best practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in these hot summers,
to make sure that it stayed at a cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and got to where it was going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's actually a pretty good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same things that I would think about
for sending insects, anything living.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same kind of head space I would
use about pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, when pollen's gone
off, it has a sour smell to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and taste, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly where I was going to finish
up, which was when you're trading with
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen, mostly you just need to take the
person's word for it and how it was
[SPEAKER_02]: handled and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there other things that you would be
looking for in pollen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not run into the sour smell you
described, but I am familiar with
[SPEAKER_02]: discoloration when it goes from whitish or
yellow to beige.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consistency of it, if it's a dry
grainy powder that doesn't really stick
[SPEAKER_00]: and moves more like sand, very
individualized there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that does come to mind,
since we're talking about pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did send some pollen off for research
and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Flora Wellness, they make,
among other things, some cannabis oils for
[SPEAKER_00]: sexy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thought that cannabis could be a male
supplement, like pine pollen's a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: testosterone booster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually eating fresh male flowers,
and you get energized, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a little buzz from eating fresh
pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know I'm going to be doing that
summer 2021 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy eating bee pollen, and it's really
good for your immune system, but I've
[SPEAKER_02]: never eaten the cannabis pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine little dried male flowers dipped
in chocolate sold at a co-op some day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Daniel, thank you so much for taking
some time and talking with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you told me that you had done such
large groups successfully of pollination
[SPEAKER_02]: this year, I was really excited to record
with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing your seeds now for two
years, and they've been universally
[SPEAKER_02]: reliable and very enjoyable, so I figured
this would be a great time to get
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for taking some time here at the
end of your season to share your
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with us and help people get a
little deeper into their considerations
[SPEAKER_02]: and use of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure, and I look forward
to sitting down with you again sometime in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future when something else fun and
juicy to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really a nice opportunity to be
able to give you those seeds and to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them to some medical patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually, we should mention that,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually how we met was three years
ago now or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I think it's your most popular
cultivar, the lion's claw, which was
[SPEAKER_02]: originally called OG Gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were kind enough to send out like a
hundred packs to Vashon for us to give
[SPEAKER_02]: away to patients, and it was the first
time that I had come across an auto that
[SPEAKER_02]: had so much of the skunky alcohol esters
in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had some real funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of the early auto flowers were
sweets and berries and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for sending out those seeds
all those years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really crazy to have so many people
on Vashon suddenly having and trading
[SPEAKER_02]: lion's claw auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, wow, they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been fun for me, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to check out a couple process and
facilities and I see tubs in their rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, lion claw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's definitely fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really got, you know, got out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we definitely have tons of
those seeds and we hope to get it out even
[SPEAKER_00]: more this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
