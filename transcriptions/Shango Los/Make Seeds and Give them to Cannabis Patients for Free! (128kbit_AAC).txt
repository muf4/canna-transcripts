[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there, Shango Lowe's from Shape and
Fire here today, and today we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a little bit of something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of my friends with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Dan from Mandalorian Genetics and
Sebring from Sebring Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I asked them to join me
today was because, you know, back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical days, growers would breed seeds
and give them away to patients because
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds were really hard to get a hold of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays, as, you know, medical
becomes more of this green rush thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are moving into doing
seeds primarily for profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a whole new and different
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we see, you know, as a state goes
from medical to recreational, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient products go away too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this continuing legalization,
which theoretically should be great for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, actually continually impacts
patients in a negative way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I travel the countries checking out
the new markets, I meet more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: people who used to make seeds for
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they decided they wanted to,
you know, get involved with legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is totally legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of those folks don't make seeds
for patients anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that something is really lost
when patients have a harder time getting
[SPEAKER_00]: good quality seeds for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I met Dan and Sebring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met these guys because we're all
interested in auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have both given me hundreds of
packs of seeds to give to patients here on
[SPEAKER_00]: Vashon Island and at the various places
that I get my auto flower talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, from talking with both of
them, and I'm going to say some things
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll make you should make them feel
awkward, but I'm going to say it in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What these guys are doing breeding
specifically for patients and then giving
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds away is something that I think
is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping that with this video,
maybe we can inspire some people to start
[SPEAKER_00]: giving away some of their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's no problem with,
you know, selling some of the seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have to pay our bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to encourage people to breed
potentially with patience in mind and then
[SPEAKER_00]: to give some of the seeds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what these guys have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, it reminds me of the medical
days when people were really in it for the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients instead of what we're seeing now
where people are more and more turning
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis into a commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dan and Sebring, thank you for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just going to ask a couple of
questions to kind of get you set up with
[SPEAKER_00]: the mindset of giving away seeds and maybe
it'll inspire some people to start
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding or making seeds for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dan, let's start with you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you got into breeding because of
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that you were breeding first and
then you moved over to patient focused
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was your whole point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what brought you to breeding for
patients?
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeding for patients came for me because
of a medical need of a family member.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, basically stage four cancer,
you know, short end of it, and she needs
[SPEAKER_02]: some pain relief and we needed a quick
turnaround and autos were the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I started seeing the benefits
from the quicker turnaround to continue
[SPEAKER_02]: that down the road and then basically
share out beyond my circle of friends and
[SPEAKER_02]: family needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet the fortunate benefit of meeting you
and making sure that those seeds get
[SPEAKER_02]: beyond that circle that when I initially
started from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they certainly have, I felt a little
bit like Johnny Apples had given them away
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sebring, I know that you as well got
into it specifically for the patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: what were your motivations?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a couple of motivations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was being able to do seed preservation
because like you have started to see that
[SPEAKER_01]: fall off a lot of the really good strains
that you used to be able to get your hands
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: These days you can't, or if you can,
you have to pay a fortune.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be able to get a hold of them and even
then they're not necessarily what you
[SPEAKER_01]: think they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, I had family members that
were in need of medicine as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: One with epilepsy, another one with
arthritis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I needed a variety of different answers
and I needed ones that would be growable
[SPEAKER_01]: and self-sustainable by those family
members so I could show them how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: ICBD outer flowers answered that for me in
both cases in varying amounts with
[SPEAKER_01]: different THC levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But both of them acted as a way that I
could hand seeds to a family member and
[SPEAKER_01]: show them, hey, you can grow a tomato,
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a set harvest date.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all you've got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your making medicine process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back to me if you need more seeds or
if it's not quite right and we'll work
[SPEAKER_01]: with you on the genetics to work it in the
direction it needs to go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that just expanded out to wanting
to help other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you, I saw that more and more seeds
were growing commercial or seed breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: were leaving breeding and were just going
into commercial cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as I saw that void happening,
people like me and you started trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: fill that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, just like you, I want to see
more people donating more seeds to people
[SPEAKER_01]: around them, patients that they meet,
sending them to us and we'll help
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute them to the patients that
contact us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that part of the community is being
lost and it's essential for part of
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping our community as a whole,
the stronger we make each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: the stronger we make ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's talk a little bit about the
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, now don't get me wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like seeds are fun to share even if
you only have one pack, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we're going to be talking about
like some numbers of packs here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't think, oh, I, I don't,
I can't distribute that many seeds or I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't grow, you know, produce that many
seeds and think that this might not be for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because just giving away a few packs is a
great last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only made, you know, a couple dozen
packs, but they felt really good to give
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so Dan, you know, what did you do to
figure out how to give away your packs to
[SPEAKER_00]: people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know some people, they feel a
little awkward to be like, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like even if I have seeds, I don't know
where to, where to give them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, organizations like here on
the Island, you know, there's an outreach
[SPEAKER_02]: to patients there and I was fortunately
connected with you and we had an outlet
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've also made some cold calls,
you know, take a look for like veteran
[SPEAKER_02]: organizations or, you know, other medical
collectives or, you know, just take a,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a quick search and you can find the
people that actually need them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just reach out to them,
make a phone call, you know, I,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's been very well received every time
I've made a call, especially since it's
[SPEAKER_02]: free, you know, I cover the shipping on it
to make sure that these people can have
[SPEAKER_02]: what they need in their hands at a price
that it's, it's free, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the chance to grow your own medications at
home and take care of whatever you may
[SPEAKER_02]: need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, having the ability to
take extra seeds and just hand it to
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody to sit here and enjoy,
you know, spreading that forward is just
[SPEAKER_02]: a, it's a great feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a good way to, you know,
strengthen the community like we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sebring, I know that you've turned
this into kind of a manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were sending out seeds,
like all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through sebringseeds.com, I ship out
any seeds that get sent in to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go through a sort of, I only take the
quality seeds and that's what gets shipped
[SPEAKER_01]: out, stuff that's dark colored,
plump, not underdone.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the underdone get set aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a purpose for those, but those
good ones all get sorted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get individually packed in packs of
15 to 30 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as long as people are willing to
pay shipping, we ship them all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them qualify as hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only send seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't send anything else, but we
absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who comes on the website and says
they want to order a pack, we take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then not all the time, but as I can
afford it when people contact me and they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have the money even for shipping,
we take care of that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps if we only have a limited number
of those that are legitimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had a pretty easy time of it so
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could definitely get to a point where
I'd have to borrow less, put a hard number
[SPEAKER_01]: on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is how many, you know,
free shippings we're going to give out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now where it seems like
everybody that's been contacting me has
[SPEAKER_01]: been honest and had integrity and,
you know, really said what's going on with
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't get the, hey, send me free
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the, I'm a son trying to help my
grandmother.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to grow medicine for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm unemployed right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you help me out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my answer is always yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've been that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my route is being that person and
living in that community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to me, they're doing what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is trying to take care of people
that are in the community that they love
[SPEAKER_01]: that shouldn't be in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so like this actually, I didn't even
actually realize this was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of like a spectrum,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I only produce like, you know,
a couple dozen packs every year and I grow
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those the following year and then
I give them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dan, Dan's producing like hundreds of
packs and he bundles them up and then
[SPEAKER_00]: sends them to organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sebring's got people reaching out to
him from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they pay shipping and handling,
he sends them seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you can do a little or you
can do a ridiculous amount, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And or somewhere in the middle,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can do as much and in the way
that fits for your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that I met these guys was
because we're all into auto flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis varieties right now, because all
three of us have realized that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: really good for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so Dan, you know, why did you
choose to start breeding auto flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for the patients that you
help?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, to touch back on what I said
earlier is quick turnaround time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the turf profiles and the
cannabinoids that we needed were right
[SPEAKER_02]: there readily available at that quick
pace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made sense too because at the time
I was, I had access to both, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: regular sexed seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could get males and females with no
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not that there's an issue with
feminized, you know, there's a lot of them
[SPEAKER_02]: available today, but it was at a time
where I was able to actually begin that
[SPEAKER_02]: selection process and kind of cater it
towards what I needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started doing autos because family
members needed something that they could
[SPEAKER_01]: grow like a tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: They needed, just like Jeff Lowenthal
said, they needed something they could put
[SPEAKER_01]: in the ground, indoor or outdoor,
do nothing but water it for 80 to 90 days,
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest it, hang it, dry it, medicine,
just that fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, no learning curve,
no nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The barrier to entry is incredibly low and
seeing how well my mother succeeded on
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that and how basically she went from
constantly being frustrated with me
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about photo periods, which could
be a real pain at times, especially for
[SPEAKER_01]: new growers to, oh my God, I can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can actually do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you and I need you, but not for
this, which to me was a huge weight off my
[SPEAKER_01]: shoulders to know not only that I could
give her self-sustainable seeds and that
[SPEAKER_01]: she could make her own medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that didn't have to be one more
thing I had to do, freeing up my time,
[SPEAKER_01]: preferably to spend quality time with her
instead of just staring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I realized, you know,
she's older, she's retiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: If she is struggling with this,
most retirees are struggling with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reality is what I had in my hand
was something I needed to distribute to
[SPEAKER_01]: the masses because there really is a whole
community out there that needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what I've seen, they're more or
less being ignored.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of seed breeders that
are breeding for retiring baby boomers,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though they're one of the largest
sections of the community that need this
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're past the drug war stuff and
the propaganda, they understand that it
[SPEAKER_01]: helps them and they want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just need people to come to their
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop down to their level and speak on
their level and their terms and give them
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant that they can succeed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So set them up for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we've been trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, of course, it's cool to
breed for cannabis cups too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not saying that you have to do one
or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're saying is that as legalization
and the green rush takes over,
[SPEAKER_00]: less and less people are really paying
attention and listening to the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: and what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are offering patient products and
patient seeds, but a lot of the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not actually what patients need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that people want to fill a
patient market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one of the reasons that I turned
into or got turned on to auto flowers for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients is because they're so covert,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants usually top out around three
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I grew some six footers this
year, but really three foot is kind of on
[SPEAKER_00]: average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you can literally tuck
those between your tomato plants and your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors won't even necessarily ever see
them, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you brought up Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should go ahead and plug his book,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a new book on auto flowers for
the absolute beginner that comes out next
[SPEAKER_00]: month, October 22nd, 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all do-it-yourself auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not really for pros.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for people new, like your aunt or
your mom or your grandma or somebody who,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Sebring Seed said, is kind of over
the taboo and they need the medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to garden it for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with Jeff Lowenfels book,
you can, boom, put that in their hands and
[SPEAKER_00]: it gives them the history of auto flower
seeds, some basic growing technique,
[SPEAKER_00]: where to get auto flair, flowers,
and, you know, a bit of encouragement that
[SPEAKER_00]: like you can do it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very simple book for beginners and
it's very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got awesome photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's got good photos of it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, so if there are people out there
who are like, oh man, I would really like
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce seeds for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice would you give them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what one piece of advice would you
give them about getting started?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say get some access to some
regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get access to regular seeds,
don't be afraid to the male.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, make sure that, you know,
you kind of isolate it too, especially if
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a larger crop and collect that
pollen and bring it over to the female and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where you can begin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could go into great detail on
that and the process and how to,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's several online resources for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, don't be afraid of that
male.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not as scary as they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, males have got terrible reputations,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they'll seed your crop and most
and nobody wants that unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: producing seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it takes a little while
to get over the fact that the male can be
[SPEAKER_00]: seen as a threat in the garden and
actually see it as a partner in making
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Sebring, what one piece of advice
would you give somebody?
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I'd like to segue back to if you do
make seeds accidentally and they're not a
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphrodite cross, I'll help you get rid
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get them right to the patients that
need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: For new breeders, people that want to get
into breeding, I would say that they first
[SPEAKER_01]: of all, don't be scared to just get in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing you've got to do is get
over that stumbling block of just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not being afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in there and just do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first crosses were total accidents.
[SPEAKER_01]: We literally just, we had three plants and
we took one and it was a male and cross it
[SPEAKER_01]: to two others and grew those out to see
what was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's really what you've got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to understand the genetics that
are stored, stashed away in each of the
[SPEAKER_01]: parents that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to understand the parents too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be able to identify what came
from each parent to help figure out the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for the genetic level,
what's going on with them, what,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what was dominant, what was
recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, you can kind of start to
work in the direction you want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: My biggest thing I would suggest to people
that want to start breeding first and
[SPEAKER_01]: foremost is honestly pick up a book on
Mendelian genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it's confusing, just work your
way through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even today, I'm still running crosses
where I'm working through charts to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out, okay, what's this, what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the ratios of what I should get out
of a cross based on whether it's dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: or recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot more complicated these days
with advanced genetics, but a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: principles still apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can understand the simplest
Mendelian genetics, you'll begin to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand in the crosses that you make
what it is you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the key really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, don't let that level of
complexity stop you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just be a pollen chucker,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is what I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not read a breeding book and yet
I've been growing my own seeds year over
[SPEAKER_00]: year and I get great plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need to do is have a female that
you like and a male that you like and put
[SPEAKER_00]: them near each other and you will get
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very often, even accidental seeds that
get made and you didn't even plan can be
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly it's one of these fun hobbies
that you can start at a novice pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: chucking level and then go all the way to
reading books and charting out dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: and recessive traits, but don't let that
be your stopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people don't have time to
read a science book and take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let that stop you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just freaking do it and give the seeds
away because putting the seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: patients' hands is the goal of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, so if people want to follow you
on Instagram and continue to pick up some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this inspiration, how do they watch
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they can find me at fullduplex
underscore AFN or at the genetic page at
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandalorian Genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you, Sebring?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me under sebringseeds at
Instagram, at YouTube where I've got some
[SPEAKER_01]: videos on how to make silver thiosulfate
as well as some growing tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sebringseeds.com website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through Facebook, pretty much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look for Sebring Seeds and if you
find a link that sends you to somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: with that name, it's probably me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last thing is, oh yeah, those links are
in the description below if you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: catch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point of this video is just to get
you thinking about making extra seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them away to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a lot of fun to make extra seeds put
them in a little package and give them
[SPEAKER_00]: away to friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You build your Cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You create the opportunity for giving
somebody a few packs and then they go on
[SPEAKER_00]: and give them to a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, good genetics get
into the hands of patients so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can be empowered to grow their own
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it doesn't matter if it's
auto flowers either.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love red plants too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you have access to, start
reproducing the seeds and giving them
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I probably made these guys a little
awkward by kind of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: using them for an example of dudes who,
or let's just say people who produce seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and give them away to patients,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are just examples of that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people like this in your
community and talk to them and maybe get
[SPEAKER_00]: together and maybe also trade with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, they didn't ask me to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually bugged them to do this video
and asked to put them on a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pedestal so that through their stories and
me saying, hey, these guys have given away
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of packs to patients because they
value that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, everybody wins,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So also do not like jump on them and be
demanding packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you've got an organization,
you know, perhaps reach out to Mandalorian
[SPEAKER_00]: .com and Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are individuals or organizations
and you're willing to pay shipping and
[SPEAKER_00]: handling, maybe reach out to Sebring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, man, these guys have got
like day jobs and they don't have a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: time for customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, you know, they try to get back to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be considerate, be kind, you know,
and if you decide to reach out for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but instead of, you know,
focusing on getting their seeds for free,
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to go ahead and make your
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially since it's fall time now and
if you accidentally had a sneaker veil and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're guarding, just gather those seeds
and put them in 10 packs and give them
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, thank you so much for,
uh, for talking with me and hopefully we
[SPEAKER_00]: will cause some more people to grow and
give away seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a lot.
Thank you.
