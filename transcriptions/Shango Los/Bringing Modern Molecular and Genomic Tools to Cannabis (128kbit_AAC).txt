[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I just wanted to say that normally,
you save the best presentations for last,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've seen Reggie speak before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen Alicia yet, but I got to
see her slides, and I'm telling you,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be the best session,
so I don't know if we can do much better
[SPEAKER_00]: after this, but it's gonna be fun,
I can tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's animations and all kinds of things
in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kicks off the cannabis genomics
testing session.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Alicia Holloway is the Director of
Bioinformatics with Bilos Bioscience,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she's gonna talk to us today about
bringing molecular medicine and genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: tools to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to turn it over to
Alicia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for inviting me here and also
for providing early coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to all of you for listening to
me talk about the work that I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sometimes wake up in the morning and I'm
surprised that I can apply the science
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've been trained to do to this
amazing field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm working with Bilos Bioscience,
and we're a high technology cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using new science to help growers
save money, save time, and grow better
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all know that cannabis has a long
history with humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've carried it to all corners of the
earth and we continue to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's clear why we do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant is possibly the most useful
plant that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use it for food, fuel, fiber,
fabric, pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that for some alliteration?
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, we've only begun to unlock its
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has huge medical possibilities,
and in fact, even as a secondary side
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of using it as a medicine,
we're seeing drops in opioid uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, as you know, potentially a 25%
billion dollar industry over the next few
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with the severe restrictions and
legal limitations that we have been going
[SPEAKER_01]: through, we've done some amazing things
with this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably heard of the iron law
prohibition when alcohol was made illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: in the underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became very potent, even deadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, we're not in that scenario with
cannabis, but the potency of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: basement breeding operations has gone from
eight to even 30% by dry weight by flower
[SPEAKER_01]: during the time that the prohibition has
been in effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basement breeding has also produced small
plants that may not grow well indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of things that have
happened to this plant during this
[SPEAKER_01]: basement breeding period, but it's also
given us amazing varieties or cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: that have flavor and chemo type profiles
that you can hardly imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that cannabis is legal in many
states and a few countries, we can really
[SPEAKER_01]: ask the ultimate question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we do with this plant when we
bring modern genomic tools together with
[SPEAKER_01]: the decades of knowledge that growers and
breeders already have?
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we can, and we really have to
answer some very basic research questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Answers to these basic questions will help
growers, breeders, and consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers can learn what they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this really sour diesel or something
else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers can begin to market their products
in particular ways so that if we learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about the genetic relationships between
cultivars, they can determine whether
[SPEAKER_01]: their cultivar is unique or if they wanna
market it more like they do for wine
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties where you have a terroir
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers can learn what their cultivars
are, as I said, related to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers, with some of the developments
that we're making, can say, I like Carla
[SPEAKER_01]: Quinn.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I get that again?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I make sure that I'm getting the
same thing over and over?
[SPEAKER_01]: And breeders, from the genomic tools that
we're developing and studying genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: variation, they can begin to learn what
variation exists with the cultivars that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the raw material for
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we can start to apply,
once we learn about the variation,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can start to apply modern genomic
breeding techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can learn how to select for pest
resistance and a robust stature for
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in different conditions that are
outside or in large greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've partnered with a few key academic
labs to help us answer some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about the biology and genetics
of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're taking three basic approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're characterizing the genetic variation
within cultivars to learn what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: variation we have to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're learning how different cultivars are
related to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, do all the cultivars that
have high CBD cluster together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they all related or do we see that
phenotype in multiple plates?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we can learn how drug cultivars
have drawn from natural populations around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to integrate all of this
information to develop modern genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to map the information to
determine whether there's variation for,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I mentioned before, pest resistance or
maybe drought tolerance so that breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: can produce plants that are strong,
hardy, and also have even new unique
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor or hematite profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do all the things that we want to
do, we need a solid genome assembly of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need that so that we can annotate what
genes are there and where they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can learn about different pathways,
the pathways that produce different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids or terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can compare those to model plants
like hops that has a genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can begin to develop linkage and
physical links that we can select for
[SPEAKER_01]: different traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are existing genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's at least one good existing
genome out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Pylus has decided to sequence another
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why would we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we learn a lot from looking,
from comparing both cultivars to each
[SPEAKER_01]: other, the whole genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can learn about what's called
structural variations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have large scale
rearrangements of the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can also learn about smaller scale
duplication and deletion of genes from one
[SPEAKER_01]: to many or removal of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One good example of this is copy number of
the THCA synthase and CBDA synthase genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that different copy numbers of
those are reflected in cultivars that
[SPEAKER_01]: produce high levels of CBD versus high
levels of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can learn about these pathways by
sequencing and understanding the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we trying to work with here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, plant genomes vary in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: This figure shows, it doesn't matter what
the numbers are so much, but it shows that
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, flowering plants in particular,
have a huge diversity of genome sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as a marker here, humans are kind
of like mid-range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arabidopsis, the model plant, is on the
smaller side.
[SPEAKER_01]: The human genome is about 20 times larger
than Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis and something like tomato are
sort of in between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The human genome is about four times
larger than the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually we're kind of lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these genomes that are really
large in plants have lots of repetitive
[SPEAKER_01]: elements and parts that are very difficult
to understand and assemble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, cannabis has 10 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the interesting things about
the biology of cannabis is that it has an
[SPEAKER_01]: XY sex determination system, just like
humans do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this makes a real difference in the
way that you might read for this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to other plants that often don't
have the chromosomal sex determination
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a sort of busy slide about
sequencing the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Page lab has done a phenomenal job
sequencing the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also have a re-sequencing
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've used what's called short read
sequencing, aluminum 454.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are short segments of DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sequenced very, very deeply into the
genome and have produced a great draft
[SPEAKER_01]: genome and are continuing to improve it
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We felt like we wanted to take a different
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still wanted to be able to compare the
genomes to each other, but we used a
[SPEAKER_01]: different sequencing approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used specific biosciences technology,
which produces these really long reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the advantage of that is that you can
much easier assemble the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take these long reads of
nucleotides and you can go together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the sequences are longer,
it's very easy to know where they belong
[SPEAKER_01]: with respect to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with less depth of sequencing,
we can get more of the genome assembled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're still working on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have greater depth of
sequencing and we want to try to cover as
[SPEAKER_01]: much of the genome as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is still a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even though we have just a draft
genome, we can start to compare cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do these things that I mentioned
previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do that, we've sampled cannabis
cultivars from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have covered over 40 countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have thousands of samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for most of the sequencing that we're
doing, we're focusing on a smaller subset
[SPEAKER_01]: of around 3,000 SNPs, or genetic variants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what have we found?
[SPEAKER_01]: One way to characterize genetic variation
is to ask how many sites in the genome are
[SPEAKER_01]: variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, this is the raw material that
we're going to be selecting for to pull
[SPEAKER_01]: different traits out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I put a few other species up here
as comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humans, you might say, inhabit this
shallow end of the gene variation pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of genetic variation to
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we're surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soy is similar, but that amame is
delicious already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grape has a fair amount of genetic
variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the grape industry, there's a lot
of concern over pathogens that are taking
[SPEAKER_01]: out some long-lived cultivars that are
really important in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have a lot of genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's hope that they can use these
modern breeding techniques to bring out
[SPEAKER_01]: new varieties as well as find genes for
pest resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grape is harder to breed because it's
long-lived.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes three years to get to maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're fortunate with cannabis being an
annual.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can move through breeding cycles
relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're fortunate because cannabis has a
lot of genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has variation that's somewhere between
grape and corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a lot of material for
genetic variation to select on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to compare corn and
cannabis a little bit because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: a poster child of breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corn has thousands of inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really different from cannabis
where you really have no inbred lines or
[SPEAKER_01]: not any widely used inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you take two inbred lines of
corn, it means that within one inbred
[SPEAKER_01]: line, there's relatively no genetic
variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you cross two together,
you get an odd screen that look exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: alike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the way that corn crosses are
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they look identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take two cannabis cultivars,
you get a variety of phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have different chemical profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That vary among the offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have different possibly colors,
statures, yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually kind of cool because
basement breeders have been allowed to use
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of crossing scheme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll cross, as you know,
pick phenotypes that they like and then
[SPEAKER_01]: clone them and make lots of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we can use modern molecular
breeding techniques, we can take much
[SPEAKER_01]: better advantage of the variation that
already exists in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can start to stack traits more
effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can have a robust plant that's
resistant to pests, smells like a dream
[SPEAKER_01]: and reduces anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit about the genetic
variation within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot overall on the population
level, but we also have a lot within each
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we wanted to understand how this
translates into population structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our modern drug cultivars, one distinct
group of cannabis that's out in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they related to hemp and other
land races?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we used an approach that looks at
population origins or ancestry,
[SPEAKER_01]: a program called structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a model based clustering
method that uses the genotype data to
[SPEAKER_01]: infer this population structure and assign
each individual that we sample to
[SPEAKER_01]: different populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an example for humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't cannabis, this is humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each color on here represents a
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are seven colors to represent
the seven population, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: supported populations of humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each vertical line on this figure is one
human.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a bar that's got some
orange, some red, and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: blue, it means that your heritage comes
from three different populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is similar to what you might see in a
23andMe kind of representation of your
[SPEAKER_01]: heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we applied this to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually have support for seven
populations in cannabis that are
[SPEAKER_01]: represented by these seven colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've named these by some well-known
cultivar names or phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just starting to get a sense of
really how these populations are,
[SPEAKER_01]: what cultivars compose these populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one on the left is OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got members that include OG Kush,
Whitefire, Platimoji, Pog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you look, there are,
of our thousands of samples, there are a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot that have Kush in their name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those often will have a large
component from this OG Kush population,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're also a mixture of a lot of
different populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that word in and of itself doesn't
necessarily mean that they're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: strictly composed of the OG Kush genetic
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have Skunk that includes Skunk
Number One, Jack Rare, Candy Jack,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Flash, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I thought was
kind of interesting is that Kim Dog and
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah Diesel have ancestry from OG Kush
and Skunk primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the high CBD group.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of a couple of areas where we
see high CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: This includes Kenatomic, ACDC,
Remedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the thing we're calling Berry,
which includes Berry White, Blackberry
[SPEAKER_01]: Pie, Black Dutty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the purples, where we have Purple
Kush, Purple Urkel, God's Gift,
[SPEAKER_01]: Vanetti Purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also sampled a huge number of what
we're terming land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not cultivated in a traditional
way like the drug cultivars, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: from throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a really good representation
from Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these African cultivars fall into this
land race group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a lot from South America and
Southeast Asia that also are comprised of
[SPEAKER_01]: this land race heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The final group, and I think that this is
not surprising based on other research,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that things that are traditionally
known as hemp really do fall out into a
[SPEAKER_01]: separate population group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have representatives from Russia,
Hungary, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Morocco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they fall out somewhat separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I thought was interesting
about the hemp group is that cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: like Harlequin, Seabracks, and Petal have
a pretty good amount of heritage from the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp group.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 20% of their genome is similar to
these hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this tells us a little bit about how
the current cannabis cultivars are
[SPEAKER_01]: structured.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we wanted to represent this in a way
that really compares all of the sample
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we developed this 3D representation of
our data that is what we're calling a
[SPEAKER_01]: phyllis galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is based on principle components
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of the dots that you see or nodes in
this image or in this movie is one sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're colored by those results from
the structure analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you remember the hems were green.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be green in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the lines that connect two nodes
together are yet another analysis that
[SPEAKER_01]: tries to infer relationships between
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which ones are parent-child
relationships or funnel relationships?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a significant number of samples
that appear to be genetically identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another image that shows you that
hemp group a little more clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had zoomed in a little bit more,
but there's Finola and the Kazakhstan
[SPEAKER_01]: samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other things that when people
submitted them to us, they term them hems.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shows the OG kush population.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw at first there were a lot of lines
between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of first degree
relationships within this cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: They aren't necessarily clones of each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a good representation of this
OG kush group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to talk about the names of
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants to know, do I have the real
Girl Scouting piece?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that question we're pretty far
from actually having a handle on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some type clusters of clones have very
consistent names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dream, which comprised I think 10% of
the market in Washington last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: some large percentage of the market,
actually does seem to form a nice tight
[SPEAKER_01]: cluster in our data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're getting Blue Dream at a
dispensary, it's very possible that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually what you think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you'll notice there are a few other
names scattered in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's likely that there was a plant
called Blue Dream that was cloned and then
[SPEAKER_01]: released to a lot of growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the converse of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you have one name and it's just
scattered throughout this galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a final example that I wanted
to show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned the purple group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these things you see here in
this pinkish purple are clones of each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see, hopefully, you can read
the names a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is every name in the book in this
clonal cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Grey Dye and Purple, which is
probably familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's Lavender, and Godsgift,
and Cool Push, and Boss GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, almost no name is repeated twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly we have a long way to go to
clarify what a cultivar name actually
[SPEAKER_01]: means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, I found out the other day
that there are 39,000 named cultivars that
[SPEAKER_01]: were sold in Washington last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to help growers, and breeders,
and consumers, we're developing the
[SPEAKER_01]: violence genotype test, which you can
purchase and send in a little piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: stem to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can put your star on this galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've made a fair amount of progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're characterizing the genetic variation
within the cultivars that we've looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're inferring family relationships,
how the different cultivars get to where
[SPEAKER_01]: they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're starting to work towards
developing modern genomic tools for
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the violence genotype test,
that's a first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really, I think, and we think,
a breeding revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis legalization is taking place all
over the US and the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really in parallel with this
scientific revolution that's transforming
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than just cannabis, every cultivated
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are using genomic sequence data to
breed for all major agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're using the genomic data to make
new plant varieties faster and more
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: More accurately than we ever had before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want this to be a part of the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're turning the tools that we're
developing into tests so that we can help
[SPEAKER_01]: other breeders with their programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeders can learn about the genetic
variation in their lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know about the relationships between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be developing
marker-assisted selection methods and
[SPEAKER_01]: using genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our goal really is to help breeders
bring new iterations of the classics that
[SPEAKER_01]: they've produced to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the end of this decade, breeders
will begin releasing new cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties that we haven't even dreamed of.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're entirely unlike the ones that we
have today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to thank you all for
listening and thank my team members at
[SPEAKER_01]: Filo's.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a small startup, so everyone in the
company has a role in the science that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just shown you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you.
