[SPEAKER_01]: It's 101.9 FM KVSH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our theme today has been altered states
and the reason for that or one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons for that is that we have Dr. Ethan
Russo here to talk with us about his
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis travel log.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, Dr. Russo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What inspired you to take off to Morocco
and story that fishermen would go out at
[SPEAKER_03]: night and they could see better their way
around because they would drink a cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: tincture beforehand and apparently he went
out with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: He couldn't see anything, but they were
maneuvering around the reefs and they
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't hit anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he reported this in Nature and I always
thought it was interesting and should be
[SPEAKER_03]: followed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Subsequently, some years later in a
journal in French, I saw an exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: similar report from Morocco and it's a
situation of the Moroccan fishermen,
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't know anything about the Jamaican
fishermen and at that point I decided that
[SPEAKER_03]: this really needed to be researched.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I contacted the lead author who was
Abdur Rahman Mirzouki who has joint
[SPEAKER_03]: professorships in Morocco and Spain and
said, let's try and study this
[SPEAKER_03]: scientifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Subsequently, a few months later,
I was going to Spain to Granada to serve
[SPEAKER_03]: on his thesis committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next year in 2002, we had arranged an
expedition.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found some equipment that could test
night vision and so we could test before
[SPEAKER_03]: and after to see if cannabis did produce
an improvement and that proved to be the
[SPEAKER_03]: case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So subsequently we were able to publish
that and had quite an adventure in Morocco
[SPEAKER_03]: in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you saying that driving at night is
improved if you're high?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as with many things, there could be
pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone's too high, they get distracted
and they tend to drive too slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's different than alcohol where
people take risks and overestimate their
[SPEAKER_03]: abilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, we established that the
dose of cannabis that's required to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually improve night vision is pretty
high and in other words, the person who's
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to pursue that improved vision may
be high at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's unlike some medical effects of
cannabis where clearly you can get
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement in pain without the need to be
inebriated or have a psychoactive effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you explain to our listeners the
differences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that can be confusing for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different properties of cannabis
that serve different purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain a little bit about those?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's THC and I'm not sure what the
other is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So THC is the main psychoactive ingredient
in cannabis but by no means the only one
[SPEAKER_03]: that's active pharmacologically.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the one that people know the most
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past, a lot of people relegated the
benefits of cannabis to the idea that
[SPEAKER_03]: people were high and they just felt
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feeling better is the idea of medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: To my understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But beyond that, it's been established
with modern clinical trials that one can
[SPEAKER_03]: have benefits on symptoms like pain,
muscle tightness, nausea even without the
[SPEAKER_03]: need of having an altered state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is in contra distinction to your
theme today.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, in other words, there may be a
sweet spot particularly with certain kinds
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis where one can have the benefit
of symptom reduction without impairment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that for instance, if someone had a
chronic medical condition, needed cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: for it, they could still work or study
effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what, excuse me, what is the property
in cannabis other than THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to remember the name of it,
that's why I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cannabidiol perhaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, there are many other components.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis has over 500 compounds in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that are best known are THC
tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another that's really come to the fore in
the last few years is cannabidiol or CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD, that was what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD is quite distinct from THC in that
it's non-intoxicating, tends to produce an
[SPEAKER_03]: alertness rather than sleepiness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, it's a strong
anticonvulsant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an anti-psychotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much THC alone can make people feel
crazy or paranoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's counteracted by cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what would be beneficial for
cancer patients who are undergoing
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, actually both are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously with THC, it's rate limited by
the psychoactivity and one needs very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very high doses of cannabinoids to
primarily treat cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: With CBD, you don't have the psychoactive
side effect of a problem and so high doses
[SPEAKER_03]: are attainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But generally speaking, for most kinds of
tumors, both are helpful and a combination
[SPEAKER_03]: may be best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you saying that that part of
cannabis can actually treat cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just the symptoms?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and what's unique about the
cannabinoids in treating cancer is they
[SPEAKER_03]: are toxic to the cancer cells while being
preserved for the normal cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is quite in contradistinction to
conventional chemotherapy where they're
[SPEAKER_03]: toxic for all cells and this is why people
who are undergoing treatment for cancer
[SPEAKER_03]: may lose their hair and slough their gut
lining because of this general toxicity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the approach there is try to kill the
tumor before you kill the patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: With cannabinoids, we're actually trying
to kill the tumor and keep the other cells
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are all these side benefits
because both THC and CBD treat the nausea
[SPEAKER_03]: that's associated with cancer and with
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They simultaneously treat pain,
improve sleep, and so there are all these
[SPEAKER_03]: side benefits, if you will, to this kind
of treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why hasn't Western medicine embraced
this treatment for cancer with both arms?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid it's a political issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: People form moral judgments on what should
be a medical and scientific decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, other nations are more advanced
than we are in their attitudes about this
[SPEAKER_03]: and I hope that will change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to be honest, I'm not optimistic
right this moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be making a presentation
at the Vashon Theater tomorrow night,
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday, January 19th.
[SPEAKER_01]: About your trip through your travelogue
through Morocco and China.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to be telling folks
that you learned?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it beyond the issue of night vision
improvement?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a little bit of
scientific aspect like we just discussed
[SPEAKER_03]: with the night vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: But additionally, there'll be some nice
photographs and stories, hopefully a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of humor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I hope it'll be entertaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: And educational for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to mention, in China, in Xinjiang,
which is in the far west, very remote
[SPEAKER_03]: area, what happened with that was I was in
Arlington, Virginia and a friend called me
[SPEAKER_03]: to say, you've got to look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an advanced online version of
this article saying that they'd found the
[SPEAKER_03]: grave of this shaman in Xinjiang along
with a huge amount of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were able to identify it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was fascinated, but what I noticed
immediately was they didn't have a
[SPEAKER_03]: chemical analysis of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought this needed to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I immediately contacted my boss to see if
this is something that we could study.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I contacted the lead author,
Professor Li Cheng-sen, to see if he'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in collaboration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this all came together within about 20
minutes, which is miraculous because
[SPEAKER_03]: normally these are both people that are
hard to reach.
[SPEAKER_03]: But over the course of the next two years,
we went through 11 months of bureaucracy
[SPEAKER_03]: to get some of the cannabis from China to
England where we did the analyses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was so well preserved that we not
only did chemical analyses that proved
[SPEAKER_03]: that this was a drug strain of cannabis
and not one that was likely used for
[SPEAKER_03]: fabric like hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, the state of preservation
was such that we were able to do a genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: analysis of it, again, showing that it was
a drug strain and that this would have
[SPEAKER_03]: been used for medical purposes or for
properties of divination by the shaman.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was able to go to Xinjiang and
do a field study with our team over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Redig the tomb, establish some parameters,
and again, have a lot of adventures
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking on the morning scramble with
Dr. Ethan Russo, who will be presenting
[SPEAKER_01]: his cannabis travelogue tomorrow night at
the Vashon Theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: What time?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is at 730.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'll probably talk for about 70
minutes, and we'll leave about 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_03]: for questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was it preserved?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the method of preservation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it just airtight?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the grave ultimately was likely
airtight.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an area that's extremely arid,
and it's a cool desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of the extended Gobi Desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, the conditions there are
very alkaline.
[SPEAKER_03]: So between those things, the coolness,
the alkaline nature of things,
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis was extremely well preserved,
and there was an air chamber in the tomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be able to show pictures of all of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it was very scientific.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason we had to redig the tomb was I
wanted to take the temperature down there
[SPEAKER_03]: and show that it was cool enough to aid in
the preservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where could people read more about this in
preparation for tomorrow night?
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to look up a few things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they'd be welcome to email me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my name, Ethan Russo,
E-T-H-A-N-R-U-S-S-O at comcast.net.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of these studies about the
expeditions were published, and so it'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: easiest for them to email me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll send them the articles, but I hope
that they'd come anyway so they can see
[SPEAKER_03]: the pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it sounds fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am fascinated by the whole idea of a
Chinese shaman using it, and how old did
[SPEAKER_01]: you say this tomb was?
[SPEAKER_03]: The ultimate radiocarbon dating was 2,700
years old, and I would just add that this
[SPEAKER_03]: fellow apparently wasn't ethnic Chinese.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a member of what the Chinese called
the Gu-She tribe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this was a Caucasian individual,
probably a speaker of an extinct language
[SPEAKER_03]: called Tocharian, which most closely
resembles the Celtic languages.
[SPEAKER_03]: In their clothing, they wore tartans.
[SPEAKER_03]: These were nomads of the desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was only at that time that the Chinese
were actually first having contact with
[SPEAKER_03]: these visitors from the West, as it were.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking Irish, kilt-wearing,
crazy guys going to China and teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: them about cannabis and how to reach God,
or whatever, the divine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or for a remedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Chinese had a tradition of their
own of using cannabis, but we don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: much about what the exchange of ideas was,
but eventually that came to pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing to me that you found out as
much as you have, through the carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: dating and the DNA of the origins of this
individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ethan Russo, you are a Vashon Island
resident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud to say I'm coming up on my 10th
anniversary here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your presentation tomorrow night is
sponsored by a couple of Vashon Island
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hand it over to Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shango Los, welcome to our studio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to tell us about who benefits
from tomorrow night's presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I want to let you know that
the doors are actually open at 7.30.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presentation is from 8 until 9.30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tickets are only $5, which is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculously low to see someone as
esteemed as Dr. Russo, but we wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it available to everybody,
because this is interesting information to
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the event itself is sponsored by two
of the island's licensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: producers, Vashon Velvet and Vashon Island
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also being sponsored by the Vashon
Island Marijuana Enthusiasts Alliance,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we've talked about on your program
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the V-M-E-A?
[SPEAKER_00]: V-M-E-A.
[SPEAKER_00]: V-M-E-A, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good memory, Jan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot the I.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you both for joining us
this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Russo, this is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you like to leave our listeners
with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just hopefully that they'd have an open
mind about the medical possibilities for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I hope that people would be able to
make the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn a little bit more and hopefully be
entertained for the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you go, the medical prospects of
cannabis are intriguing and, to my mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: important for us to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can people access this if it's not
currently accepted by Western medicine or
[SPEAKER_01]: even legal in some cases?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so confused about the cannabis laws in
the state right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in Washington state for access.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many other places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is an evolving situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just encourage people to read as
much as they can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get involved politically if they wish to
advance this agenda for the availability
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis for medical usage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just encourage them to try to
pursue that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that vein, are there any online media
information sites that you could steer
[SPEAKER_02]: people towards?
[SPEAKER_02]: To get some general information about what
we could do here in this state and what's
[SPEAKER_02]: available?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many that come to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can provide those to us and
we'll make them available.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to send me an email with that
information, we'll put it up on the Voice
[SPEAKER_01]: of Eshon website.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or go to ethanrusso.comcast.net.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if people would like the articles
in advance of the presentation,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be happy to send those.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm curious about one more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are an MD in Western medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it you continue to be funded to do
these kinds of research explorations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, funding has been a real issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: My prior employment with GW
Pharmaceuticals, this was the only
[SPEAKER_03]: independent research project that I was
able to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: During my 11 years there full-time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how I got into this is, yeah,
I was trained in a traditional fashion in
[SPEAKER_03]: Western medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after seven years in practice,
it occurred to me that I was using
[SPEAKER_03]: increasingly toxic drugs on my patients
with less and less benefit, which led me
[SPEAKER_03]: back to an old interest in herbal
medicine, which I gradually incorporated
[SPEAKER_03]: into my practice based on scientific
practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, that included cannabis,
which is probably the herbal remedy par
[SPEAKER_03]: excellence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we could talk about this for days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you'll come back and visit us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be happy to any time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just live down the street.
Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 843 on KVSH.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Wednesday morning scramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking with Dr. Ethan Russo
and with Tango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Russo is going to be presenting his
cannabis travel log using cannabis to see
[SPEAKER_01]: in the dark in Morocco and exhuming a
cannabis shaman in China.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is better than TV.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's better than TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tomorrow night at 7.30 at the Vashon
Theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Susan McCabe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Wednesday morning scramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with my wonderful billing
co-host, Jan Laughlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
