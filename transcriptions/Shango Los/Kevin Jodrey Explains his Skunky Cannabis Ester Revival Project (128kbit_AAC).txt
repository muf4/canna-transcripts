[SPEAKER_00]: You want me to talk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, talk me through it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna create a timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a skunk from 1981.
[SPEAKER_00]: I received it from an individual who had
it in a library and it had gone into
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering from stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I wanted to show the vid
was I wanted to just show the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's, Christ, it's ancient,
and to show that the EarthBox technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's wonderful for recovering older
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you set this up, the plant
basically balances out in its biology and
[SPEAKER_00]: its uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It normals out in the way it grows
morphologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from here, the cuttings are beautiful
to start working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that occurred back in the 80s
and all through the 90s forward was we had
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we went into indoor cultivation,
we had problems controlling the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, we got rid of a lot of
these cannabis varieties that are
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptionally unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is, is that we're trying
to assume that it was terpenes only that
[SPEAKER_00]: made those smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, we're starting to understand
now that it was esters, plant alcohols,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those are unique to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't really breed and
reproduce some of these odors with the
[SPEAKER_00]: modern varieties because they're not
carrying these esters forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just turps alone that make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes and trends change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was popular in the 80s was not
popular in the 90s, and then subsequently
[SPEAKER_00]: was repopulated in the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The direction that it was taken makes it
sometimes difficult to go back to a
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we were seeking only fruity,
floral scents, scents for years,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it would be very difficult now to go
find these heavily burnt fuel rubber
[SPEAKER_00]: scents of the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why these are these older
plants are so important that we can use
[SPEAKER_00]: them to bring us back into a range of
genetics that reflect more what occurred
[SPEAKER_00]: at that time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now we can make the decisions as
to what's really attractive currently
[SPEAKER_00]: today using that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these older varieties are crucial
in cannabis for what we do because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no way to get back into what was trendy in
the past, what was really the foundation
[SPEAKER_00]: of the modern cannabis lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times we realize that we went
in the wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hopefully I can tap into this and
see many, many, many different directions
[SPEAKER_00]: to go in flavor and chemo type in terms of
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully we're able to find some of
those rare alcohol esters that create some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these unbelievably pungent,
funky smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why you knew a skunk was a
skunk was it was because it was an ester.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost instantly volatized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had instantaneous aroma through the
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was exceptionally difficult to capture
it because it's bonded so lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what we want now is these
incredibly loud, bright, explosive
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The signature isn't an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're legally growing it in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we work within our boundaries,
these kind of cannabis varieties are the
[SPEAKER_00]: new market.
[SPEAKER_00]: This 81, I have one from the 90s,
the Hog's Breath, and then a Grass Valley
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk that I picked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through those four female progenitors and
then the male skunks that I'm sifting
[SPEAKER_00]: through now to go into it, hopefully over
the next couple of years, we'll really be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to start to pull out some of the
stuff from the past that really got most
[SPEAKER_00]: of us into cannabis and give us a lot more
choices and options than what we have
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if we should draw it out there
just to have visuals so we're not just
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing you just continuously talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think having the map would be clutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this timeline gives you a reflection
of from 1968 to 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 68 was basically when you started to
have the huge influx of the back to land
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, the reclamation people in the
Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 81, we had a full blown outdoor
situation that was unparalleled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the reputation of Humboldt
was really built.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 1983, this is Camp, and it radically
changed cannabis from this point forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this point forward, we went into
cannabis that was no longer so attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more of a stealth type cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we went forward this time,
10, 20, 30 plus years, 35 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we changed what cannabis was from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I breathe something from this
point or say from here, these ripples
[SPEAKER_00]: reflect my populations, potential
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order for me to get back all the
way into the past of these varieties here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to actually find a plant from the
past to bring this ripple or I have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a population so big, you know,
20,000, 30,000 plants of this size so that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can find here or it's just easy to find
the plant and go here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have two choices, bigger populations
or go back in time to find the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: were taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what people realize is when you have a
line and we take the XY and we cross and
[SPEAKER_00]: we do our F1, we have many potential
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go in any of these directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In skunks, we went this way with the more
floral and fruity, lower smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower ester.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to go back down this line and
go across the board and start to pull out
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these things that were so
unbelievably attractive in my memory and
[SPEAKER_00]: then resurrect them this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the whole point of this skunk
project is to come back out of the floral
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits and go back in time enough to get
the gene pool so we can F2, F3,
[SPEAKER_00]: F4 and try to get it into a more stable
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we have the ability to do
this outside once again, really what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing is I'm replicating 1968 to 1981.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm going to do.
