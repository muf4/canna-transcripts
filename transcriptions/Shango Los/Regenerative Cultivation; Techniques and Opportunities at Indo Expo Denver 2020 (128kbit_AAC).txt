[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody and welcome to the 1230
panel presentation, regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation techniques and opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please silence your cell phones if you
haven't already done so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Shango Los, host of the Shaping Fire
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like listening to smart interviews
with the top minds and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to check out the show at
shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an extraordinary YouTube
channel with over 150 speaker videos I've
[SPEAKER_00]: recorded at events just like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Colin Bell, one of our speakers,
already appears on the channel several
[SPEAKER_00]: times teaching about various aspects of
microbes and microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we're going to introduce our
panelists starting from the far end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin Bell is co-founder of Grosentia and
co-inventor of their flagship product,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth Pea from mammoth microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin completed his PhD in soil microbial
ecology in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a research scientist at Colorado State
University, Colin published dozens of
[SPEAKER_00]: peer-reviewed publications that were
focused on microbial mediated processes
[SPEAKER_00]: that enhance plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin left his academic position at
Colorado State University in March 2015 to
[SPEAKER_00]: launch Grosentia.
[SPEAKER_00]: To his side is Jacob Paulitzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the co-founder and director of
Science and Strategy of the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Conservancy, a sustainable cannabis
standards development and certification
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jacob is also the co-founder and board
chair of Sun and Earth Certified,
[SPEAKER_00]: a regenerative cannabis and hemp
certification nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a member of Denver's Department of
Public Health and Environment's Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Sustainability Work Group and the National
Cannabis Industry Association's Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation Committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to his right is John Paul Maxfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the founder and CEO of Waste
Farmers, a company developing people,
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses, and brands who transform
emerging social environmental needs into
[SPEAKER_00]: market-based opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Paul also leads Batch 64,
a cannabis cultivation solutions partner
[SPEAKER_00]: that provides a unified platform for
premium responsibly sourced growing media
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant nutrition, allowing the world's
leading cannabis producers to scale
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently and consciously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, JP is one of Denver Business
Journal's top 40 under 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please welcome our panelists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the speakers asked me, they want to
make sure that they design their answers
[SPEAKER_00]: most appropriate for the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give you four categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see yourself in this category,
raise your hand if you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a cultivator, raise your
hand, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you are a dispensary owner or
employee, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you are a manufacturer,
all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a general idea, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this question, we're going to start
with Colin on the far end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jacob and John Paul can jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colin, regenerative cannabis
agriculture is increasing in popularity
[SPEAKER_00]: and importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the range of ways to practice it in
commercial cultivation is pretty huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is an example of a regenerative
practice that is easy to get into that has
[SPEAKER_00]: real benefits within a year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, everyone, for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep it pretty simple and
then keep it with my expertise on the
[SPEAKER_01]: science side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regenerate to replace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regenerative cells is biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We replace our cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We regrow our cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in farming, it's about making sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think about this in terms of
sustainability also.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're giving more than we take away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think about when I think
about regenerative practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as I think about regenerative
agriculture, I think about carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And carbon is the currency of all life on
earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's definitely the currency of soil
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem that we have in
agriculture, in general agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that we're taking carbon out of the
system as we break it up, as we till it,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we farm it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're losing soil organic matter,
soil organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that holds everything for soil
fertility, nutrient holding capacity,
[SPEAKER_01]: water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to answer that question,
what I think about when I think about
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative agriculture as one simple
thing that you can do is think about the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you adding more carbon into your
soil, into your substrate, than you are
[SPEAKER_01]: taking away?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do that through a lot of
different means.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's biochar as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to preface that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about how you're getting it on the
back end too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, thinking about where all your
inputs are originating from is a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: regeneration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a big picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think about it in terms of how
you can maintain your soil, you can add as
[SPEAKER_01]: little as possible, you really have to
start with thinking about the carbon in
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a pretty big topic,
but that's where I'm going to leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jacob, same thing to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's an example of regenerative
practice that's easy to get into and has
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits within a year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I would say from a cultivation
point of view practices, simple ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: mulching.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really trying to build and support
the soil health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that comes with not having good soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mulching is a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also planting beneficial insectaries on
your edges or in between rows,
[SPEAKER_02]: companion planting, cover cropping,
crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Producing tillage is a whole lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on if you're starting where you
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But simple things and kind of also just
it's helpful to take a step back to where
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to be and then how to do that
with the resources you have on hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess the goal is to really try to
improve your, you know, onsite soil
[SPEAKER_02]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So try to tackle one thing, plant some
comfrey, plant some chamomile,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, different things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll like slowly help to either,
you know, improve your soil quality and
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient content or else it would reduce
your, you know, IPM needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And try to, you know, bring nature into
your grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's you, John Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: This question scares the hell out of me
and I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because it talks about, and I'm going
to sound like a permaculturalist and
[SPEAKER_04]: permaculturalists tend to sound like
assholes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't mean to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, you know, we're talking about,
you know, thinking about holes and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about thinking about systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we're talking about now is sort
of best practices, which is a base layer
[SPEAKER_04]: of regenerative thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think the best return in a year
is to start with, you know, essence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Essence is something that is, you know,
the idea that no two snowflakes look
[SPEAKER_04]: alike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start with essence of self.
[SPEAKER_04]: Essence of the property that, or,
you know, the place that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really get to understand that at a
deep level.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is the place to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the things that we're discussing now,
these best practices are sort of the
[SPEAKER_04]: functional layers of kind of the one
foundational layer of regenerative as a
[SPEAKER_04]: practice applied to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this question we're going to start
with you, Jacob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then John Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Colin will jump in again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since some of the biggest advantages of
regenerative agriculture take some time to
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the first question was just about
the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the cool stuff about
regeneratives, you know, is five and ten
[SPEAKER_00]: years out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since some of the biggest advantages of
regenerative agriculture take some time to
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve, let's talk about the things we can
do for the future but take action now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jacob, what is a regenerative strategy
or series of techniques that take some
[SPEAKER_00]: effort now but result in an outsized
advantage down the line?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I was thinking about this and
wanted to kind of come up with a
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to use this opportunity now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess from the cultivation side,
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having something that's specific to your
site that's going to thrive in your
[SPEAKER_02]: specific microclimate and deal with the
pests that you have and be able to uptake
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and survive, you know,
the temperature swings and different
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not everyone is ready to start doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, you know, seed sharing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sharing networks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to kind of talk about
supporting farmers and supporting your
[SPEAKER_02]: workers and, you know, creating a healthy,
positive, fulfilling work environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: which comes in from like your recruiting,
giving people opportunities, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: across the spectrum to, you know,
bring in some more farmers and promote it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if you're looking at like
what's going to pay dividends long term is
[SPEAKER_02]: building that network and, you know,
teaching people how to grow, learning,
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing knowledge, you know, like we're in
a situation now, especially if you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: small farmer, you're a homesteader,
you know, there's big corporations coming
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to band together and support each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only way we're all going to
survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think building those networks and
taking that opportunity and that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that comes into how do we
compensate workers?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's financial competition,
but I think there's also a lot of other
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see if you're a generative
farmer, you should be growing more than
[SPEAKER_02]: just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you shouldn't be monoculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you should be supporting CSAs or
at least providing food to your workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's providing, you know,
that kind of fostering of an environment
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, respecting the mutual
appreciation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're helping a farmer, a farmer's
helping you or a worker, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the community in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what's really going to
see dividends in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rather than siloing us and thinking
like, oh, I have a secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my IP.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my, you know, edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're all trying to do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes to regenerative,
it's a big path, you know, forward and
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone adds a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all learning from each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's kind of building that
context rather than a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural thing that we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John Paul, this is more of a
permaculture timeline question,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's something that can be done now
that the benefits we'll see are
[SPEAKER_00]: significant about five or 10 years out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how many of you are going outdoors?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of all the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, you know, specifically for
you, I think on that baseline is soil
[SPEAKER_04]: health first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think soil health has, you know,
applications to reduced inputs and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, lower input cost, but also
building soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we're able to develop a market for
carbon, the potential for monetizing
[SPEAKER_04]: ecosystem services, monetizing you know,
carbon credits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think from that base level,
soil health is number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And investments, you know, whether it's
soil carbon or microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, you know, the world of
microbes, we're just, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you understand it, you know, more than
most in the world, but I think we're just
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning to understand the true
potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, but at a very base level
for outdoor growers, it's soil health,
[SPEAKER_04]: soil health, soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I really like what everyone's
sharing here and from the essence of the
[SPEAKER_01]: first conversation all the way down to the
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm hearing is, is honestly,
it depends on who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on where you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think ultimately farmers and farmers
that grow organically in any kind of crop
[SPEAKER_01]: understand you're not growing plants,
you're growing soil and soils growing
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you got to focus on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a long time to turn soil from
a degraded soil to a soil that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: can sustain life on its own with minimal
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that timeline is critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking decades in some cases,
in extreme cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say on a broader level,
do you have a plan and do you have a goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have the vision,
that destination, that's where you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: start, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be different depending
on the essence of your property and where
[SPEAKER_01]: you are geographically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have to capture the water some
places you do some places?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a major priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil is always going to be important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of inputs is always going to be
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your culture on your farm and the people
that you surround yourself with,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's sustainable living as far as I'm
concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you want to be around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you want to live this life with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all these details are critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there's a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a destination.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have got to understand what that is
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have ways to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have these series of tactics
that are steps along your journey to make
[SPEAKER_01]: it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regenerative agriculture isn't a,
hey, I'm going to do that this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, this is how I'm going to live
my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll always progress year after year
probably for your whole life to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to improve those types of practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more you can turn your crop to a
sustainable level of regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture, you're going to see benefits
not only economically from how you're
[SPEAKER_01]: living, but the quality of crops that
you're growing can improve substantially
[SPEAKER_01]: through more organic lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we all know that if we've
tried, we've seen some of the end products
[SPEAKER_01]: from that type of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great transition, Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pass it down to JP here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because a lot of us have got
regenerative agriculture in our heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to help the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want the runoff from our property
to be causing damage on our neighbors'
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, margins are tight in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes regenerative agriculture is
considered to be, you know, time consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: and laborious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to buy inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's just easier to buy a
bottle of something on the shelf and go
[SPEAKER_00]: with that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's surprising how financially smart
doing regenerative agriculture can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with you, we'll start with you on this
one, John Paul, and then Jacob,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to many folks, regenerative practices
appear expensive in the short term in
[SPEAKER_00]: time, labor, and sometimes inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those of us who are further down the
regenerative path know that regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: actually saves money and increases yields
both now and over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So JP, please describe a way that you've
seen regenerative practices directly
[SPEAKER_00]: impact the bottom line and create
increased revenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I think I can apply it,
I think, to our own company.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a regenerative company and do work
with Carol Samford, who's a really great
[SPEAKER_04]: thinker on regenerative as applied to
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you can translate that to
agriculture as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you haven't seen her work,
I would highly recommend looking into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the idea, again, starting with
essence, understanding our essence as a
[SPEAKER_04]: company, which, you know, fortunately or
unfortunately tends to stem from the
[SPEAKER_04]: founder, depending on who it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, and then really why that's important
is because in a marketplace, no one,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, if essence is unique and innate,
no one can copy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you understand that, then it makes you,
you know, not as placeable in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it's consideration for what we call
our stakeholders in traditional business
[SPEAKER_04]: or say in agriculture, you know,
it's tended to be pretty myopic.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a multi-stakeholder approach where
we talk about our customers, our
[SPEAKER_04]: co-creators, which is, you know,
the folks that work with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then supply chain, community,
the earth, and then also investors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do we add value?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you talked about things in balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that another term in terms of
regeneration is reciprocity in the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it really is about the critical
reason I pointed to question number one in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of like, what are these best
practices that we can get to a return in a
[SPEAKER_04]: year is because there's no, best practice
that you can just adopt that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: what might work for another might,
you know, not work for you, might not work
[SPEAKER_04]: for the property that you're on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's an old saying of like,
you know, you could take the engine of
[SPEAKER_04]: like a Mercedes and a BMW, I don't know
what car, four BMW.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if you took the best pieces
of those and then put those together in
[SPEAKER_04]: another engine, it wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's about the, you know,
it's about the whole, it's about the
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for us, understanding not only our
essence, but then the essence of our
[SPEAKER_04]: customers, which is unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we work with multi-state operators
who want to grow and want standardized
[SPEAKER_04]: operating procedures.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you guys know, like every grow is
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every groom within a grow can be
different, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're talking indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to apply best practices to that,
it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so seeing customers from the essence
of what they want to achieve has opened up
[SPEAKER_04]: a great deal of, you know, ability for us
to help make their lives better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from a farming perspective,
you know, again, starting with yourself in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of the essence of what you want to
achieve, what the land is able to achieve
[SPEAKER_04]: and getting to know your end customers and
their lives and what they want to achieve,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, really helps to improve the value
and that exchange of value, that
[SPEAKER_04]: reciprocity across the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to say kind of when you said
SOBs, kind of triggered something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say from my answer to this
question on where to find, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: returns on this being, you know,
getting certified, which kind of comes
[SPEAKER_02]: into documentation, record keeping,
writing down what you're doing for a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: suite of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one is, you know, you should be
planning before the season, figuring out
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on in that season,
what worked, what didn't work,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that you can refer back to it and build
your own farmer's almanac.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then also, you know, to have a genuine
interaction with the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumers are hungry for buying,
you know, cannabis hemp that is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, aligned with their values.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they now have access to
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're entitled to information.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, smart consumers, I mean,
we all want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're starting to ask for,
you know, certified products.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is still a lot of greenwashing in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so through Sun Ernst Certified and the
Cannabis Conservancy, we're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, simply sort of I think that we
work with distributors, brands,
[SPEAKER_02]: buyers for regenerative farms,
sustainable farms, to try to guarantee
[SPEAKER_02]: them, you know, premiums on their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, what I would like to
see is all of the certifications working
[SPEAKER_02]: together to have a organic, you know,
certified shelf in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a big thing is,
you know, putting our, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: our money where our mouth is, but like
opening on Murgro's and with the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was thinking about this the
other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a lot like the winery industry on
some level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a million wines out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I like wine, but like I can
tell, you know, the differences between
[SPEAKER_02]: all these different, you know,
Murgro's or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, if I go to a winery,
then I kind of have that connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I go to a farm, I'm more likely to
have loyalty to that farm, to want that
[SPEAKER_02]: farm, to understand how it was grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, having that
connection, which the kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: certification does, but then also,
you know, just different partnerships that
[SPEAKER_02]: we can have with, you know, butt tenders
and the dispensary of as best as possible,
[SPEAKER_02]: showing the consumer where and how and who
is growing their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what really pays dividends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with different sheets, you know,
regenerative farms from every other farm
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I think that's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what I'd add to what's been
shared is, you know, we're talking about a
[SPEAKER_01]: what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also talking about this how.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've identified that how is
different depending on who you are,
[SPEAKER_01]: what your farm looks like, the needs that
you have to get to this what.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, this is also about a why.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at the end of the day,
we are people and we're all driven by a
[SPEAKER_01]: why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I am in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we started a organic microbial
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Company from the university because we're
bringing nature to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I've been thinking about
for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realize that my fundamental
scientific training could be applied to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring value to farmers and help me realize
and live my why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to prosper.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be able to live in abundance as
business owners, as growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also and I'll tell you what I think
is the value is our why.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can reach this destination,
but we live our whole life in a journey
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll hit our goals as people who are
trying to get to a destination.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can walk in a straight line and get
places and our whole lives are in that
[SPEAKER_01]: walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this is how you want to live your
life, this is how you want to manage your
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's way more valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than maybe getting as a extreme example,
a little more yield by pouring a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: salt and not giving a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this means things to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it means stuff to you, it enriches
your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, you're not
going to think about that extra pound per
[SPEAKER_01]: crop that you developed by using the salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to think about how you live
your life the way you wanted to live your
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you developed your farm and you built
your soil and it meant something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's there after you're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, that's what we should be
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Focusing on a why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, this topic is all about the
why.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it means something and it
drives us all up on this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it drives a lot of you in that
audience also.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it's not your why,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires extra work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires a whole different level of
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a different lifestyle for many,
many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't have it any other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I deal with them all the time
and I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the value can go way beyond that extra
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're talking about money,
you know, you're talking to the wrong guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You care less about a dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I care about the way I live my life and I
care about a why that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're allowed to have one more why,
but this is a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a special thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: To follow and I think it's more gratifying
and more rewarding than anything I'll ever
[SPEAKER_01]: look at in my bank account.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't mean you have to
sacrifice the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a trade-offs that you want to
look at as a business also.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things that he didn't
mention, my grandfather was nominated as
[SPEAKER_04]: the agricultural citizen of the century in
Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the things that he helped
pioneer were some of the things we're
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to move beyond with regard to
regenerative ag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason that I'm sort of harping on
this idea of like you can't, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: take best practices and apply it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without some understanding of like a
baseline of essence, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what industrial agriculture
was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really like, how do we take this
method of what we're doing and apply it
[SPEAKER_04]: across any landscape?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll flatten it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll remove trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do all those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're living with the repercussions of
that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But for farmers, you know, one of the
things you mentioned, the challenge with
[SPEAKER_04]: these things, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: With regenerative organic and these
standards and typically with consumer
[SPEAKER_04]: demands that we're putting the risk of
these things on the most vulnerable,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is the farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think part of, in terms of the
long-term horizon, from my perspective,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have undervalued assets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those undervalued assets are land that
we have sort of looked at really
[SPEAKER_04]: extractively, like what can we take out of
it?
[SPEAKER_04]: But where we are with climate,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we need to do to slow or maintain
a climate that is habitable for people is
[SPEAKER_04]: remove carbon from the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a $6 trillion opportunity,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So while hemp and cannabis might seem like
a huge market, it pales in comparison to
[SPEAKER_04]: the market of what carbon will be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in terms of how that frames how you
manage today for tomorrow, I firmly
[SPEAKER_04]: believe that the value of carbon in the
next decade, hopefully sooner,
[SPEAKER_04]: will be realized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the practices and these regenerative
practices will be something that returns
[SPEAKER_04]: the value of balance back to farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that the only way to change
a system is sort of within a system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the system we got is capitalism.
[SPEAKER_04]: The system we got is what we're dealing
with today.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think there's a huge opportunity,
a $6 trillion opportunity to manage,
[SPEAKER_04]: or that's a poor word, but to bring
systems back into balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the value of carbon in the
soil is going to be an enormous,
[SPEAKER_04]: enormous opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think farmers are positioned very
well who start working towards that today
[SPEAKER_04]: to benefit from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in so doing, benefit the people they
work with, benefit the communities where
[SPEAKER_04]: they grow, benefit the ecosystem,
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on to the mic there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I want to add to that is so
if you're in the room and you're thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about going into regenerative agriculture,
and like none of the three guys really
[SPEAKER_00]: said, you're going to make more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me be that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're finding with regenerative
agriculture is when you use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're creating higher yielding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spend less money fighting pests
because the plants are stronger and they
[SPEAKER_00]: take care of the pest resistance
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a marketing advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people want to buy products that
are aligned with their value.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value of your property increases
because you're not dumping salt-based
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Colin was saying when he brought
out his philosopher scientists,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just feel better about life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're talking with your business
partners and you've got to convince them
[SPEAKER_00]: to go regenerative, there is a lot of
evidence out there that shows that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually make more money going with
regenerative techniques than you can by
[SPEAKER_00]: using other techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so with that, we're going to
move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing well on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to ask you guys one
more question that I didn't let you know
[SPEAKER_00]: about in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will have time for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after this question, I will come out to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of get your question in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a good 10 minutes for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, one of the things that's
interesting about regenerative is how we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to balance the competitiveness
because we need to make sure that we're in
[SPEAKER_00]: the market and we can sell our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we're not
competitive because we're all trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make regenerative cannabis agriculture a
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want there to be more of it,
both for just the quality of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: human life, but also because we want it to
replace traditional industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural practices, which could
totally take over cannabis if we
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative people don't do something
about it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my question that I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start with JP and head down the line
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in trying to balance the
competitiveness because we want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure our products are sold, but also we
also need to work together in community as
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative folk and family, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give one example that people can use to
create some kind of partnership or
[SPEAKER_00]: community with people who have other
farmers who are essentially their
[SPEAKER_00]: competitors in the marketplace,
but actually are all part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you might have similar
experiences with both of you, but I think
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis industry is one where there
is this notion of protecting information,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it doesn't exist in other sectors of
agriculture to the extent that it does in
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think what you're missing is a
knowledge that can be shared, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And also just support.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the truth is, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people that can understand best
how hard it is are the people doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so on an emotional level, it's
beneficial, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there are lessons, there are bits
of knowledge that can be shared.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were talking about sort of putting
together a group of cultivators to just
[SPEAKER_04]: get together, not try to sell shit,
but just get together and just talk and
[SPEAKER_04]: share.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think a lot of growers feel
pretty isolated is what we understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a shame because what that leads
to is really great people deciding not to
[SPEAKER_04]: continue forward, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think there needs to be more,
and I think there's a dearth of community
[SPEAKER_04]: beyond sort of service level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know from a CEO perspective,
which is pretty much what most cultivators
[SPEAKER_04]: are as sort of the CEO, it's a very
isolating activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're sort of solo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that a community of people who
can understand and go beyond just empathy,
[SPEAKER_04]: but sort of really understand is
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's not a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there needs to be more with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think getting back to essence,
I think the essence discussion removes
[SPEAKER_04]: this notion of competitiveness and what is
really a neoliberal myth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's like the basis of essence is
like, you can't be me, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't be you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And depending on what you believe,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, we're we, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that essence aspect is critical
because if you understand that and you
[SPEAKER_04]: stay true to it, then you have no fear of
somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no competition in that respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I think essence in this
discussion of regeneration is a very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very critical point to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, JP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jacob, you mentioned one earlier that I
really like, which is the regional seed
[SPEAKER_00]: swapping group, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the other one?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm thinking is, because
regenerative is like, we're building this
[SPEAKER_02]: movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're seeing a lot in a little
bit in Colorado, a lot in northern
[SPEAKER_02]: California, we do a lot of our work out
there, is being a regenerative farmer,
[SPEAKER_02]: abiding by these practices, you know,
working towards that has formed
[SPEAKER_02]: partnerships with other similar
like-minded, you know, self-subscribing
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals who are in the distribution
manufacturing ranks where we are having
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers now that are pre-selling their
product before they're ever harvesting it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which takes a huge relief off of them
because they know that it's going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: either the bag appeal, the terpene
profile, the terpene profiles are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be huge, I hope so, coming up,
you know, stop losing these, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of arbitrary strain names that we've
been giving in and really go into what the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene profile is, you know, the effects
they're going to have on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's one, that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But having that, but then having the
quality that they know that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially manufacturers, you know,
so they're coming down into farms and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're harvesting all of the outdoor,
bucking it right down there, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then taking it away and paying for all
of that and the farmers just get to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, set them out right there per
pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a huge relief so they don't
have to worry about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the drying, the curing, all of that space
on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're also seeing, you know,
valleys and different watersheds where the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation climates are very similar are
coming together and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing barn space.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big thing is sharing harvesting,
you know, opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everyone is going to harvest at the
exact same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of having to hire unknown
employees, you can share, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there and really kind of like the whole
barn raising mentality of back in the day
[SPEAKER_02]: can easily translate into, you know,
into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I think a big part of that is
also just having those connections within
[SPEAKER_02]: the farmer community to kind of know
what's on the voucher.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Mother Nature throws stuff at us
every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really helpful to hear someone,
you know, 20 miles south, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, thrips are coming through.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, oh, we got these rusted mines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what I've done over the last
20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that works, you know, and so we're not
trying things on our own and taking a
[SPEAKER_02]: salesman's word for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've had farmers who've actually do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's succeeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one of the new things I've been
seeing is farmers that companion planting
[SPEAKER_02]: with a chamomile and are swearing that
they're getting boosted TC percentages and
[SPEAKER_02]: that their budget even better for making,
you know, hash and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chamomile?
[SPEAKER_02]: So growing chamomile like inners first in
the beds, you know, but there's like some,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's particular strategies
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've heard it from Ted Farms this
year, you know, that they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it's working amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like one of those things where
like, I feel pretty confident telling you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys, I think you should check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I haven't heard any bad
things from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it might affect your watering
strategies a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're really, you know, really dialed
in on your drip, you might want to think
[SPEAKER_02]: about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like things like that, rather than
just hearing it or reading about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, on social media or something,
but having those farmers that are growing
[SPEAKER_02]: the same microclimate that you are and
like what's working and what isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave it with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I really love what everyone shared
about the same things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about collaborative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about mind share.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, co-op is one of the things
that's a big word in NORCAL or sungrown
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperatives where people are actually
banding together to take a distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: and owns more of the distribution space in
the northern California market where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's very hard for craft farmers
to out-compete everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have so much more control of your
channel if you're working together,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least at this stage of their companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I think about it from a
microbial perspective, and I have this
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everyone asks, what about your
competitors?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, what competitors?
[SPEAKER_01]: The other companies that are making
microbes that I love and this movement and
[SPEAKER_01]: this value and this why they're doing the
same thing, they're not my competitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're my allies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll sell their products right along with
mine, and I will encourage people to use
[SPEAKER_01]: those products along with mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone's like, huh, that's a little
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the power of a why.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, regenerative farmers,
sun-grown farmers, all these concepts work
[SPEAKER_01]: well together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you collaborate, community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mind share, it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be a fear-based
competition, and honestly, if you talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about the high tide rises all ships,
it's just true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it starts with that collaboration and
community, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic, Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we got about 10 minutes for
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got about 10 minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to let the three of you know that
each of you are invited to respond,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't feel like you have to jump on a
question that, you know, you don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: have anything on, and it will just move
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if all three of you want to get on a
question, you know, don't hesitate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Shango.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all of us farmers have fields and soil
that we can work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of us really want to bring on that
regenerative mindset to the way we do
[SPEAKER_05]: things, maybe in a greenhouse and
containers, or in indoor space and
[SPEAKER_05]: containers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you speak on some regenerative
practices for folks who are in those
[SPEAKER_05]: situations?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think as we all start gaining
our right to breathe, our right to grow,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of us are going to want to grow in
our backyards or in our house and our
[SPEAKER_05]: tents.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what are some regenerative
practices that we can do to be in line
[SPEAKER_05]: with that kind of philosophy and way of
thinking?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something like any indoor grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regenerative is a living soil,
if you can, can start to go in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if you're growing in pots,
use that soil, find a space, compost it,
[SPEAKER_02]: get soil tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil tests are huge, you know,
so therefore you're not guessing but you
[SPEAKER_02]: can really dial in precisely how much
nutrients that soil needs and how to apply
[SPEAKER_02]: it, when to apply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to change a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Conn can speak on behalf of
that when it comes to like NPK stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: what we need in the soil biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think also when indoor grow is,
because we do a lot of sustainability for
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor grow, is looking at your energy,
water, and waste streams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as simple as how are you sourcing
your products.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can buy super sex and use them,
buy that rather than plastic, palletized
[SPEAKER_02]: bags of soil and reduce your waste there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually measure what your waste is every
week and what are you looking at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's compostable?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's plastics recyclables?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what's just going to be solid,
useful waste that's going to go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: landfill?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can you do it and what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's always going to be gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really get away from that but
kind of really fine tune it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your lighting systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really look at your PPFD and can you
afford to get new lights?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the lighting efficiency of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So micromoles per joule.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really want I would say 1.9 or above.
[SPEAKER_02]: So LED is even double ended.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just how much of the energy is
using is going to be turned into usable
[SPEAKER_02]: lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then look at your distribution of your
lights and try to have as much biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: spacing as possible of those lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can reduce your lights there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time of day use and staggering of rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all of those combined can save you
20 to 30% of your lighting, which for an
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor pro could be 40, 50% of your total
overall cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a lot of things there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like using data to help inform
your decisions and really tracking what
[SPEAKER_02]: that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're over here now.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an outdoor farmer as well as an indoor
farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the indoor, we got pollinated on the
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we won't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_06]: On the indoor, we got pollinated.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had problems with mics, spotted mics,
two-spotted mics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're 500 plants down.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're now down to 50.
[SPEAKER_06]: We, of course, removed the plants,
the dirt is somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is, what I'm getting from you
is I can make money creating my own
[SPEAKER_06]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what can I do with the dirt that had
the mics in it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a way to mediate that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so we're talking about soil,
not plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are products and natural products
out there that you can probably mitigate a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's composting techniques,
depending on the volume of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can get rid of the eggs and
probably burn out through the heat of the
[SPEAKER_01]: composting a lot of those insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a process, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be clear, there's time, there's
resources, there's space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to actually do that, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would say also, on the front end,
you can improve or at least try to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify your sources of potential
contamination or infection and work on
[SPEAKER_01]: those processes so you don't invite those
pests in, whether they come in on your
[SPEAKER_01]: clones or they come in on your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identify that because once you got them,
you got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pests and pest pressures everywhere,
that's nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no such thing as no pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just levels of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a probability game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're playing the probability game
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you can treat everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have something, you might always
have a level of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to keep it low enough that you
can manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so thinking about your front end
processes, people, not only spores
[SPEAKER_01]: covering them, but they potentially,
as soon as you brush up against a bush,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have a bug on your
shoulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to just look at that,
at how we're managing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so I think one thing is farmers are
notorious for not valuing their time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I would say is it's easy for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have quality analytics that we deliver
with every batch of soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're testing, and we are testing
those things so you know exactly what
[SPEAKER_04]: comes into your grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we know the impact that pests can
have and how important it is to have
[SPEAKER_04]: really good understanding of what's coming
in on the front end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from my perspective, this is part
of the reason why we exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's who you're working with and
the co-creators or the suppliers that are
[SPEAKER_04]: supplying you good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ship directly to growers for that
reason, because we can manage the supply
[SPEAKER_04]: chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know exactly, it came from our door
and went to your door.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know the analytics when it left our
facility and arrived at your door.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that's pretty critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why we exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say a couple things to think about
with your situation with the mites and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be solarization.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing is covering a big plastic,
letting it really heat up, predatory
[SPEAKER_02]: mites, and then potentially planting trap
plants in there, depending on the mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants that the mites are going to love
that you can then remove and take them off
[SPEAKER_02]: site are just some ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing that ties into the whole
regenerative thing is that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: create ecosystems and mimic nature within
our grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mimic nature that's going to work for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nature, of course, is a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a really well-balanced
ecosystem, you're going to have mites,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they'll never get to population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And explosion, or they're going to be a
huge problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really going to target your wheat
plants, which is kind of nature indicating
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant doesn't need to be here anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so instead of using a lot of
pesticides, you just overplant a little
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% more and then thin it out as needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then breed of what you're really
seeing on your property.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these plants are killing it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they might resist and have never had an
issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is genetics we want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just some ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got time for one last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: This question is to Mammoth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm the first on board.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just did my first grow in September.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've talked to you on the internet
about seeing somebody that was using your
[SPEAKER_03]: name trying to sell me a bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at the emblem, seeing that the
emblem was on its head, seeing that it
[SPEAKER_03]: said Mammoth, and it found you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, all right, this company must be
somebody that's worthy of a name while
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody would be stealing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, you must be famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my question is, now using your
product, I use your product in my first
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that your product kicked ass
when I went to the hydro store.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now my question is, when using your
product, is that something that I can use
[SPEAKER_03]: on a daily enrichment of when I'm
ordering?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I put that on my order process?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do I use it once a week?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the time frame that I should be
using that product?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad that you're getting into the growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have a lot of impossibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oscar's on Instagram, so sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nature in a bottle with precision
functionality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you have a lot of flexibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to think about the performance
and the economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it continuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers see great results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 0.6 mil per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using it twice a week in your feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have big feed tanks, you can just
add it in there and feed it in through the
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick question, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now with that, is that the 0.6 for
hydroponics, or is that the soil loss?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early on, it used to have different
regimes for soil versus hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_01]: through hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we realized is with regular
applications, the data seems so similar
[SPEAKER_01]: with yield and quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we just reduced it to that low 0.6
mil per gallon application rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brings more value to growers with about
the same results.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now, with using it, we're talking to
the hydroponics group.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said to pretty much, I think,
triple, or that's what I took from them,
[SPEAKER_03]: that I should triple the amount of volume
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use it more, but then cause an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Won't cause an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a diminishing return.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find that balance where
you're not going to get that return by the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual additives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you want to have that point where
you continue to see the increase with
[SPEAKER_01]: increased applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you find that point, that's where
you're going to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to talk with you offline on
that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you've got access to the real Colin,
and not one of his online imposters,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's thank our guests, Colin Bell,
Jacob Paulitzer, and John Paul Maxfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see this presentation
again, or if you want to show it to
[SPEAKER_00]: friends or business partners, it'll be on
the Shaping Fire YouTube page in about two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next week.
