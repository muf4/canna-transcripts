[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't been to one of your meetings
before, so I wasn't sure how formal it
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that I see how warm and casual it
is, I think I'm just going to have a seat
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of standing up and pontificating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I also regret not wearing shorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my plan for today is to just go through
a topical understanding of how cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: relates to Parkinson's and to tell you a
little bit about how people here on Bashon
[SPEAKER_01]: are already getting relief from symptoms
using very specific types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to be clear at the outset that I
am not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have formal medical training.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I have been working with patients
across the board, including Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_01]: patients for the last five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: On my podcast called Shaping Fire,
I interview the top doctors in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: on a range of health issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Including Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have been working one-on-one with
patients for several years now so that I
[SPEAKER_01]: get to see and experience their individual
experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we all know, Parkinson's
manifests differently for different folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that said, if you feel inspired by
anything that I share with you today,
[SPEAKER_01]: please be sure to not drastically change
your medicine or do anything drastic like
[SPEAKER_01]: that without checking in with your primary
doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make any big change just based on
what I'm saying here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The information that I'm hoping to share
with you today is to supplement the
[SPEAKER_01]: research that you're probably already
doing on your own so that you have access
[SPEAKER_01]: to nice, clean information about
Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we all know, if you look up any
information on the internet, your mileage
[SPEAKER_01]: may vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: On its quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in addition to being an educator of
patients and doctors on how to use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, or also known as marijuana,
in the clinic, I also have a weekly
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also the founder of the Vashon
Island Marijuana Enthusiasts Alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And originally when we started the
organization, the organization was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a trade organization for all of the
medical marijuana companies that had
[SPEAKER_01]: started on Vashon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were over 100 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small cottage businesses that were
supplying cannabis and edibles and oils
[SPEAKER_01]: and various products to the medical
dispensaries across the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, Washington has changed
gears and dismantled the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: program in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, the companies,
the cottage industries that had started on
[SPEAKER_01]: the island were no longer legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them didn't have the kind of
money that it took to become a licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: company in the state, which most people
put between $250,000 and $500,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, the organization on the
island transitioned to be primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: patient outreach and education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get together about every six weeks
at the Grange Hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a guest speaker come in,
really world class speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will come in and teach about
either cannabis medicine or about the
[SPEAKER_01]: botany of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's happening here on Vashon
and who I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I get into the specifics of both
the precursors to Parkinson's and how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis can help, I want to jump to the
end first so that you kind of know where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're seeing on Vashon is very
significant reduction in the symptoms of
[SPEAKER_01]: Parkinson's patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, the most obvious help is
in symptoms that are involved with motor
[SPEAKER_01]: skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tremors and stooping and muscle
clenching.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of all different muscle sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people started, Parkinson's patients
started coming to the meetings at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Grange Hall and asking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one way or another, they were
getting their hands on the appropriate
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis medicine, which I'll talk about a
little more later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results have been astounding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much to my surprise, none of the
Parkinson's patients I work with on the
[SPEAKER_01]: island are actually here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe it's because they're already
familiar with what I'm going to say today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me tell you about one particular
patient, which I think really stands out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was working with this fellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in his early 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his Parkinson's had progressed to
motor skills issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had tremors in his right arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had muscle clenching that was causing
his hand to stay closed most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the two that he really hated,
he had muscle clenching in his back,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was causing him to stoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then caused him to shuffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he really disliked the shuffling
because he felt that that telegraphed to
[SPEAKER_01]: other people that he wasn't feeling 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that changed the nature of the
conversation people wanted to have with
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want to talk to him about just
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to talk to him about his
stooping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that annoyed him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so his wife came to one of the
meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she got some more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she was able to get a tincture
for him and took it home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I hear back from patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I heard from her now three days later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she came by my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she started with giving me a big hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, all right, well,
at least I know this is a good meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after giving me a big hug,
she said, I've got to tell you what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, my husband has just been
getting worse and worse over the last few
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with all the things that I'd already
told you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, this morning, while I was
preparing breakfast, she said I heard the
[SPEAKER_01]: lawnmower for the first time in years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she stopped what she was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she went outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her husband was mowing the lawn with a
big smile on his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she went over and hugged him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he turned off the mower for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they talked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said it was the first time in years
that he was able to stand up straight and
[SPEAKER_01]: felt loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That his tremors had entirely disappeared,
at least for that moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was not shuffling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was able to actually exert force
through his human without losing balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And was able to mow the lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though they have a
conservative-sized patch of lawn,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was obviously a big breakthrough for
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're almost a year and a half
after that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And except on the rare occasion when he
forgets to take his cannabis medication,
[SPEAKER_01]: he is nearly without any visual symptoms
that you can point him and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, he must have Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for sometimes at the end of the day
when he's tired, I'll be at their house
[SPEAKER_01]: visiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'll have a slight tremor in his hand
just from being exhausted from the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for them, it's been a wild success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on Vashon, I would say that is a fair
generalization of people's success.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two things that I have found that most
impede people from having a positive
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with cannabis and their
Parkinson's is, number one, just like with
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals, each person is built a
little differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a little bit of time at the
beginning of taking cannabis to find the
[SPEAKER_01]: right dosage in combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a little experimentation at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some folks don't have the temperament
or just patience for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want it all right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to have to experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gosh, when I recommend journaling,
sometimes people just rebel right at
[SPEAKER_01]: journaling at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people, they get frustrated at the
very beginning, say just like a week,
[SPEAKER_01]: to have to dial in the appropriate dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then second, as we all know,
there's still a lot of peer pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: against cannabis from people who know it
more as a taboo drug from the early years
[SPEAKER_01]: before we realized that actually it's an
ancient herbal medicine that's been used
[SPEAKER_01]: by humans for over 30,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only been the last 50 years that
we haven't been using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the extraordinary and odd part
of our experience with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have a lot more of a history
of using it every day for a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: health issues instead of seeing it as a
negative thing in our culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the two main reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to dial in the dosage and also just
succumbing to peer pressure from people
[SPEAKER_01]: around them to not use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or occasionally, people just don't feel
good about it themselves because of what
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been taught to each their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am here to offer you some
information in case your mind is open to
[SPEAKER_01]: using cannabis medicine, how you might
want to think about that, and how you
[SPEAKER_01]: could approach it for your best results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 25 years ago, we discovered a new
system in our bodies that up to then had
[SPEAKER_01]: not been discovered called the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the endocannabinoid system is
fascinating because it produces
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids very similar to the ones that
are in marijuana, in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our own body is producing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: When our bodies produce them, they are
called endogenous cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning produced inside of the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they're produced by the plant,
they're called phytocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're made by phytosynthesis and
a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're incredibly similar to each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our endocannabinoid system,
which up to 25 years ago, we were totally
[SPEAKER_01]: unfamiliar with, we now understand it to
be the master regulator for some two dozen
[SPEAKER_01]: of our body's systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's amazing that something that would
be the master regulator was unheard of for
[SPEAKER_01]: so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It regulates, including in the two dozen
systems, are your likelihood for fight or
[SPEAKER_01]: flight, your response to things that might
scare you and you need to respond to,
[SPEAKER_01]: appetite and digestion, your GI tract,
sexual arousal, the mix of chemicals in
[SPEAKER_01]: your brain, which also makes sense that
then it would also moderate anxiety and
[SPEAKER_01]: depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your brain protection maintenance systems,
that we'll be talking about a lot today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, signaling issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, your toe reporting to your
brain that you've stubbed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when your endocannabinoid system gets
weakened, there is now a scientifically
[SPEAKER_01]: determined name for this, called
endocannabinoid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this means is that you've got
your endocannabinoid system, but your body
[SPEAKER_01]: is not producing enough cannabinoids in
order to stay robust and run all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different vital body systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what makes your endocannabinoid system
weak is pretty much a definition of living
[SPEAKER_01]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that can weaken your
endocannabinoid system include stress,
[SPEAKER_01]: questionable nutrition, using
pharmaceuticals, not getting enough
[SPEAKER_01]: exercise, and long term anxiety or
depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is the more that your body
gets taxed, the more likely it is that
[SPEAKER_01]: your body's not producing enough
cannabinoids inside itself to take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: all these systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, not part of the conversation today,
but also associated with cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency is fibrobiology, irritable
bowel syndrome, and increased migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis by itself is a
neuroprotective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for years it was said that cannabis
makes you dumb, and people who smoke pot
[SPEAKER_01]: are dumb, and they get more dumb as they
smoke more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though we may all have some life
experiences that may support that
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence, because we all know someone
who's lazy and also smokes marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's also a lot of brilliant people who
are very active and productive that smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that cannabis is a
neuroprotective is because of two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, it causes neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have enough cannabinoids in your
system, your brain actually produces more
[SPEAKER_01]: brain cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, I was told that once you
killed a brain cell, that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't get a chance to replace them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But modern science is showing us that
that's actually not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had just never done the studies on
cannabis, which is one of the few things
[SPEAKER_01]: that caused the creation of new brain
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, cannabis, working with the
endocannabinoid system, helps moderate
[SPEAKER_01]: what is essentially the brain's
self-cleaning and ability to take out the
[SPEAKER_01]: trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens, and this is one of
the things that gets a lot of interest
[SPEAKER_01]: from Alzheimer's patients, is that when
your brain doesn't take out the trash
[SPEAKER_01]: regularly, plaque starts to build up on
the end of the neural endings and the
[SPEAKER_01]: neural pathway and impedes communication
between different neurons in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is eventually what leads to
Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you're using cannabis in the
correct way, it kickstarts your
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system, and that
endocannabinoid system starts cleaning
[SPEAKER_01]: your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for Alzheimer's patients, I get all
the strong response of, I'm feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: brighter, I'm feeling lighter,
I'm remembering more things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And similarly, we'll talk about more of
this in a moment, but with Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, you're getting a lot of the same
benefit because Parkinson's disease is
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with compromised motor function
after about 60 to 80% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: dopamine-producing neurons are damaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so without the dopamine that's
produced by these particular neurons,
[SPEAKER_01]: this leads to the physical attributes that
we're familiar with with Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we wanna do is we wanna protect
those dopamine-producing neurons as much
[SPEAKER_01]: as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that the endocannabinoid
system is causing our brain to clean
[SPEAKER_01]: itself, it can start to clean and repair
many of these dopamine-creating cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so the last thing I wanna talk
about on the symptoms aspect is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I've talked a little bit about
the classic motor symptoms so far,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is usually how you can identify
someone third persons that they may have
[SPEAKER_01]: Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the other symptoms that are
associated with Parkinson's, which might
[SPEAKER_01]: not be as visual, also can be remedied
with low doses of cannabis as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: including decreased facial expressions,
dementia, fatigue, sleep disturbances,
[SPEAKER_01]: depression, constipation, cognitive
changes, fear, anxiety, and urinary
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting is if you look at
this list, these are all mechanisms within
[SPEAKER_01]: the body that are moderated by the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so cannabis can help you on two
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the first level, it can be a
preventative and it can also help decrease
[SPEAKER_01]: the symptoms that a patient is
experiencing, but also it can decrease the
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms by strengthening the
endocannabinoid system so even if you
[SPEAKER_01]: still have Parkinson's, you won't have a
degradation of your life quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything I've told you so far is
strongly supported with scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence of studies that are taking place
in Europe right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because cannabis is still a schedule one
drug, in the United States, those studies
[SPEAKER_01]: are not happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a new group of studies that are
on their way, which are showing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since you all have probably researched
Parkinson's much more than I have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably familiar with people
starting to tie Parkinson's symptoms to
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on in the gut, in the
microbiome of your stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this new science is suggesting that
when your gut flora is overly acidic and
[SPEAKER_01]: your endocannabinoid system is deficient,
poor signals are sent between the gut and
[SPEAKER_01]: the brain, which can make Parkinson's even
worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the great things about using
cannabis is that your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system moderates your gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mix of chemicals, the cleaning of the
cilia that moves your food along,
[SPEAKER_01]: and your ability to take, extract
nutrition from the food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while this is newer science than
the other aspects I've talked about so
[SPEAKER_01]: far, I wanted to mention it because if
you've been doing some work trying to eat
[SPEAKER_01]: more raw foods, get rid of your GERD or
heartburn, or just work with the chemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: of your gut, cannabis is a good option for
you as well because the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system moderates the tummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, what we're looking at is
the symptoms that you're experiencing are
[SPEAKER_01]: all moderated by your endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if most Americans are deficient in
their internal cannabinoid making,
[SPEAKER_01]: what can we do to help?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is with supplementation.
[SPEAKER_01]: By taking the phyto cannabinoids that are
produced within the cannabis plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: then taking them ourselves, to make up for
the fact that we're not producing as many
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about typical methods of
dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I get a lot of
pushback from patients on, especially when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just learning about cannabis,
is that they don't want to get high and
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't want to be smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We all spend a lot of our lives cracking
jokes about stoners and about what that
[SPEAKER_01]: does to your life, and those folks get
judged a lot, and none of us like to get
[SPEAKER_01]: judged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, except for a very small group of
people who actually prefer the smoking or
[SPEAKER_01]: the enjoyment factor of it, and they like
to get high while they're getting their
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, I don't recommend smoking
cannabis for nearly any of the symptoms
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're looking for relief from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend that you take it orally,
because when you smoke marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are inhaling it, it's going into your
lungs, and the cannabinoids immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: jump from the lungs to your blood and then
goes to your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're getting all of the medicine
fast at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the THC, part of the cannabis,
is what makes you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of that reaches your brain at
the same time, and at that point,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're feeling some level of
disorientation, and soon after,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll probably want to eat everything in
your fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the process is different when you
eat something, though, because it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: into your body, and if you're taking a
tincture, some of it will soak in through
[SPEAKER_01]: your mouth, but if you're eating an
edible, it's got to go all the way through
[SPEAKER_01]: your GI tract and get filtered by your
liver, and then finds its way to your
[SPEAKER_01]: blood there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any way that you take it orally is
you're likely going to get better
[SPEAKER_01]: experience than if you were to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm not saying that smoking doesn't
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking can work, but it's just not for
everybody, and so we're going to focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: the solution that seems to be for more
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to take it orally,
then what are your options?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we all know the classic pot brownie,
and a lot of people find very good results
[SPEAKER_01]: with taking a regular diet of brownies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't usually recommend that to
patients that I work with, because number
[SPEAKER_01]: one, they're a little better if you buy
them at the store, but if you tend to make
[SPEAKER_01]: your own brownies at home, brownie one and
six and 12 are all going to have different
[SPEAKER_01]: strengths, because it's really hard to
homogenize the medicine throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: baked goods, and while they're much better
at the commercial level in stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still not perfect, but it's certainly
much better than Grandma Mary's brownies
[SPEAKER_01]: who used to make them in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, most of the patients that I talk to
are trying to avoid extra calories,
[SPEAKER_01]: let alone to be taken as often as they
would need to take something to help with
[SPEAKER_01]: their Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all like, you know,
I'm eating three brownies a day,
[SPEAKER_01]: seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm going to have to start a
whole new exercise regime just to help
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigate the weight gain from trying to
deal with my Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, cookies and brownies and
candies are not always the best solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some people, they find that they
really like lozenges, because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's not as much to it,
there's no flour, there's less sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely some good lozenges
options.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the things that I would put
in the kind of like a food category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the second category are capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are an increasing number of
companies that make cannabis capsules that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be purchased in the recreational
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish I could make a generalization
and say you can't go wrong, or even to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're all bad, but it's neither.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recipes that are put into the capsules
vary from maker to maker, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: hassle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll talk more about where to purchase
capsules and the like later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, I just want to say that
the person behind the counter at a
[SPEAKER_01]: reputable cannabis store should be able to
guide you to their products that are more
[SPEAKER_01]: medical than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: At its base, all cannabis is medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that different people are using
different kinds of cannabis for different
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you tell them that, listen,
I'm looking for a capsule with very little
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar that's reliable for Parkinson's,
with a little luck, the store clerk will
[SPEAKER_01]: guide you in the right place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's food, capsules, and then my
favorite, which is tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all familiar with tinctures of
acanacea or marshmallow root for the
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole range of tinctures that we
can use that are made from taking the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and soaking it in alcohol,
and then straining out the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's left of the alcohol is the
essential constituents of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: That same thing works for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a very simple way, that's
essentially how you make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take the dried flowers, you soak them
in alcohol, you strain them, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully lab test it, and then you've got
a tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have been taking tinctures for
hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, before cannabis was
banned in the United States, it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily used tincture for a whole host
of human ailments, and it took up 70% of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pharmacopeia, which is essentially the
pharmacist's guide to what to give people
[SPEAKER_01]: from everything from migraines and hot
flashes to menstrual cramps and general
[SPEAKER_01]: pains.
[SPEAKER_01]: To cross the board, it was because it
helped the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though we didn't know that then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I also like about the tincture is
that when you buy a tincture over the
[SPEAKER_01]: counter, and sometimes from neighbors,
they'll be lab tested, and so you know
[SPEAKER_01]: that every time you take it, it's going to
be exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you find what your correct dosage is
for you, you'll be like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: I take one third of a dropper,
and so every time you take that third of a
[SPEAKER_01]: dropper, you know that the dosing is
always the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that I like about tincture
is that it's variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a lot of control as the
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're getting capsules, it's got a
set amount of cannabinoids from cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in it, but every time you take it,
you have to take the same amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as we all know, lots of times you
might want less of medicine on some days,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe you're feeling a specially bad
and you want to take some more on other
[SPEAKER_01]: days, and so tincture gives you that kind
of flexibility where once you find out
[SPEAKER_01]: what your baseline is, you can change it a
little bit based on what you think your
[SPEAKER_01]: needs are for your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just so happens that arguably the
top neurologist in the country for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in Parkinson's lives on Vashon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ethan Russo lives just above KVI Beach
here, and he's a friend, and he's been on
[SPEAKER_01]: my podcast a few times, and he's spoken at
the Grange Hall a few times, and he's a
[SPEAKER_01]: very active member of the fruit club.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Russo sets dosages after speaking
with the patient, but generally,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says that the threshold to start
getting some sort of benefit is at about
[SPEAKER_01]: 2.5 milligrams of THC, and that THC is the
part of cannabis which can make you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: high if you take enough of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2.5 milligrams, though, is pretty much not
going to get anybody high.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are outliers, say maybe one in 2,000
people, that might feel 2.5 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in all of my years working with
patients, I've only met one person,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is why I now have to say 2.5,
because up to that point, I had said that
[SPEAKER_01]: no one would, but then I met someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 2.5 milligrams of THC is where you just
start to potentially get some medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also says, though, and this is my
experience, that the sweet spot of really
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to have a decrease in the motor
skill symptoms is at 5 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, at 5 milligrams, some people may feel
a little bit of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people experience it as maybe a
little bit of cloudiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people experience it as just feel a
little more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who have had alcohol,
a lot of people, they'll have that
[SPEAKER_01]: cocktail at the end of their business day,
which when it hits their blood,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like, all right, the work day is
over, and now my time is my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: That feeling of relief is how a lot of
people experience 5 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other people just experience 5
milligrams as, oh, the shaking has
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased in my arm, and I'm not clenching
as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they don't experience 5 milligrams
as something added, but more something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's taken away in their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many Parkinson's patients who
will take 10 milligrams, and at 10
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams, just about everybody will feel
some kind of response to the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: More often than not, though, folks will
like that experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not full on stoned and difficult to
talk to and giggling and things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're definitely feeling some sort of
sense of relief from your symptoms and
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a release of your day's stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And occasionally, just occasionally,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might want to be a little more careful
going to slap off the light switch on the
[SPEAKER_01]: wall, because it might take a little more
effort to zone into the target.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the patients that I've worked
with, the slight feelings of differentness
[SPEAKER_01]: that they get with that low dose of
cannabis is well worth getting rid of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other symptoms that are causing them
discomfort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you may have looked on YouTube for
videos of Parkinson's patients trying
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you haven't, I recommend that you
give it a try, because it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: remarkable.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most popular videos is of this
fellow sitting on his couch at home,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he has got advanced Parkinson's with a
range of severe motor symptoms that he's
[SPEAKER_01]: suffering through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his buddy gives him a small amount of
cannabis oil and puts it underneath his
[SPEAKER_01]: tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the patient is playing with it in his
mouth, so it's soaking in through his
[SPEAKER_01]: mucosal membranes in his mouth and his
tongue and his cheeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're running a timer at the bottom
of the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the first minute or so,
you don't notice any difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're tempted to turn off the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, nothing's happening,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the time you've hit two minutes,
you can see him instead of being over to
[SPEAKER_01]: the side, he's starting to sit up more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by three minutes, his spasticity
is decreased, his hand isn't clenched
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore, and he's sitting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's by about the four
minutes, you cannot visually tell that
[SPEAKER_01]: this gentleman has got Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a best case scenario for
certain, because he had the right
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, taken sublingually, that was
easily taken up by the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything was optimized in that
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it shows the potential in the medicine
of being able to work so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tincture is similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you take the tincture, it's in a
vehicle of 190 proof grain alcohol,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's in that, you don't really
want to take the tincture right in your
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth, because it'll burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you take a little bit of water,
in a juice glass, or shot glass,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you stick a little bit out of the
faucet, and put your squirt in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you drink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And patients tell me that they are
experiencing a lessening of their symptoms
[SPEAKER_01]: within about 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're feeling pretty great by 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they take it regularly as a
preventative, the symptoms just don't come
[SPEAKER_01]: back throughout their day, which is,
of course, the goal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal is not to let the symptoms get
really bad, and then take it and hope for
[SPEAKER_01]: the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal is to get yourself on a schedule
that you know about how long the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: lasts in their system, which is usually
about four to six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then schedule yourself to take small
doses during the day, so it keeps your
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms at bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps your brain clean itself,
so that the signaling in your body starts
[SPEAKER_01]: to be better, and so that you can avoid
the symptoms entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with cannabis, one of the important
aspects of it is to take what we call the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant, or whole plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some people who are selling CBD
extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may have heard about this from
friends, or seen them on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is one
of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easily the second most popular
after THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the one that's had probably the
most research done on it at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: besides THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of the laws don't allow
marijuana in some states still,
[SPEAKER_01]: some people are purchasing just CBD on its
own over the internet, and hoping that
[SPEAKER_01]: that will help them with their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to caution you from that,
because for the medicine to work,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need all of the different constituents
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the THC as part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the CBD, the cannabidiol,
as part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the minor cannabinoids,
which we don't even have them all
[SPEAKER_01]: identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's over 100 of them in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also need the terpenes,
which is the aroma therapy of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over these thousands of years that humans
have been taking the plant with us
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere that we expand and travel over
the world, we've gotten into a synergistic
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the plant, you know how corn has
followed humans because we take corn
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we go, we're selecting the seeds
for the corn that we most like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the plant that we've come to
admit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the plant that we know and love,
especially now during the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing happens with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time humans moved on, they took the
seeds of the plants that made them feel
[SPEAKER_01]: the most healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this happening again and again over
tens of thousands of years means that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that exists right now is more
uniquely refined to help our
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system than it ever has
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tell you this to kind of inoculate
you against suggestions from your friends
[SPEAKER_01]: of, oh, if you need cannabis medicine,
just get this CBD extract online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to do, and you can buy it
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just easier than going over town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resist that temptation because it's not
the true cannabis medicine that's made of
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens when you buy this and you buy
the one that doesn't need to feel good?
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to the place and I told him I don't
want what I needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't know what I needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: She told him what I needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, she said, do you want me to
kind of make you feel good?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, I don't want to feel good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to feel, I mean, I didn't want
to be high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go to a store and you buy
something that you don't deem is
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate for you, and so it's got THC
in it and it makes you feel high,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately in Washington, you can't
return it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're kind of stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your best bet would just be to try to
create value in someone else by giving it
[SPEAKER_01]: to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't return it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my best suggestion would be to
certainly not work with that budtender
[SPEAKER_01]: again at that shop and try to find
somebody who's more of an expert.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't know what they were doing,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't know what I was doing,
so it was kind of a waste of time and a
[SPEAKER_05]: very expensive waste of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, incredibly common.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of, unfortunately they've
got a very poor name.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're known as budtenders, who help you
when you go to the retail stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly there are budtenders that do
their homework, they've gotten medically
[SPEAKER_01]: certified with the state, they work with
patients on their free time, and they know
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, the ratio is very small
to overall, because a lot of folks,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're new to cannabis, they just want
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want a job in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an entry level position.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they get the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they may be familiar with how to help
certain kinds of patients, but not
[SPEAKER_01]: Parkinson's patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recommend that you get as much of
your information in advance and then go
[SPEAKER_01]: asking for a specific product.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I like to recommend the
capsules made by a company called the CPC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the CPC has been making medicine all
the way back years and years during the
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington medical industry days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they are one of the more reputable
companies that transitioned to the
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know the formulator for the
company, Ben, and he is an incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledgeable person who puts patients
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you hear that kind of
recommendation, from somebody in the field
[SPEAKER_01]: who works with patients all the time,
I recommend that you talk with me and
[SPEAKER_01]: others to find out what they're using that
works for them for their Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go pick up the same product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you go into a store and just
blindly ask for something with low THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: high CBD for your Parkinson's,
if you get the wrong product, a blood
[SPEAKER_01]: tender, you may not have a good experience
right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, I encourage you to not give up
if that happens to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the medicine does exist both in
Washington and on Vashon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to find the right source for
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had Parkinson's, who would you go
to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I had Parkinson's, I would
actually buy it locally here on the island
[SPEAKER_01]: from an herbalist that's local here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is where I also need to point
out that that's technically illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so since they got rid of the medical
marijuana industry, it has taken a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: herbalists who used to make custom
medicine for patients and put them into
[SPEAKER_01]: the informal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's challenges with the
recreational market, which is getting
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, just by its name, it's called
the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about 18 months into having a
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mostly, it's the kind of medicine that
can be used for medicine for some people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also a lot of people use it to party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the availability of medicine that
is not made to also party on is still
[SPEAKER_01]: lacking in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, I bet you that 18 months from
now, the market will be flush with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because companies, they respond to market
demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, the medical market was
taking care of tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: people, enough that we had over 1,000
stores just here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only did they get rid of,
they went from over 1,000 stores down to a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more than 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the people in this market were trained
and driven to help patients and some
[SPEAKER_01]: people who were partying, but patients
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the new market has got that in
reverse, where because they wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: establish some revenue first, they went
with the low-hanging crew, which for them
[SPEAKER_01]: was people who party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now after they've got that market
established and they've got some income,
[SPEAKER_01]: now they're kind of circling around the
patients, which are more difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: design products for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes more effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes more experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to circle back to your question,
if you can find an herbalist who has
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in the medical market,
I would say go with somebody that you
[SPEAKER_01]: trust locally and shop local, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Legally though, that exchange is not legal
in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if it's important to you to remain
legal, then I recommend that you go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational store that has a reputation
for being more medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily for us, we have one that's
nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just here in West Seattle, there's a shop
called Canna West Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's C-A-N-N-A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canna West Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are on California Avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have, most of their staff is
actually, has got the state medical
[SPEAKER_01]: certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the owner, Maryam, Maryam actually
used to own a reputable medical dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: before they all got closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's got her heart in the right place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the medical products come out and
are released, she stocks them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to go somewhere close that
understands patients, I can recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: Maryam's shop, Canna West Seattle,
as being a place where you're more likely
[SPEAKER_01]: to get something appropriate than just
walking in anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also go on the State of Washington
website and find out the stores that have
[SPEAKER_01]: received their medical certification from
the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have to have a prescription?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go into stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And buy products that are deemed medical
without having a prescription for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because cannabis is now legal in the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, because really all cannabis is
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that some products are really
made directly for patients versus for
[SPEAKER_01]: patients and to party on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, the most common
recommended dosage for Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_01]: patients is 10 milligrams of CBD and five
milligrams of THC taken at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's whole plant, you're also
getting a sprinkling of all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that are in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting some terpenes and some
flavonoids and some CBNs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBG and all these lesser known
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the two that would likely be written
on the package is 10 milligrams of CBD and
[SPEAKER_01]: five milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one of the reasons why I recommend
tinctures is because I like to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: patients to buy one tincture that's all
THC and one tincture that's all CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, you can play with the ratio
yourself so that you find out what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: best ratio for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: For many Parkinson's patients,
that ratio is two to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two parts CBD to every one part THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The combination is supported by studies
and by a lot of first hand experience that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just seen with patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you may find that you're more
sensitive to THC and you don't want five
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you'd rather take it more often
during the day and have less THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for you, the 10 milligrams of CBD might
be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead of taking five milligrams,
you'd actually prefer to have 2.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: So buying two tinctures, one that's THC
and one that's CBD, you might find out has
[SPEAKER_01]: more flexibility to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely going to find over time
that you become more sophisticated with
[SPEAKER_01]: how you want to dose yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This takes some education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we've been using the cannabis
plant for tens of thousands of years,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the people who are making the
medicine are relearning what was
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially a lost craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: The store employees are relearning not
only how to talk to patients, but what to
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients ourselves, which I am,
I had a brain injury and that's how that I
[SPEAKER_01]: got into medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a brain injury and so I had to learn
about medical cannabis to help with my
[SPEAKER_01]: brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to learn the appropriate kind of
cannabis and the dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how people say about a band,
oh, they were an instant success.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were instantly popular, but they
don't know the band had been gigging and
[SPEAKER_01]: traveling for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a pretty reliable solution for
Parkinson's symptoms and with long term
[SPEAKER_01]: use, decreasing even the cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you got to go through some leg work at
the beginning to find the right dosage of
[SPEAKER_01]: the right product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you find the right dosage of the
right product, it's actually quite,
[SPEAKER_01]: to say it's quite simple to moderate your
symptoms,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's funny because I'm not supposed to say
it's going to help everybody, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the people that I've worked
on on Bashon, we're 11 for 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one person who told me that they
didn't care for it, I don't think that
[SPEAKER_01]: they were patient with learning their way
through the dosing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, it's not a solution for
everybody, but based on the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked with nationally and the people
that I've talked with right here on
[SPEAKER_01]: Bashon, some people call it Parkinson's
low hanging fruit for cannabis because
[SPEAKER_01]: Parkinson's is so directly tied to the
endocannabinoid system.
So I have a question.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: These patients who have had good
responses, are they using other
[SPEAKER_06]: Parkinson's medications also?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody I spoke to is using other
Parkinson's medicines as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said at the beginning, I don't
recommend that you get on the cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: then immediately get off of your scripts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know several patients that have.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have either decreased their dosage or
gotten off them totally if they're very
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the beginning, they take both
because there's no negative interplay that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only negative interplay that we've
seen is that with just a couple epilepsy
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs, there seems to be some interaction
with high, high doses of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the Parkinson's realm, I've come
across no negative interaction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not as familiar with dystonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you just tell me a little bit about
it so that I understand what biological,
[SPEAKER_01]: what human system it works with?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the short answer is without having read
the research, my immediate conclusion
[SPEAKER_01]: would be yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually glad that you mentioned
this because I missed this earlier in my
[SPEAKER_01]: notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main components of cannabis that
we've been talking about today are THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons that people love
CBD and why it's used for a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients is because it supports the body's
signaling system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our signaling system has to do with a
lot of different problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll use pain as an example first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD is often used for pain patients
because while THC is an analgesic,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it kind of dumbs down the pain,
when someone has got endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency, let's say that you injure your
leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the leg communicates to the brain
that there's a problem, it sends it for
[SPEAKER_01]: the first time full force.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we've got pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be alert to the leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after you recognize that,
it's supposed to turn down the volume so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you continue to go get medical care,
but it shouldn't be giving you that
[SPEAKER_01]: initial signal constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with pain patients we run into all
the time that because they've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: weakened endocannabinoid, system the leg
keeps on reporting back, we're in trouble,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're in trouble, very loud every single
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the experience of their pain is
severe.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they start taking CBD, it turns down
the experience of pain because the
[SPEAKER_01]: signaling system is working more properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leg is calling out to the brain,
hey, we got a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The brain says, okay, we've made a note of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can turn down your signal and sends
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now while you still might feel the
pain, you don't feel it as intensely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly with muscle sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're experiencing a muscle set
clenching, say maybe the hand is clenching
[SPEAKER_01]: or the forearm is clenching, which then
may be causing some amount of tremors,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're experiencing is the brain
sending a signal to the muscle set to
[SPEAKER_01]: clench.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it needs to be turned off because you
don't want it to clench.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of what can relieve this
experience is having a healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system where the signaling
between the brain and the muscle sets
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes optimized and rebalanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, causes the relaxing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why the gentleman who I
started my talk talking about who was
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting the lawn, that's what his
experience is.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd be all clenched up because there's
this constant signal to tighten these
[SPEAKER_01]: muscle sets and he would get sore from it
and then he'd get sore on this other side
[SPEAKER_01]: of his body in sympathy of that side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then after he started taking this CBD
whole plant medicine, that signaling
[SPEAKER_01]: system rebalanced itself and so now the
signal is no longer stuck on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking now about an isolated
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you saying, you're still saying take
it with the KHC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, so the long and the short of it
is, is that there is not as much research
[SPEAKER_01]: done on the entire family of cannabinoids
yet for us to know what role the minor
[SPEAKER_01]: ones play.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do know is if you give someone
just CBD, they don't have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know that it's not the isolated
molecule and the studies that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: done, have been done with CBD in the
presence of whole plant cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's the interplay between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without having read the specific
research on your question, I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: that that sounds like a signaling disorder
that would be certainly helped by the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your research, there's, it's
identifying marijuana strains that will
[SPEAKER_02]: help it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it also identify strains that don't
help it then?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the research does not focus on
particular strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It focuses on molecular components of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so different strains will have more,
will have better effect for different
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but knowing the strain mostly only
helps patients who are smoking it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people smoke a particular strain,
but when people buy products in the store,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not usually identified by the
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to go and buy a two to one
capsule, 10, 10 milligrams of CBD and 5
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of THC, it won't say the strain
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will identify the ingredients as
molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got this much CBD, this much THC,
and other minor cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, if you were looking
to source a strain, say for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a patient who wanted to grow their
own medicine, which is very common on
[SPEAKER_01]: Bashan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend that you find a strain
that is high in CBD and very low in THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also find one and give that a
try.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're probably going to need
additional THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then also grow another one that's just
a THC strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you mix those together,
that would be the right strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There certainly are strains that naturally
come out at two to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the Harlequin strain is a
very popular strain with Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that comes out naturally being
two parts CBD to every one part THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't want to give you the
impression that you need to go find the
[SPEAKER_01]: Harlequin strain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to grow it, we can talk about
where you might be able to get plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally occur at two to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, as far as getting medicine
goes, you're going to buy it based on what
[SPEAKER_01]: the ingredient are molecularly in the
package versus by a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all benefit, no negative?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the only negative that I have come
across for Parkinson's patients in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is if you accidentally take more
THC than you want, and you can have an
[SPEAKER_01]: over-medicated experience, which is also
known as just getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a wide spectrum on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's medicinal doses for Parkinson's
that work, and you won't feel it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people need a little bit more,
and you might get some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cloudy-headedness and appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many people just feel relief from
stress, and that's actually a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, let's say that you're not on a
schedule, and let's say you mess up your
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: You normally take it three times a day,
and because you have forgotten you take it
[SPEAKER_01]: now, and then you take it again in a half
hour, suddenly you're doubling up on your
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at these low doses, you're probably
not going to have an over-medication
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some patients need to take 20,
30, 40 milligrams of THC, which is eight
[SPEAKER_01]: times what I'm recommending.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that kind of a patient, if they
accidentally take it and then take it
[SPEAKER_01]: again in a half hour, they could have
what's at the far end.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're having an over-medicated
experience, which is not pleasant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may experience paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll probably experience a rapid
heartbeat, because it can lower your blood
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might cause you to have some clammy
sweats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, I've only had that happen
three times in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first two times, I totally felt
like maybe I should call the paramedics,
[SPEAKER_01]: because my body was doing weird things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I got more educated, I realized
that no one has ever died from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your mind might be telling you that
these are unfamiliar feelings and I need
[SPEAKER_01]: medical help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just stick with it,
go for a calm walk in your yard,
[SPEAKER_01]: lay down in your bed to try to take a nap,
or there's some other good things you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smell black smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smell black pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black pepper tends to reduce the
experience of cannabis, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: drinking lemonade, because the citrine in
the lemonade decreases your high as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: All things that you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you get that high and you don't
want to be and it's negative, it's a drag,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it won't kill you and you just gotta
wait it out for 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll come down and you're like,
okay, I need to be more careful with my
[SPEAKER_01]: dosing regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that was one thing I was gonna add
was saying that I didn't hear was edibles,
[SPEAKER_02]: six to eight hours of experience with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a really high dosage of
edibles, you can't have a whole day thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you were to go in and ask for an
edible as a new patient for Parkinson's,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is no way that they should sell you
a strong enough edible to get that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, if you get an edible,
and let's say it's a chocolate bar,
[SPEAKER_01]: and each of the little squares is 10
milligrams, and you're only supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: take one square, and you eat it,
that's good chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then maybe you're tempted to take a
second one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you start to get the munchies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanna make sure you have something
else to take, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or as the classic thing to happen,
I forget the name of this senator,
[SPEAKER_01]: but early in canvas legalization,
she flew from some East Coast state to
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, and she bought a chocolate bar
that was supposed to be eight doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she didn't read the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't do her homework as a
responsible patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when she got back in the van and they
drove on, she ate the chocolate bar,
[SPEAKER_01]: just enjoying the chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she didn't realize it was eight doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she had an intense experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: She went to the hospital, and it became
national news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one group of people are all like,
see, marijuana medicine is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then present marijuana patients were
all like, she's being irresponsible with
[SPEAKER_01]: her medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't say that she was responsible
if she didn't read the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ate all of her OxyContin either,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We would say that's a patient error.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, same thing if you're taking more
than you're supposed to with THC as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if you're talking about the
difference between 5 and 10 milligrams or
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 and 20 milligrams, we're talking about
45 minutes before you're feeling at least
[SPEAKER_01]: a little more like yourself and not
concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in these type of cases, when you're
trying to take 5 or 10 milligrams and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're taking 100 milligrams, that's a
difficult day you're not going to probably
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe enjoy a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate your energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love teaching about cannabis
medicine, so I get enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think financial kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much does this tincture cost?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the insurance companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, insurance companies will
not come anywhere near this until it's
[SPEAKER_01]: federally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so unfortunately, that means that
we've got to all pay for it out of pocket,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a drag.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recreational stores are presently more
expensive than they were in the old
[SPEAKER_01]: medical days because they've got a lot
more overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got to pay for advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like that that didn't really
happen very much in the medical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that a bottle of tincture
in the recreational market will probably
[SPEAKER_01]: run you between $55 and $75, depending on
the strength and who you buy it from and
[SPEAKER_01]: at what store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a litmus test, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you mean a litmus test?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you get a tincture and tell that you
got a tincture?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but they're all required to be tested
by the state ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can rely on how much is in each
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I've got another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you make your own like a brownie
thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though you're not getting the same
thing for a brownie, if you're doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: over a course, aren't you still getting
the same thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You would.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you happen to get the brownie
that's especially high in THC and that
[SPEAKER_01]: this one's lower in THC, this one you
might get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might feel more high from than you
want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're trying to give yourself
10 milligrams or 5 milligrams of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: and for some reason when you were stirring
it, the THC ended up in this corner,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can end up with a higher amount when
you're doing it at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the capsules, depending again on who
the producer is and what store you're
[SPEAKER_01]: buying it at, will float between $5 and
$10 a capsule, which unfortunately
[SPEAKER_01]: capsules are still pretty high priced,
especially if you want to be taking three
[SPEAKER_01]: a day, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's hope because prices are
continually coming down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational market because there's more
producers and more competition and more
[SPEAKER_01]: people making capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus the companies are learning to be more
efficient and to save their costs as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In contrast, I mentioned earlier that you
can also buy locally because we happen to
[SPEAKER_01]: live on Bashan, where cannabis is
historically our number one cash crop on
[SPEAKER_01]: the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been that way since the 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And love it or hate it, it's been the
truth of the matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have got a lot of good
herbalists on the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there are places on the
island that you can get tincture for as
[SPEAKER_01]: little as $40 a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the important thing though is if you
buy from family or friends or even make
[SPEAKER_01]: your own, I implore you to make sure that
it's laboratory tested for its strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you don't want to have an
experience where either you're making your
[SPEAKER_01]: own tincture and the first time you make
it, it's weak and then you make it again
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's super potent and there's this
disparity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you give yourself a negative
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of medicine is repeatable
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want repeatable results,
you need to know what your variable A is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you make your own or if you buy
it informally on the island or from
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere in the country, make sure that
the person who's producing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the herbalist, has had it tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to make your own,
it's really easy to have your products
[SPEAKER_01]: tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just right over here on the other side of
the ferry at Analytical 360 is a lab that
[SPEAKER_01]: will do testing for any patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need an authorization,
just go in and give them your stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, tell me how strong it is per drop or
squirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody who is any herbalist who's
informally and illegally producing it on
[SPEAKER_01]: the island would be getting it lab tested
as well because that person cares about
[SPEAKER_01]: their patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it legal to grow your own?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is legal to grow your own in
Washington if you have a patient
[SPEAKER_01]: authorization card from your doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your doctor fills out a form that says
that you have one of the corresponding
[SPEAKER_01]: illnesses, they check the box and they
sign it and that piece of paper gives you
[SPEAKER_01]: the right to grow four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you then choose to sign up to the
state's registry of patients, that four
[SPEAKER_01]: plants become six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have your doctor write on the
authorization that you need more plants
[SPEAKER_01]: than what's allowed and you get on the
registry, you can get and grow up to 15
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you talked about some other conditions
like fibromyalgia and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_06]: So your primary care doc might well give
you authorization?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your primary care doc may well.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, there are,
I can't say all, but several of the
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors at the Bashon Clinic give
authorizations and also there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: naturopath that I refer folks to regularly
who's very familiar with cannabis medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: and patients who I can give out his number
to anybody who wants it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must caution you from getting on the
state's registry though if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: preserve your privacy because as we know,
the state is not very good with keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: things secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of all the tens of thousands of
patients there are in Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're only at 14,000 in the entire
state that have signed up for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are mostly people who are doing
it because they want to pay less tax when
[SPEAKER_01]: you buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you become a patient,
you don't have to pay the sales tax.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is it legal to smoke marijuana out
there in the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're technically not supposed to
smoke marijuana in the sight of other
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're supposed to be able to enjoy it
at home or if you're out by yourself in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wilderness.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, you're not even allowed to do
cannabis social clubs in Seattle because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's other people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, do people do it all the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not legal technically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, you're not supposed to do it
in eyesight of other folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the information we get,
can we get that online?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the information that I'm giving you is
from years of experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there probably isn't a particular
place you're going to go online that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have synthesized it all like I
am.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can certainly find out
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can Google Parkinson's and
cannabis and you'll get a slew of
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good part of it will be accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to recommend the website projectcbd
.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a matter of fact, right now on
their homepage, they've got a big thing on
[SPEAKER_01]: Parkinson's and CBD for beginners,
which is an excellent article.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that again is projectcbd.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: The information there is the best of the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their articles are written by people who
know about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, they've got a section on the
website that says conditions and it lists
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 conditions that cannabis can be used
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on Parkinson's, it will take
you to a page of all of the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: science that has been done into cannabis
and Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually read the study,
not someone filtering the information for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I go to learn about dosing
for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't want to read it filtered
through somebody's article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to read the actual scientific study
that was done in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have both on Project CBD's
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have quality articles that are
synthesizing this information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also have the original scientific
papers that you can read as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's it called again?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to make that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can get you a piece of paper and
write it down when we're done here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually going to go over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, hand me your newspaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like she's going to give it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Project CBD is very reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kana?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: The store at Kana, West Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I go in there and ask for a
specialized mix of something, they'll do
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they can't compound like they're
like a pharmacy would.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they will know which of their products
is most appropriate for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to get them out at the
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since you're leaving, let me give you
one of my cards in case you want to ask a
[SPEAKER_01]: follow-up question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also in case you're interested in
being introduced to somebody on the
[SPEAKER_01]: island.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you act as a consultant so they
would actually hire you when you help with
[SPEAKER_00]: the dosage and finding this and the list
on the island?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do this all as volunteer work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make my money through my podcast and
through paid speaking engagements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I teach patients because I think it's
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could you give us the name of the
artist on the list on the island?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the meeting, when it's a little more
one-to-one, I would be happy to tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: more about where you can get it on the
island and who to talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't mind those type of questions
in an email or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't mind those questions in an
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just nothing via Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's not secure for any kind of
health discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's waste-dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before the whole thing with the whole
licensing, all that came, I had my papers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would buy bits of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And somehow, a lot of it never got used.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long does that stuff keep?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's flour itself, like the buds for
smoking, that slowly degrades over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the aroma therapy of it,
the smell of it, is part of the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it degrades over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the flowers will stay really
medicinal for a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is more like tinctures and capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tinctures will be shelf-stable easily a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they'll add additives that make
it less shelf-stable, like if they've
[SPEAKER_01]: added raspberry flavorings or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a very clean medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say, for example, a full cannabis
extract in alcohol in a dark, dark
[SPEAKER_01]: container kept in a dark area or not on
the shelf, that could stay good for two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three years because it stopped degrading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like edibles and capsules,
it depends on what they're made out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once the cannabis is taken out of the
plant and put in alcohol, it becomes very
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf-stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this meet every first Friday?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our first Friday of the month,
yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there any other questions before we
wrap up?
[SPEAKER_06]: It amazes me how much money could be
collected by the government if they made
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana not, you know, you'd have to
have a prescription done and you have to
[SPEAKER_06]: pay for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're paying an awful lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you're making it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could have every school in the United
States back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in our own state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tax it 37% before the sales tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a lot of money being raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, a 37% tax is coming out
of our pockets as patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a drag too because if
they decrease the taxes, patients wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to pay so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of money to be raised in
taxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a festive phone ring you got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well then I'll be around for a few minutes
for questions if anybody has them kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: informally on the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me here and
for letting me share.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
