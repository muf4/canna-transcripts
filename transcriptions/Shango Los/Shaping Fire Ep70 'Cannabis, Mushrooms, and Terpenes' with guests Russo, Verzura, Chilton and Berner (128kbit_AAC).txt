[SPEAKER_04]: Humans have been using various plant
medicines together as blends for as long
[SPEAKER_04]: as there has been medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: A root of this, a twig of that,
a mushroom, maybe add some heat,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we found that we started to heal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over millennia, we refined our process and
got more adept at interacting with the
[SPEAKER_04]: natural world.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the modern day, even people who don't
consider themselves herbalists are
[SPEAKER_04]: becoming quite adept at blending plant and
other medicines together to feel better.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many of my friends are using smoked
cannabis, oral CBD oil, microdosing
[SPEAKER_04]: mushrooms, and have an essential oil
diffuser in their house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gang gang, we often heal in similar ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to learn about cannabis
health, business, and technique
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiently and with good cheer,

[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's episode is different from anything
I've offered before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was recently invited to San Francisco to
moderate a private panel recording on
[SPEAKER_04]: synergistic medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: The panel was entitled Cannabis,
Mushrooms, and Turpenes for Optimum Health
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was produced by Cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not choose the panelists or the
topic, but Cookies reached out because
[SPEAKER_04]: they love shaping fire and I was happy to
go to the Bay Area to participate.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're done recording, I ended up
driving the Pacific Coast Highway down to
[SPEAKER_04]: Southern California alone for a few days
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a pretty nice break from quarantine
here on Vashon Island and allowed me to
[SPEAKER_04]: travel while interacting with less than 15
people the entire week.
[SPEAKER_04]: That drive along the PCH never fails to be
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the episode today is the audio from
that panel recording.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked Cookies if I could publish it as a
shaping fire episode because the insights
[SPEAKER_04]: expressed by these speakers is exceptional
and there's a lot to learn in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there were multiple mics used at
various locations and online and some of
[SPEAKER_04]: us were even outside to be COVID safe,
some of the sound quality is variable.
[SPEAKER_04]: All in all it sounds good though,
so don't let the audio of my speaker
[SPEAKER_04]: introductions get you down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets better really fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope you enjoy this departure from
the regular show format and the great info
[SPEAKER_04]: on blending synergistic natural medicines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi everybody and welcome to today's
roundtable discussion brought to you by
[SPEAKER_04]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our topic for today is cannabis,
mushrooms, and terpenes for optimum
[SPEAKER_04]: health.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am your moderator for today's
discussion, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoy meaningful interviews with
the top minds in cannabis cultivation,
[SPEAKER_04]: solventless extraction, and cannabis
medicine, I invite you to check out my
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast at shapingfire at shapingfire.com
or wherever you get your podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an impressive and eclectic panel
today to talk about synergistic medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the modern era, people are encouraged
to take medical advice only from doctors
[SPEAKER_04]: and the advice patients are usually given
by both doctors is to take pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_04]: company blends of single components
rendered from the plants and other
[SPEAKER_04]: naturally occurring life.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are often what's called for,
but not always.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's discussion will focus on cannabis,
mushrooms, and terpenes and how modern
[SPEAKER_04]: formulators, healers, and citizen
scientists navigate the interplay between
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get to know our speakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So because of the present pandemic,
two of our speakers will be joining us by
[SPEAKER_04]: video feed, which you probably already
figured out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll start there via video link from
Vashon Island, Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Ethan Russo is a world-renowned
neurologist and cannabis researcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is author of several books of cannabis
medicine and has published over 30
[SPEAKER_04]: articles in neurology, pain management,
cannabis, and ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is presently founder of CredoScience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also via video link from Vancouver Island,
British Columbia, Canada is Jeff Chilton.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff has pioneered the development and
manufacture of organic mushroom extracts
[SPEAKER_04]: since 1973.
[SPEAKER_04]: He received a fellowship to the Dutch
School for Mushroom Growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff co-authored and published the classic
best-selling book on small-scale mushroom
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mushroom Cultivator.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is currently founder of Namex Organic
Mushroom Extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here on the set with me, we've got Tony
Verzura.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony founded Blue River Terpenes and
Extracts and is a visionary on the
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction and use of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most recently, Tony has founded ADVESA,
a licensed cannabis processor in
[SPEAKER_04]: California, developing groundbreaking
solvent-less extraction technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony developed these companies as a
mechanism to reach his extraordinary goals
[SPEAKER_04]: as a formulator of modern cannabinoid
blends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And across from me is Berner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Berner is a rapper, songwriter,
and entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is founder and CEO of Cookies,
one of the most influential lifestyle
[SPEAKER_04]: brands in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Berner uses his success and influence to
work with others to bring reliable access
[SPEAKER_04]: to emerging medicines for minority
neighborhoods that are often left out of
[SPEAKER_04]: breakthroughs in healthcare.
[SPEAKER_04]: So welcome to all of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So since we're going to be focused
focusing on blended medicines with
[SPEAKER_04]: synergistic components today, let's start
by establishing their efficacy in history.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Dr. Russo, we're going to start with
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you have studied indigenous and
tribal medicines your whole life and have
[SPEAKER_04]: spent a good amount of time in Peru
working with indigenous people there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a good basis to believe that
humans have combining different plant
[SPEAKER_04]: medicines for thousands of years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly among the Machiganga and all the
tribes in Amazonia, it's common to mix
[SPEAKER_00]: things, particularly the ayahuasca
admixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You necessarily have to have at least two
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get the harmaline alkaloids
from the banisteriopsis vine and the
[SPEAKER_00]: dimethyltryptamine from psychotrial leaves
or other donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are hundreds of plants in the Amazon
that have dimethyltryptamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many other complex mixtures
that they employ.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prototypes that are probably most
familiar to people, though, are
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional Chinese medicine, where you
might have several components that attack
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a multitude of other
components that might deal with the side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects from the main components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mixtures of the norm as opposed to
simples, meaning one ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, on Western tradition,
among the Greeks, there were theriacas,
[SPEAKER_00]: which were often, again, complex mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see this again through Arabic
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those included cannabis,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then coming up to modern times,
let's take a complex problem like cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually is not sufficient to attack one
aspect of the cancer rather you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: attack multiple areas of weakness so that
you get a good tumor kill at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly for something like
leukemia, people get a cocktail of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the example of cannabis,
which is a cocktail of medicines in one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant between the cannabinoids and
terpenoids and potentially other
[SPEAKER_00]: components like the flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it absolutely makes sense to combine
cannabis with other herbal agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beauty of it is that our bodies
are really equal to the task.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used to dealing with these complex
mixtures because a lot of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: would be components of our foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very much the norm as opposed to
Western medicine, where they might
[SPEAKER_00]: identify a target in a receptor and
computer design a molecule to fit there
[SPEAKER_00]: with the highest affinity and highest
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean it won't be toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these natural products, although
there can be things that are toxic and too
[SPEAKER_00]: high a dose or even low doses,
for the most part, our bodies are capable
[SPEAKER_00]: of metabolizing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's usually very little harm
attached.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Jeff, so I know that you have
researched both the history of Chinese
[SPEAKER_04]: medicines as well as interacted with the
indigenous folk in China to learn them
[SPEAKER_04]: firsthand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've probably seen these ancient
mushroom blends that come out of China,
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does Chinese medicine blend mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I think Dr. Russo was
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's there's so many different
aspects to putting these different
[SPEAKER_01]: formulas together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And traditional Chinese medicine,
I mean, it's the perfect example for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what it's kind of based on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will.
[SPEAKER_01]: The traditional Chinese doctor will will
prescribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll he'll diagnose.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will prescribe different herbs that he
believes will will address the particular
[SPEAKER_01]: illness that is present regarding
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they've been used for thousands
of years there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one mushroom in particular,
poriococcos, which is a diuretic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the other things that that
we've found to and what researchers have
[SPEAKER_01]: found is that different mushrooms will
have effects on different tumor systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just say you you wanted to either
prescribe one for as an adjunct to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain tumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in fact, you could put them together
into one particular formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would work in different ways on
on that particular illness that somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: has in terms of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are definitely reasons that you
can blend these together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and certainly when it comes to
triterpenoids, which is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're really looking at, there are over
one hundred and thirty triterpenoids in
[SPEAKER_01]: reishi mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found that specific ones will
have specific activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something, too, that that is
pretty interesting in what you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally agree that that is an
interesting aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, when we talk last time,
I was actually surprised to find out that
[SPEAKER_04]: mushrooms had terpenes as a primarily,
you know, cannabis enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I've talked about and done my
research in triterpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time the mushrooms get to me or at
least the mushrooms that I usually
[SPEAKER_04]: participate in, they kind of they kind of
don't seem to have all that much smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when you smell one that is fresh,
you're like, oh, this is an entirely
[SPEAKER_04]: different experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to be clear, not every every
single species will have triterpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of species in particular
that are famous for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One would be Ganoderma, the reishi
mushroom, and the other would be chaga and
[SPEAKER_01]: reishi is really packed with these
triterpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what gives it its bitter
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the mushrooms do not have
those compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now that we've kind of talked about how
blends have been made throughout human
[SPEAKER_04]: history and we realize that actually
blends blending medicinal properties
[SPEAKER_04]: together is is more the expectation rather
than separating them out and isolating
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk a little bit about what people
do when they blend them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Tony, I'm coming over to you as a
professional formulator and healer.
[SPEAKER_04]: What attributes do you look for when
designing a healing blend or formulation
[SPEAKER_04]: from different components?
[SPEAKER_03]: I subscribe to both what they're talking
about when when you look at Eastern versus
[SPEAKER_03]: Western.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think really, I think the difference
becomes in the pharmaceutical world,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're really keying on like on a
compound, an active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many oftentimes they're creating a
synthetic version of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we look at like what the FDA and
what the world is approving in actual
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine, we look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking at an active compound or
one singular type of molecule that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: isolating and they're utilizing that,
you know, to go through their research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you guys were talking about
there, you're kind of addressing one
[SPEAKER_03]: issue, but then you might actually have a
side effect to another issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you're looking at synergistic
properties of all herbal medicine and you
[SPEAKER_03]: look at what's called grass approved,
that's what Ethan kind of was talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these things are made in earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're made naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you put them into your body,
we're also from the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we put things into our body that
are is, you know, synthetically made,
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't it leaves a footprint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even it's like plaque.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we were to, you know, start printing
3D cannabis, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, well, we know what's in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the cannabinoids, the terpenes,
flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put a computer together and we start
printing that herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're never going to ever, ever capture
all of those compounds that are naturally
[SPEAKER_03]: produced on earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we put those things into our body,
then it leaves footprints and then we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have a sustainable and a very
synergistic type of approach to what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think when you look at the world
of healers and the world of pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_03]: compoundists, they have a completely
different approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a chemist and there's an
alchemist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I don't really subscribe to and I
think there is a place for chemistry and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it has a wonderful place in the
science world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me personally, I'm trying to like
figure out a way to naturally capture
[SPEAKER_03]: what's available in the plant and remove
impurities that are maybe in the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that we don't want to particularly have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that way we can actually do what
the Western world is trying to accomplish,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in a plant-based effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if I look at the plant of cannabis
and burner gives me a particular type of
[SPEAKER_03]: strain, I'm going to look at the
statistics of it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to look at the compounds and
say, okay, this has THCA, CBGA,
[SPEAKER_03]: CBCA, different kinds of actual available
phyto-cannabinoids, and then we'll look at
[SPEAKER_03]: the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're looking at upwards to 300
compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in between that, there's also those
other oils like we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_03]: the flavonoids that also play into these
oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the terpenoids or terpenes,
mainstream cannabis viewers see it,
[SPEAKER_03]: or even terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where when I first started calling
that, everyone was upset because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenoids or terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, well, it's easy for most
people to understand them as terps,
[SPEAKER_03]: but those are really not just the aroma,
not just the flavor, but they're really
[SPEAKER_03]: the catalyst and the effect behind all of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our friend on the panel here inspired
me, by the way, in Taming THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was 2007 when he wrote that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everything I've done has come
from those that came before me that laid
[SPEAKER_03]: the ideology down in front of us that
said, hey, here's a concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: The human body can have an endocannabinoid
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means that we're working off
receptor base in our body, our mind,
[SPEAKER_03]: our body, and our soul has a synergistic
spirit, if you will, we're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do we interact with those?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we want to be able to target that
receptor system as a formulator and try to
[SPEAKER_03]: pull out all the really good parts in
everything we're talking about to then
[SPEAKER_03]: overlay that similar to probably like how
he makes music, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone thinks that you probably have
four tracks, probably hundreds,
[SPEAKER_03]: hundreds of tracks to make sounds and have
this whole thing come together in the same
[SPEAKER_03]: way of beat or songs laid down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at it the same way as how,
how am I going to take the worlds of
[SPEAKER_03]: what's available in this cannabis plant,
what's available in the mushrooms that
[SPEAKER_03]: he's talking about and how do we create
this overlay to create that synergistic
[SPEAKER_03]: natural compound and reaction that we
think is going to do X, Y, and Z.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it probably will do X, Y, and Z,
but there's probably other beneficial
[SPEAKER_03]: things that's tapping into a different
consciousness there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing for anybody who has not
read it, I do recommend that you check out
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Russo's taming THC paper that Tony
just referred to.
[SPEAKER_04]: For many of us, it was the thing that
opened our doors to terpenes and
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding how they interact with our
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's old enough now that it's free
online.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just want to search taming THC and
Dr. Ethan Russo, and you'll find it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it's an actually very readable
paper, even though it's also very legit
[SPEAKER_04]: science.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that you said,
Tony, that I want to follow up on is I
[SPEAKER_04]: like this elegant delineation that you
make between chemistry and alchemy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas one, you're, you're trying to
reduce things and spread them apart and
[SPEAKER_04]: break them apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas with alchemy, you're trying to
bring essential essences together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they sound like they could be very
similar, but they're certainly different
[SPEAKER_04]: in intention.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as we look at different
extraction technologies and separation
[SPEAKER_04]: technologies like solventless,
we also learned that the effect of the
[SPEAKER_04]: final medicine is drastically different,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there, I can't, I can't really imagine
what would be a rule of thumb,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I figured I'll ask you for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any, any like a borderline or
delineation that you come up against where
[SPEAKER_04]: you're like, oh, I'm, I'm drifting from
alchemy into chemistry and that's not the
[SPEAKER_04]: direction I want to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you know if you're, if you're
thinking too chemistry minded?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't have a chemistry degree,
so I don't, I don't, I don't know how to
[SPEAKER_03]: use chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's where everyone,
you know, gets to that roadblock.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I have no choice, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just don't, you know, I feel like I
have counter partners in the industry that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a few individuals out there that
seem to be following in the same path that
[SPEAKER_03]: I, and where I'm at, where it's like,
how do we, how do we break this thing
[SPEAKER_03]: down, but retain what's there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I do feel there are people out
there that use chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from a molecular standpoint,
we get into these debates all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, Hey, if I've got this
solventless THCA that tests 99% and
[SPEAKER_03]: someone says, well, I have this chemical
THC that tests 99%.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no residuals left.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no footprint left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the same thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: The answer is in short, it is,
you know, it is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how we get there is, is important,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's, and, and all of the,
ultimately how we're utilizing that and
[SPEAKER_03]: what we're doing to get to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So does it have an environmental impact?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's something that I look at and
a lot of people don't really understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm using a chemical to extract
something from a plant, what happens to
[SPEAKER_03]: that plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the, what's left in that plant for
that particular chemical?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it reintroduced into earth?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are we being able to capture everything
from that actual plant and use everything
[SPEAKER_03]: in every part of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that maybe is where you're
going with this because outcome to me is
[SPEAKER_03]: how do I use, I think we kind of had a
conversation once about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we, how do we use everything from
that flower without creating pollution or
[SPEAKER_03]: an environmental effect?
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to break this apart, but every
part has a use, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to just focus on,
Hey, I want this THC from this cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's throw the rest away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I used ethanol or I used butane or
something like that, now we've kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: created the next problem, which comes back
to like this medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does it, what does it take to make
that synthetic opioid in the process of
[SPEAKER_03]: making that just to make that particular
pill or that fentanyl, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've done a great job making a
synthetic, but then what did they do in
[SPEAKER_03]: the process of making that and what kind
of environmental impact?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it doesn't just come down to a
chemical versus mechanical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes down to a consciousness of what
you're, what you're making.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then how do we make both the impact on
the human and on us, on this planet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for breaking that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Bernard, you've spent a lot of time
with what I'll call citizen scientists,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: People who may or may not have the
degrees, but they are experimenting with
[SPEAKER_04]: good intention to make either medicinal or
recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's a pretty blurry line
too, but, but you work a lot with citizen
[SPEAKER_04]: scientists, cannabis breeders and
psychonauts too, who experiment with the
[SPEAKER_04]: body by ingesting, you know, all sorts of
things and substances, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you and other citizen researchers
look for when combining healing or
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational drugs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's important for people
to understand that even if they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: into a recreational store to buy cannabis
and smoke it, it's still a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the biggest message we try
to get across is that this is something
[SPEAKER_02]: that helps in so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you may be smoking weed and a lot of
people, a lot of friends I've met,
[SPEAKER_02]: or a lot of people that I've hung out with
along the way, they don't really realize
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're using it as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: To them, they're just getting high.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of healing their pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're enjoying the taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so much of that, that, that plant
medicine is important for a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It unifies people, it brings people
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And furthermore, it helps a lot more than
some of the pharmaceutical medicines out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think, I think it's pretty
interesting because we have a voice and a
[SPEAKER_02]: platform to educate that this is a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, you know, I was in the
proposition to 15 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've been doing this
legally since I was 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've personally saw firsthand off duty
cops coming in and buying cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: lawyers and teachers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made me really realize that,
you know, when it went wreck, that we
[SPEAKER_02]: shouldn't lose that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shouldn't lose that message that this
is a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, where I grew up working at,
there was a lounge here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially people would be able to
come in and buy their herb and they'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to blaze and just that, that
releasing of the mental anguish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if someone was coming from the VA and
they've had a really bad time and they
[SPEAKER_02]: just wanted to come in there, not just the
medicine, but the way that people bond
[SPEAKER_02]: around the herb is super, super healthy,
is good for the mind, it's good for people
[SPEAKER_02]: in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I feel like the people I'm
around, and the people I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: educate is that no matter if it's
recreational or not, no matter if you
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy smoking butter or not, it still is a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's helping you with anxiety,
depression, you're celebrating,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're mourning, you're helping with your
appetite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's important to kind of get
that message across that this is still a
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine, whether it be recreational or
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of us don't even realize sometimes
that we're, we are taking it for medicinal
[SPEAKER_04]: reasons, even though in our head we're
doing it for recreation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, you may, you may think that
you're smoking the herb because you like
[SPEAKER_02]: the way it tastes and, you know,
it puts a smile on your face, but there
[SPEAKER_02]: you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It puts a smile on your face and,
you know, happiness is everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially during COVID and what's going
on in the world right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more smiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more good vibes and good energy,
more unity.
[SPEAKER_02]: People need to love people more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just kind of what we do,
why we do what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, heck, if at its very basis,
being in a good mood and being joyful
[SPEAKER_04]: boosts our immune system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if, if, you know, using cannabis,
can help get us there, well, let's go for
[SPEAKER_04]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The price of peace of mind, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a quick story, I was in Colorado once
and I was in the medical world and it
[SPEAKER_03]: turned into the rec and you said it was
kind of a gray line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was, I was really down because I
spent a lot of time there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent a lot of time with patients and
trying to help people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I too was behind the bar every single
day, if you will, and getting to know
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw people coming in and we helped a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it went to recreational, I kind of
got down and I actually came out to the
[SPEAKER_03]: Bay area and I always looked up to you and
what you guys were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he started with, you know,
one, one spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I came out and I was like,
Oh man, cookies is still keeping it real.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still with the people and the
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I left that, that whole entire
industry for nothing behind me because of
[SPEAKER_03]: an adult use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was thinking, I had that chip on my
shoulders, recreational, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then it just had that awakening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in the Bay and the community here and
the people that were behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has something, you know, it's not just
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how it brings people together and
then how we take care of each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a certain community that comes
behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I started to have a much different
approach to it and realized exactly what,
[SPEAKER_03]: what Berner is saying is that I don't even
like the word anymore, recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just responsible adult use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's full access for anyone that's
21 and up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we don't have to have an excuse to
say, you need to go see a doctor before we
[SPEAKER_03]: can come talk to you about getting
whatever herb makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it is a nerve and it is a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the diversity of this
conversation right here, we all have
[SPEAKER_02]: different walks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all come from different walks of life,
but we're united on this conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably wouldn't be speaking to you if
it wasn't for cannabis, vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: These gentlemen are super educated and
been doing this for a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're all coming together in this
conversation because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I still do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there is this, this sometimes not so
subtle mindset from the, from the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: days where a lot of people honestly were
kind of sketched about going into some of
[SPEAKER_04]: those stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once you were inside, it was a very
loving, homey, huggy, good environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then nowadays the adult use stores are
very, you know, they've got a lot more
[SPEAKER_04]: money behind them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're, they're very, they're very
shiny and people are being programmed more
[SPEAKER_04]: for the recreational mindset.
[SPEAKER_04]: By, by, you know, media.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet they can still get a huge variety
of quality flowers often.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's got a good existence as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you see that may have been lost in
the transition from medical dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of more grungy, lovey days to this
cleaner, but maybe more commoditized
[SPEAKER_04]: environment that, that we might want to
encourage to bring back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when, when you used to come into a
medical dispensary, it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like taxi cab confessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would come in, you'd be able to
show them the herb out the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they, they could smell it, they could
pick it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a way more personable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get to know what they like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can recommend things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might even give us on a bong here and
let them taste it for their purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the way that we're doing
cookies right now, I encourage people to
[SPEAKER_02]: do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you step into my store, I still want to
greet you right away and have iPad and
[SPEAKER_02]: they walk with you to the flower menu and
they're kind of going through and talking
[SPEAKER_02]: to you about each and everything that you
want to know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're educating you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're giving their personal opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, when that customer is done
with that bud tender, then they go to get
[SPEAKER_02]: checked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So point being is the personal experience
hands on, you come to some of these flashy
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a menu on the wall and you kind
of get in line and you kind of just put
[SPEAKER_02]: your order and you bounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as personable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what we're doing with the cookie
store is we kind of created a huddle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe a lot of good things happen in a
huddle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got the flower table is round and
people are sitting around that flower
[SPEAKER_02]: table and just like this, I'm smelling
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're seeing my reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing your reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The personable experience with people
working with people still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're doing with our
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I encourage people when you open a
dispensary, keep the customer in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I said, you know,
someone may be coming from the VA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be coming from the hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might have a terrible day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to give them your full attention
and kind of make it more personable,
[SPEAKER_02]: not so in and out, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why we chose the dispensary
stuff the way we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of keep that good personable
interaction in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would say that because I've gone
through that experience, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that you say that, I do see that
being the difference in what's going on in
[SPEAKER_03]: those stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I see how you took that from the
medical side, because you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of stores out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just got their counters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before, when it was medical,
it was that cheers kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can tell you that being behind the
bar at times where it was just a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: registers and you wanted to wrap with
someone and talk to them, everyone else
[SPEAKER_03]: had to wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that actually wasn't the most
efficient way to help someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now looking at thinking about what you
just said, and you're right, because I
[SPEAKER_03]: came into the store and I'm like,
oh, this is kind of neat because this
[SPEAKER_03]: person did come with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I don't know what flowers I
need to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came in with my wife, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And she loves all the cookies flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, oh, she's very particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: She wants to smell everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: She wants to know about everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: She wants to know everything there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realized that that first experience
is like, oh, this is very personal.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the sense that we had someone that
catered to us and we were looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: everything and they weren't transactional.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't there for the transaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were there for the education.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was like, okay, then you get
in line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do think he's got the right vibe
there and the right mentality in the sense
[SPEAKER_03]: that that's how the store looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a lot more bells and whistles
behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot more products there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's that touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for us, I have a duality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people know me as Blue River.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look at that as my top shelf
extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, how far can I push the world
and the boundaries of solventless?
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, that was always like the products
that we'd inhale.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my push for what can I do in the
adult use world?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everyone that says to me,
oh, well, that product is so expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a patient, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where this other product line that
I created with the base of wellness was
[SPEAKER_03]: capsules, sublinguals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Topicals, you know, creating CBN and these
different things because I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, if we're really hurting and you want
something affordable, let's switch you
[SPEAKER_03]: over to a different delivery method with a
different price point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do carry both wide ranges of
these products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that, you know, if you're open
and dispensary, it's not just about the
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers or the extracts, but make sure you
also still carry the medicinal products
[SPEAKER_03]: too, because there are people that are
looking for them.
Amen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I hadn't thought about that,
about how the cookie stores are designed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I experienced that at the Cookies Geodesic
Dome at Emerald Cup last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just generally liked how you go in one
side and out the other side.
[SPEAKER_04]: But inside there's all these like little
kiosks where people can mill around and
[SPEAKER_04]: learn and ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They create a conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people that like herbs or like
to smoke, they want to understand other
[SPEAKER_02]: people's experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that conversation is priceless.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in two, 15 days, that's what we know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I loved about my job is
talking to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the jar, if you see the jars that we
designed, it's so you can pick it up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can look at it, you can twist it,
you can smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though you can't do a deli style at a
big jar anymore, we created a jar custom
[SPEAKER_02]: for our store so people actually see what
they're, they can actually see it clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can still be hands on a little bit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Clutch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I saw that, I really missed the days
of the mason jars and sticking your nose
[SPEAKER_04]: in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're probably away from those days
forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we got to be creative about new ways
for people to be able to shop with their
[SPEAKER_03]: nose again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and real quick, you remember that,
like I used to open those big jars,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'd shake them up and kind of like,
so if you think about what that just did,
[SPEAKER_03]: was that I don't want to sell the product
from that jar that I've opened all day
[SPEAKER_03]: long.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all the broken trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially what's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you want to get your like look
at the sample, but let me buy something
[SPEAKER_03]: brand new and sealed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's also another really good
touch that you guys do that I think is
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a short break and be
right back.

[SPEAKER_04]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_04]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trouble with growing in new soils or
blended cocoa substrates is that it takes
[SPEAKER_04]: most of the plant's life just to create
these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_04]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's three times the concentration of
the current leading brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: This new product called Dynomyco is the
result of 30 years of research and trials
[SPEAKER_04]: at the Volcani Agriculture Research
Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has also been vigorously tried by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: since the product first arrived here last
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may have already even heard about
Dynomyco by its original name,
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynomike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Dynomyco is available at grow shops
and online in the United States for the
[SPEAKER_04]: first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of mycelium networks in the soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also as a biostimulant to make clone
cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see side by sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_04]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco at
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynomyco.com and find out where you can
get yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots, or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_04]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our guests this week are Dr. Ethan
Russo, Tony Verzura, Jeff Chilton,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Berner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's return to the panel discussion now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jeff, the medicinal and psychedelic
mushrooms are becoming increasingly
[SPEAKER_04]: popular in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: and throughout the world, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can buy tincture and concoctions
like nearly everywhere, including like
[SPEAKER_04]: some gas stations even, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so strange to see medicinal
non-psychedelic mushrooms at a gas
[SPEAKER_04]: station.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of that, there's a wide variety of
qualities and price points of medicinal
[SPEAKER_04]: mushrooms now, even though we know that
they've got varying amounts of medicinal
[SPEAKER_04]: qualities to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: What attributes do we want our medicinal
non-psychedelic mushrooms to exhibit so we
[SPEAKER_04]: know they will be potent and have a
positive effect on our lives?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, one of the biggest issues
in this category right now is the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of the products out there are
not actually even mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this speaks to,
you know, like with cannabis, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are multiple parts of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the roots, you've got the
leaves, you've got the flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and each one of those is going to have a
certain chemical profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's no different with mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we call a mushroom is actually a
fungal organism that's got what I call
[SPEAKER_01]: three plant parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mushrooms don't have seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you grow a mushroom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, mushrooms have spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spores will germinate into a fine
filament called a hypha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those hypha come together and produce
what's called a mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the actual body of this organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: When conditions are right, it will produce
a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that mushroom will grow up,
mature, it'll produce spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a completion of the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got three plant parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got spore, we've got mycelium,
and we've got mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the mushroom is what's traditionally
been used as medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mushroom's very complex on what it
can actually produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are actually products out there
where they grow the mycelium, but they
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it on a sterilized grain in a
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the process,
once the grain has been covered with the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium, they will actually dry it,
grow it, grind it to a powder grain and
[SPEAKER_01]: all, and sell it as mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of the key issues out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it gets back to would somebody want
to be selling a cannabis product and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just grinding up leaves and
saying, hey, I've got these great joints
[SPEAKER_01]: of pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, no, no, of course
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's something maybe in the 60s
we might come across, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody would say, hey, I got this great
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh yeah, tastes pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this really, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what's going on right now in
the medicinal mushroom category.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are products out there that are not
mushroom, yet they're being sold as
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are mostly starch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I'd like to stress
here too is that what I love, and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys do too, and that is analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's one of the things that
cannabis is really built on is analyzing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was something in the mushroom
category that was nonexistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five years ago, where maybe they wouldn't
be measuring what are called
[SPEAKER_01]: polysaccharides, when in fact
polysaccharides can also be the starches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these products that are manufactured
on this grain, well, grain is a
[SPEAKER_01]: polysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have tests for beta-glucans that can
demonstrate that we've got the compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: in there that are actually important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the compounds that provide the
medicinal benefits, the immunological
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: These myceliated grain products are mostly
starch with very low amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: beta-glucans.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know what tempeh is, that's
actually what's being ground up to a
[SPEAKER_01]: powder and sold as mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you hear people out there touting
mycelium, basically, mycelium is good on
[SPEAKER_01]: its own, not quite as good as the
mushroom, but it's sometimes spoken about
[SPEAKER_01]: or being sold, but it's on this grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a carrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, that's the key thing that you
have to look for when you're out there
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for a mushroom product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And primarily look and see whether they're
analyzing for the beta-glucans,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's the important compound you
want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they say polysaccharides, well,
forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably one of these other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you'll have a really high number
of polysaccharides, but that's because the
[SPEAKER_01]: product is mostly starch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we love to analyze.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about four different compounds
that we analyze for every single lot that
[SPEAKER_01]: we produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be beta-glucans, alpha-glucans,
ergosterol, ergothionine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to meet that profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you're talking about,
let's for example, triterpenoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've reached a point now where we can
actually analyze for up to 20 of these
[SPEAKER_01]: triterpenoids and get a much more robust
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of like the future of
analysis for us when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_01]: reishi mushroom or chaga to where now
we've got this amazing profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: much like you guys have these profiles of
the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just a whole new universe for
us in terms of as we move forward and
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to actually have this type of
profile for our reishi, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to make it really clear that it
doesn't matter really whether we're
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about cannabis or mushrooms or
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many people trying to do it
different ways and so many of them are
[SPEAKER_04]: being motivated by the dollar that it's
important to always do your homework,
[SPEAKER_04]: to make sure that the products that you're
blending together are good products to
[SPEAKER_04]: begin with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are still at a point in this market
where no matter what you're buying,
[SPEAKER_04]: you will be rewarded by doing your
homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact of the matter is that
adulteration has been with us since the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just a fact of life out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't really matter what herbal
product it is, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adulteration is out there and always will
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like in the world of cannabis
versus mushrooms, it's interesting as he
[SPEAKER_03]: was describing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like from our side, we see this as the
trichomes develop as first little stalks
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they get that little mushroom
head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from an extractor side, it's like,
I can't extract if I don't have the
[SPEAKER_03]: mushroom head, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, so what he's basically saying
in my kind of world is that he's saying
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's people out there that aren't
even getting to the resin gland.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just growing the little stalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not even doing it on the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing it on some other,
like on a yeast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you hear like, oh, someone's
growing like THC on yeast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like apples and oranges here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like two different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's interesting because he's got a
big macro mushroom head and we're looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for those little micro mushroom heads
because that's where all the nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: dense base is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also looked at your testing when he
was talking about the testing things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also big in the testing and reviving
and identifying a certificate of analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have been like FDA approved since
like 90 something, like 96 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody actually gets FDA approved in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly not in our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's FDA laboratories that you
could have things analyzed by.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not FDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're certified organic since 19.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my company has been certified
organic since 1993.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I totally believe in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you were talking before about how
something is produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mushrooms are produced as naturally as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the key things about it is we
produce them on natural substrates and
[SPEAKER_01]: most medicinal mushrooms, for example,
grow on wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we use to grow our mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the wood is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the precursors necessary to
produce those medicinal compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it is something where,
and the whole process, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're finished, that wood that the
mushroom has been growing on, now that
[SPEAKER_01]: gets to be recycled onto the fields as an
adjuvant to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, they dry out that wood
block that the mushroom has come off of
[SPEAKER_01]: and they use it as fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very little waste in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, mushrooms generally are
growing on agricultural waste products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're an amazing organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, can you imagine straw and sawdust
and everything else that's out there after
[SPEAKER_01]: growing all of the foods that we eat or
the timber that we're using?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what do you do with all that
material?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, feed it to the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will love you for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will produce you a good food or a good
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, and this is it, the mushroom is
an organism, this fungal organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It repurposes organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's part of what it's doing out
there in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that, the leaves, the perennial
annual plants that grow up and die every
[SPEAKER_01]: year, the wood that falls down,
repurposing it into humus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's move on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Ethan, terpenes like mushrooms are also
vastly increasing in popularity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, a great deal of the credit
for people's interest in terpenes goes to
[SPEAKER_04]: your milestone paper that we've already
talked about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Humans have been using terpenes for
healing and romance for ages.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the different ways that we can
consume terpenes and what is the mode they
[SPEAKER_04]: use to influence our human functioning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's start at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes come in different flavors that
relate to the number of carbon atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, we're usually talking about
monoterpenoids with 10 carbons,
[SPEAKER_00]: sesquiterpenoids with 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a single diterpenoid, which is
phytol that's only present after drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are triterpenoids,
but only in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that cannabis roots
and the medicinal mushrooms have in
[SPEAKER_00]: common.
[SPEAKER_00]: The monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids
are what give cannabis its specific aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may be surprised to learn that the
cannabinoids themselves are odorless.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a bucketful of pure THC and
there'd be no aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they're really doing is
synergizing with the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: modulating their effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can come in different flavors,
but mainly we think in terms of modulating
[SPEAKER_00]: the psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, when there's too much of it,
produces anxiety rather than alleviating
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that can be modified by other
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, both pineine from pine nuts
and limonene from lemons or other citrus
[SPEAKER_00]: were noticed to be good for people who
would overindulge with hashish or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are agents like linalool,
which we don't see as much of as we should
[SPEAKER_00]: have in most chemovars, chemical varieties
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very powerful anti-anxiety
agent without being overtly sedating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just a few examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But additionally, synergy includes the
ability to contribute to the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example there is karyophylline,
which works on what's called the CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the non-psychoactive receptor that
also is a pain reliever, an analgesic
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor, an anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a lot of karyophylline will
contribute to its ability to treat pain or
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation without adding to the high,
which often isn't necessary because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's plenty of THC around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Ethan, while we have you and while we
have the audience's attention,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to give you the platform to
speak on one of my favorite topics that
[SPEAKER_04]: you speak on, which is so much of the
consumer market is trying to get the most
[SPEAKER_04]: bang for their buck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they go and they are shopping for
the highest percentage of terpene that a
[SPEAKER_04]: laboratory will say they have,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: THC?
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: The highest THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So would you explain how, as far as the
experience goes, the higher the THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: it means a lower terpene profile and how
we want to get that more into balance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it may, particularly with
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about vape pens,
you'll often see that there could be as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as 90% THC or mixed cannabinoids and
leaves very little room for the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the problems that we're seeing is a
lot of the CO2 extraction, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, is done in a way that it really
squanders the terpenoid content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it resembles nothing like the fresh
flower from which it was derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really a shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would advocate to people that the number
on the THC is not really that important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always get more by an additional
inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a little bit more orally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you really are looking for is the
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what bud tenders should be
asking consumers is, what are you trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not how high do you want to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are they doing this to treat
anxiety?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they doing this because they need to
clean the garage and cut the boredom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is, there is a terpenoid
profile that's going to enhance the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really would underline that word
enhance three times because that is really
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this message that just smoking as
much THC as we can without understanding
[SPEAKER_04]: that terpenes sculpt the high is one of
the most important consumer messages that
[SPEAKER_04]: we as a group of folks trying to produce
medicine and educate people can say.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for weighing in on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to jump in if that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, when when Nevada first
opened up and Washington first opened up,
[SPEAKER_02]: people are coming in and buying strictly
on the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the best herb I've ever smoked
might be 16, 17 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the terpenes and the cannabinoids and
everything else in it make it so much
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, you know, urging everyone else
that's watching this, just like you said,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so much more that goes into some
good herb that will do a lot more for your
[SPEAKER_02]: body than the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, me and my friends joke about
it's the guy that wants to go get the
[SPEAKER_02]: thickest burger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not be the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's big.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what are you looking to get?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want a tasty burger?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to enjoy your so THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people shopping for just a THC
number is just not the best idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much more that goes into a
plant that makes it special and that helps
[SPEAKER_02]: your body and makes you enjoy that smoke
than just a THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been a let me get a 30 percent
THC guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let me get the best smelling the
most year for the best, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the best looking for for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's so much more that goes
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad you touched on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because yeah, I like jumping on that,
too, because there's a big misconception
[SPEAKER_03]: with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I subscribe to exactly what both these
guys are saying in the sense that
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere along the line, the consumer has
got it in their mind that the highest THC
[SPEAKER_03]: is the best bang for the buck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is this is the latest thing in
the last definitely couple of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the worst thing because I just don't
understand where it came from,
[SPEAKER_03]: because ultimately our bio essay like what
we go to smell that we want the consumers
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, at least for me for 20
years, smoking cannabis, it's what does it
[SPEAKER_03]: smell like?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it taste like?
[SPEAKER_03]: And most importantly, what's the effect on
your body?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the effect that I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I can tell you from the extract
side, and I am I'm a terpene hunter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not so much about the terms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I'm sitting here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we do projects together,
because they're creating terpene flavors
[SPEAKER_03]: that are mimic things in life that we're
used to that we're like familiar with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think when you take the brain and
somebody is a consumer and like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I smell something like this gelato or this
cookie or this type of lemon cello,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's like it's like a
familiarity that like I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smell this somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recognize this, but it also has that
cannabis, you know, smell too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what's the effect?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he nailed it about the different types
of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately, this is where I kind of
geek out with extracts when someone says,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, the flan or the Toronto, like I come
up with names that are are these like
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar to desserts based on their
textures.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's actually what I'm doing with my
signature extracts is I'm modulating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because of him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I take a solvents extract,
I'm like, am I once I'm able to get THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: a THC, the full spectrum, all of the
terpenes and remove all the lipids and
[SPEAKER_03]: waxes and cellulose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can say to myself, well,
now I'm going to I'm going to build a
[SPEAKER_03]: designer dab here for an effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I deal with Rosin,
that's to me a full spectrum effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I do a Torrone and that's like
cleaning it up a little bit like he's
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about the burger.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm actually overlaying certain things
to create a modulation effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the flan is the most, most modulation
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm actually able to like look at
something and target something in most of
[SPEAKER_03]: our extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what we're known for is
everyone's averaging extract is like three
[SPEAKER_03]: to five percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've had this conversation before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to reintroduce anything if
it's already in the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of times where we would
do like cookies extracts and someone's
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, that's 15 or 20 percent
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like they didn't need a
reintroduction if the terps are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and that's your that's what I always
call the volume knob.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so like we all watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure these guys are familiar with
spinal tap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember as a kid, I was like,
those dudes got amps that go to 11.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like, well, can I get it to 15?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm doing as a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, can I get this thing any louder?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has nothing to do with the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't go to the bar and order
Everclear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get you get a Chopin or a Hennessy or,
you know, a nice bourbon or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not saying give me Everclear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get I want to get as drunk as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the drink you enjoy that tastes
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's that's part of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he also has a another paper out
there maybe that you did once upon a time
[SPEAKER_03]: with another company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was you that they had a study
about just pure THC without terpenes and
[SPEAKER_03]: what that effect was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we looked at I think then,
you know, there's other papers about
[SPEAKER_03]: synthetic THC and how it relates to pain
and just pure THC, like he was saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't have a smell, doesn't have a
flavor, doesn't have a lot of medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only when you start adding these like
nuances of terpenoids and you start
[SPEAKER_03]: building those profiles that we start to
see a real medicinal effect from anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another great thing, too, it was when
people start purchasing based on terpenes,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to change the dynamic of the
market because right now it's strange to
[SPEAKER_04]: think that consumers are buying cannabis
based on what company could influence
[SPEAKER_04]: their local analytical lab to give them a
higher percentage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, oh, gosh, you know, we all know that
that's a problem in the industry right
[SPEAKER_04]: now, whereas I would much rather people
are buying based on what companies are
[SPEAKER_04]: able to treat their flower well,
not cause the terpenes to volatilize off
[SPEAKER_04]: and who's using good genetics to begin
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where our emphasis
should be instead of what lab we happen to
[SPEAKER_04]: use and what influence we have over them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So moving on, we're going to come back to
you, Tony.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you were just talking about the really
high quality terpenes at good numbers that
[SPEAKER_04]: give a really great experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about the other side
now, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because since we're talking about quality,
we should talk about what happens to lower
[SPEAKER_04]: quality terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we're considering synergistic
medicinal compounds, we have to be aware
[SPEAKER_04]: of how quickly terpenes degrade,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are some of the causes to terpene
degradation and what is left when a
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene degrades?
[SPEAKER_03]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we touched, Russo touched upon this a
little earlier, monoterpenes and
[SPEAKER_03]: sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately in the world of cannabis,
this is live fresh frozen, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: When the plant is alive, it's got a real
high abundancy of monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say it's probably got about 80
percent of the full profiles of
[SPEAKER_03]: monoterpene when it's alive and on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you disagree, I have no problems
you correcting me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from my experience, when the plant's
alive and it's cut down, if it's quickly
[SPEAKER_03]: frozen, we're going to have a lot of
monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were to cut that plant down and
naturally dry it, traditionally dry it for
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking, we start to see that we go from
lots of monoterpenes and they're volatile
[SPEAKER_03]: at room temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people that are carrying their
cannabis, they try to keep it around 60,
[SPEAKER_03]: 65 if they know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They keep it at a certain humidity because
they're like trying to preserve the flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: in it as they're trying to cure it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's say if you kind of got a little
warmer or you let it dry, some people sun
[SPEAKER_03]: drying it back in the day, you would start
to see this monoterpene from it being
[SPEAKER_03]: alive to when it's completely dried and
cured.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start to see less of that and more
sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually started in 2015 extracting
fresh, frozen, live monoterpenes from
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would extract terpenes of
sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw clearly two different pathways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, and we kind of educate people
as well, we have different vape carts that
[SPEAKER_03]: are dried and cured and more sesquiterpene
based.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ones that are live are going to be
more monoterpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one tastes very fresh like the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those trichome heads are not oxidized
and they're retained at low temperatures
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what ends up happening is that I
think those that are traditional smokers
[SPEAKER_03]: tend to actually like the dried
sesquiterpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've given 10 people out the live
cart and I give people out the cured cart
[SPEAKER_03]: if they didn't look at it, because it
obviously looks different.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just did a blind test.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd be like, if they're a smoker,
they're going to hit that cart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, wow, that tastes just
like the herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that are desiring those fresher
monoterpenes are going to be looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: like this totally different, real plant
live taste and feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they evaporate very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those that are making live extracts
have a shelf life problem, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the product goes onto the shelf
and they have a live rosin and they say,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, here's what it looked like and it
looked cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the picture, it can quickly dry up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what you end up happening,
this could actually use to your advantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And back in the day, I would be able to
utilize monoterpenes for a
[SPEAKER_03]: recrystallization or a precipitation of
CBD or THCA or different things to
[SPEAKER_03]: precipitate out from a base of all these
other cannabinoids, allowing the terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: to evaporate.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was like kind of what I was doing a
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't do that anymore, but I learned
that like you said, how do we capture
[SPEAKER_03]: these beneficials in monoterpenes without
letting them just fly off into the air?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that is like where I started doing
these like different extracts and flans
[SPEAKER_03]: and jellies and things where how do I
break this apart and then utilize active
[SPEAKER_03]: THC and raw THCA and those terpenes and
create almost a natural preservative
[SPEAKER_03]: within those actual extracts to hold and
trap those together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then obviously the next transition
was, well, I need to be able to powderize
[SPEAKER_03]: this or put this into a suspension of a
liquid and then be able to retain it as
[SPEAKER_03]: real medicine, which then gets into a
capsule.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that that is the biggest
challenge is being able to capture those
[SPEAKER_03]: from the cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I really liked about with Jeff
and what he was talking about,
[SPEAKER_03]: and as I researched his company was the
other group of terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, and I learned something today,
which another chapter will open in my mind
[SPEAKER_03]: because of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: About the roots of cannabis and these
mushrooms having the same terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm going to start making terpenes
from roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what I realized is that he's
making a pure product.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing the same thing on our side.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a 10 to one ratio and he's being able
to get these very heavy concentrations of
[SPEAKER_03]: that terpene concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't even know what that synergistic
effect is yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We start laying these cannabinoids on,
we start laying these terpenoids on from
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm able to preserve those,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm able to overlay them like we were
talking about earlier with the terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: that's coming from his mushrooms,
because he's using the purest form of it
[SPEAKER_03]: and he's getting the highest
concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an unknown synergistic effect that
excites me.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Burner, you've worked extensively in
the cannabis community to curate flowers
[SPEAKER_04]: that have an attractive aroma and desiring
healing effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you learned from consumers about
what they actually look for in a terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: They love the fruity, foodie type smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: We came out with cherry pie, Sunset
Sherbert, Gelato, Biscotti.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food kind of flavor profile,
the sweet, the kind of sweet and gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: People love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I curate our menus and encourage our
breeders to go strictly for flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not really hunting for the biggest
yielding plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not really hunting for the most THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going for the most enjoyable smoke
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is now recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be able to enjoy your smoke as
much as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we look for and what I've seen
people react to more than anything is the
[SPEAKER_02]: good smelling, the good tasting flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of got a hype around flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exotics is what they call them.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are really into OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really into the hazes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're into the train wrecks and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once we introduced this certain flavor
profile that was sweet and very aromatic
[SPEAKER_02]: and would leave like a soap, pissy smell
in the air, it became a huge, huge hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that our customer base is
looking for a flavor over everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got two follow ups on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one is in your experience,
are do people, are they aware that there
[SPEAKER_04]: is terpenes, that the terpenes are playing
a role in what they like?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they are buying with their nose and
they're familiar with the vocabulary of
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are most people all like, oh,
this is the gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smell the gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the gelato without ever actually
thinking about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think there's not a lot of
education around terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they mentioned earlier, people are
shopping for THC, but there's no denying
[SPEAKER_02]: that nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pop open that jar and that's why we
created the jar the way we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you smell it, I mean, it's like when
you smell some good home cooking,
[SPEAKER_02]: you smell a restaurant walking down the
street, your nose doesn't lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that people are just shopping
based on what they're smelling,
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that hopefully after people
watch this, they're educated on actually
[SPEAKER_02]: how big of a role terpenes play in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second follow up is, you know,
you've got a long breadth of experience
[SPEAKER_04]: with curating for the public, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you're saying, the things that
people are most attracted to at this point
[SPEAKER_04]: in the market are sweet smelling,
food reminiscent things that have got some
[SPEAKER_04]: gas to them, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree, I like those as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also like a lot of the cultivars
that we used to get that were rank,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They smelled like baby diapers or rotting
flesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or some of this really gross stuff that,
but that when you taste it, you're all
[SPEAKER_04]: like, that gross thing is so delightful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the buzz is so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that with a consumer driven
market, we're going to lose those old
[SPEAKER_04]: nasty, beautiful things?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially because I got a breeding
project going on at my house right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm bringing all those old school
gases back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I named Cheetah Piss
Cheetah Piss to kind of get the consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: away from looking for the, you know,
ice cream cake or the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the fruit roll up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done that for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm bringing back the gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm breeding myself personally,
and this is the first time I've actually
[SPEAKER_02]: done my own breeding project, instead of,
you know, art directing a breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: project, I'm bringing straight gas back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's going to be a lot of baby
diaper and, you know, a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: burnt rubber kind of vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, as a pie head, you want to
have a variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have a lot of different
tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my goal is to keep that alive and to
educate, you know, our customers while I
[SPEAKER_02]: still got a good voice and platform that
there's so much more out there than the
[SPEAKER_02]: fruity stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these old school gases and the
super skunks and the kind of musty dirty
[SPEAKER_02]: sock smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very different high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it may smell crazy, but when you
smoke it, it's just, you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: wow, that's, that's gym socks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, so I'm into bringing that
back to life for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Ethan, I'd love to get your thoughts on
this too, you know, as, as thinking about
[SPEAKER_04]: the medicinal nature of terpenes and
people are often very attracted to these,
[SPEAKER_04]: these sweet terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything that you might have to
add about the medicinal benefits of these,
[SPEAKER_04]: these smells that we would normally
consider gross, but as you develop a
[SPEAKER_04]: connoisseurs palette for cannabis,
you actually find yourself very attracted
[SPEAKER_04]: to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't deny that that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really depends on the blend,
the proportions of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funny thing about terpenoids is a
trace component may really totally alter
[SPEAKER_00]: the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with these complex mixtures,
once there's more than three terpenoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really hard for anyone, even
experienced people that really have an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I use the comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we blindfold somebody and put before
their nose, a lemon, a lime, and a
[SPEAKER_00]: grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is going to be able to tell them
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have lime in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're based, but it's the trace
components that really make the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in the both aromas and the flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same would be true about the
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the psychopharmacological
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's an art and a science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend a lot of time looking at
certificates of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I also want to know how,
how are people affected by this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're generally, if you know what
you're doing, they're good correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think this really highlights that
one of the advantages of cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal is that it really brings about
the possibility of individualized
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we really can tailor the
contents of the cannabis to what the
[SPEAKER_00]: person really needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what ails them on how do we help
them with that through the right profile
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a short break and be
right back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the National Hemp Program in flux due
to stringent THC testing requirements,
[SPEAKER_04]: brothers Seth and Eric Crawford continue
to release seeds to hemp farmers that will
[SPEAKER_04]: be legal, no matter how you grow them or
when you test them.
[SPEAKER_04]: These new varieties from Oregon CBD seeds
have substantial amounts of CBDV,
[SPEAKER_04]: CBGV, CBCV and THCV while always staying
below the 0.3% THC limit and guaranteeing
[SPEAKER_04]: complying crops for farmers every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, these new varieties cannot be
pollinated by your neighbor's uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_04]: pollen or a rogue male in your own crop
either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon CBD seeds are non-GMO certified
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon CBD seeds was founded and funded in
2015 by Seth and Eric, maxing out their
[SPEAKER_04]: personal credit cards without outside
investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: They continue to refuse outside investment
that would change their company culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon CBD grows tons of fresh food on
their research farms for local food banks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally tons of food.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also give away tens of thousands of
pounds of R&D flour to patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: As their company began to succeed,
Seth and Eric started donating money to
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause
too by giving millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon State University in order to
establish the world's leading cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: genomics research program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they treat their employees right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon CBD pays for full health and dental
coverage for their employees, a 401k
[SPEAKER_04]: program and their minimum starting wage is
20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus everyone shares food from the farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seth has been on Shaping Fire a few times
to talk about novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check out episodes 25 and 37 on
CBD cultivars in the hemp market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 66 on triploid cannabis genetics
and the very first Shaping Fire Live
[SPEAKER_04]: episode 47 with Seth and soil expert,
Jeff Lowenfels talking about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are a hemp farmer and you want to
grow reliable seeds that are sure to
[SPEAKER_04]: thrive in past testing, check out
oregoncbdseeds.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_04]: buying seeds for the 2021 season.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's oregoncbdseeds.com After you've
caught up on the latest Shaping Fire
[SPEAKER_04]: episodes, do you sometimes wish there was
more cannabis education available to
[SPEAKER_04]: learn?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shaping Fire has a fabulous YouTube
channel with content not found on the
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I attend conventions to speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_04]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Zoe
[SPEAKER_04]: Sigmund's lecture, Understanding Your
Endocannabinoid System, Kevin Jodry of
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderland Nursery, talking about breeding
cannabis for the best terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_04]: Frenchy Canoli's Lost Art of the
Hashishian presentation, Nicholas Mamoud
[SPEAKER_04]: on regenerative and polyculture cannabis
growing, Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabis medicine around the world,
Eric Vlaski and Josh Rutherford on
[SPEAKER_04]: solventless extraction, and Jeff Lowenfels
on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system too.
[SPEAKER_04]: While there, be sure to check out the
three 10-part Shaping Fire session series,
[SPEAKER_04]: one with Kevin Jodry, one with Dr. Ethan
Russo, and one with Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even my own presentations on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_04]: high.

[SPEAKER_04]: polyculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_04]: loyalty in the customers you already have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_04]: it and you're not ready to hire somebody
full-time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_04]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_04]: At Blunt Branding, Kirsten Nelson and her
team are focused on improving your bottom
[SPEAKER_04]: line.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_04]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_04]: most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_04]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_04]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_04]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_04]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals and humbled at
[SPEAKER_04]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_04]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_04]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_04]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_04]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_04]: on results.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_04]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Similarly, every single friend I have
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_04]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_04]: give Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_04]: a call.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will share proven techniques to

[SPEAKER_04]: Blunt Branding, marketing that makes you
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los,
[SPEAKER_04]: and our guests this week are Dr. Ethan
Russo, Tony Verzura, Jeff Chilton,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Berner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's return to the panel discussion now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the first alternative medicines
people often turn to in their life is
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, but few folks understand the
general action that cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: the active ingredient in cannabis,
take.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that an explanation of the
endocannabinoid system could take hours
[SPEAKER_04]: because we have done that on the Shaping
Fire podcast, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But for today, can you distill it down and
give us a summary of what cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_04]: in the cannabis plant and how they
generally interact with the human body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is a very complex issue,
but we have this thing called an
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system within us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system is the master
regulator of homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homeostasis is a balance in function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have neurotransmitters, chemical
messengers between nerve cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system regulates their
release, and it actually inhibits the
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it inhibits a stimulatory
neurotransmitter, it damps down that
[SPEAKER_00]: signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it inhibits an inhibitory signal,
it's magnifying the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are more endocannabinoids,
CB1 receptor, receptor in the brain that
[SPEAKER_00]: have a greater density than that for all
of the neurotransmitters put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's any aspect of brain function
is influenced by the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the same thing applies to digestion or
any other functions of our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really gives the foundation for
why cannabis as a medicine is so versatile
[SPEAKER_00]: for so many different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a panacea, but it is amazingly
versatile in what it can do for many
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions where conventional medicine
just doesn't quite do the job properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So back to you, Tony.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Tony, everyone on this roundtable is a
proponent of whole plant and fungi
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine, meaning that the medicine should
respect the structure that nature provides
[SPEAKER_04]: in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks get confused about what is and
isn't a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, with the arrival of
extracts and some of these newer products,
[SPEAKER_04]: people are playing with the vocabulary to
include their products when they often
[SPEAKER_04]: might not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks get confused about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how should we think about the oils of a
cannabis plant as whole, even though it's
[SPEAKER_04]: no longer a part of the entire plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Another good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so the way I look at this is it's very
interesting because when we talk about a
[SPEAKER_03]: full spectrum oil, as an example,
we have to think about how did we get to
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking he was talking about CO2
earlier and CO2 itself is under a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure and it takes the buds themselves
and it passes at very high PSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: From gas to liquid and it goes through the
plant and it generally pulls a lot out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a clean process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally don't like this process
because of a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the process of the CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the post-processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if we're able to pull all of this
raw extract out and if you were to stay
[SPEAKER_03]: with raw CO2 and did nothing else,
that's a different conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're going to be pulling a lot of
these lipids and plant fats.
[SPEAKER_03]: And waxes and honestly, a lot of heavy
metals because of the way that extraction
[SPEAKER_03]: method works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so everyone tends to winterize or
de-wax their full spectrum oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the process of using ethanol is
what they do is an eight to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they just take that muck,
they pour alcohol over it, and then they
[SPEAKER_03]: turn it into a solution and they freeze
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they bind that alcohol to the
fats and then they pour everything out,
[SPEAKER_03]: which as Russo knows, destroys all the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're also talking about polar,
semi-polar, non-polar, and polar
[SPEAKER_03]: properties of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we're really talking about a
true full spectrum oil that's been
[SPEAKER_03]: unadulterated, it wouldn't be CO2 through
winterization.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't be ethanol through
distillation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't be a hydrocarbon and then
distillation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we talk about hydrocarbon and there
are good extraction methods with
[SPEAKER_03]: hydrocarbon, that's using those mono
terpenes and terpenes that we were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also a group of hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_03]: So terpenes themselves are hydrocarbons
and the hydrocarbon used in the BHO
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction actually kind of binds to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a low PSI pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to pass right through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they know what they're doing and
they have a full recovery system,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're making live resin and making all
these particular oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really a full spectrum oil if
there's none of the butane left in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we have to look at ourselves
and say, well, did that chemical or that
[SPEAKER_03]: solvent that passes through the plant
alter the full spectrum oil?
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, the answer is also yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that then takes us to the next
category of, say, particular flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we move to flower rosin, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we get to a flower rosin,
similar to CO2, much less waxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have 8 to 12 percent,
but we're actually going to get a full
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum oil out of flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we just press the flowers, put them
under pressure, we are basically using
[SPEAKER_03]: high pressure and steam to secrete all of
and expel all of those oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a true solvent list.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full spectrum oil will have some of the
lipids and waxes in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we were talking about that before
and we said, what's the cleanest and the
[SPEAKER_03]: most accurate representation is flower
rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, in the dabbing world,
if we were using that for capsules and
[SPEAKER_03]: other things, it would be very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the in the world of where we're at,
the scalability of creating that,
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to say, hey, do you have 100
pounds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you press 100 pounds of flowers this
week to keep up?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also very difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be able to take that flower rosin,
it used to be a popular thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: like four years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then dabbers, they start using quartz
and they start using puffco peaks and
[SPEAKER_03]: different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, man, they're leaving a bunch
of stuff behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the waxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we then there's only a couple
other methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we move to hash rosin or live
rosin, which then we're just separate and
[SPEAKER_03]: separating out all the resin glands to get
a full spectrum profile of the actual
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to say to ourselves,
there's, you know, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's about 50 percent of the plants
terpenes are inherently in the leaf and in
[SPEAKER_03]: the surface of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the ones we're actually desiring
that we want to smoke and has the most
[SPEAKER_03]: abundant is in the heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just like what Jeff was talking about,
these mushroom heads, I'm looking for the
[SPEAKER_03]: trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we separate, we're going to
get heads and we're going to get a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of the stalks in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we talk about a full spectrum
from a hash rosin, we're trying to isolate
[SPEAKER_03]: the best of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm going to try to pick these
grades of fruit from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we were talking about a lemon tree
and the tree was ripe, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you hit the tree the right time,
you were able to shoulder it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the lemons that come off as your
first, the best, the best lemons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you kind of pick through the tree as
it gets ripe and you pull those off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for me personally, I'm going to try
to get all of the best fruit to make my
[SPEAKER_03]: juice from it, to make that full spectrum
oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, when I do that, that's where I then
take it to the next level where people,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you said, there's misunderstandings
where they think, oh, you're reintroducing
[SPEAKER_03]: or altering it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I could get to this particular before
it gets to that oil, let's say we were
[SPEAKER_03]: able to get expel all of those heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we're looking at the surface of the
trichome head as a grape, like as a grape
[SPEAKER_03]: is, I want to remove these skins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is when we make hash rosin or
live rosin, we're pressing it and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping the skins in there, but a little
bit of those skins melt in the process and
[SPEAKER_03]: it gets into live rosin or it gets into
hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot, much less than flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to end somewhere around
3%.
[SPEAKER_03]: What all I'm doing is being able to remove
those impurities and it's naturally
[SPEAKER_03]: allowing the terpenes and naturally
allowing all these other cannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_03]: boost that themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the world of what I'm saying,
deconstructing and rebuilding,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's kind of just like an easier way to
educate people because it's already
[SPEAKER_03]: typical for you guys to, for everyone to
like follow that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I went from terpenoids to
terpenes to just terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's the terps, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's like, people were like,
all right, what's your wax?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're like no wax, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So deconstruction, people get that in
their head and it's just an artistic way
[SPEAKER_03]: of saying, Hey, I'm just breaking these
things out, but I'm really maintaining and
[SPEAKER_03]: preserving the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me personally, full spectrum is
getting to the purest portion and trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to do a 10 to one as what Jeff's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the extracts that I'm doing,
I'm even getting to a 15 to one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that explanation too, because it
again focuses on the fact of how much
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer education that we all have to do
as an industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I mean, how many of these threads
have we seen online where people are
[SPEAKER_04]: arguing about this when nobody involved in
the discussion actually understands the
[SPEAKER_04]: science, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Hey Jeff, earlier you were talking
about how the different varieties of
[SPEAKER_04]: mushrooms play well together and how the
ancient Chinese folks recognize this and
[SPEAKER_04]: they made these blends.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I go to my acupuncturist,
she is going to do some physical
[SPEAKER_04]: acupuncture on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's probably going to recommend a
mushroom blend for me for whatever I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for relief from.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then she also gives me a particular
diet and foods.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she actually told me she wanted to
learn more about terpenes too recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave her a true terpene sampler.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, here, start smelling these and
learn, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But where I'm going with this is that she
says that mushrooms are a type of medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: that plays well with other medicines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because I pay her based on time,
I couldn't get a full explanation from
[SPEAKER_04]: her.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm really curious to hear your
insight on mushrooms ability to play well
[SPEAKER_04]: with these other synergistic inputs we've
been talking about, like cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what, Shango, there's
actually not that much research out there
[SPEAKER_01]: on that subject specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I look at mushrooms is that they
are, in a sense, food as medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can start out by just putting them
in your diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mushrooms are kind of a forgotten food.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Asia, everybody eats mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like 12, 15 different species in
the marketplace that people are eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this kind of too gets back to what
Ethan was referring to earlier about
[SPEAKER_01]: products that actually will help with
homeostasis, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mushrooms are the perfect food and
medicine in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're what are considered an adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And adaptogens, that's kind of their role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Homeostasis, harmony.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you talk to anybody in China,
traditional Chinese medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: practitioners, for example, too,
that's really what they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, disease, they did look at that as
you're out of balance some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're really trying to bring you back
into balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, that's a big part of what
mushrooms do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one of the great balancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one of the great harmony herbs out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, in a sense, you can combine them
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one thing you have to understand
too is that sometimes when you put too
[SPEAKER_01]: many different, for example, in this case,
mushroom species together, you end up
[SPEAKER_01]: diluting the primary species.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are giving you the major benefits
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can only go so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know how sometimes there's a
race to like what I call the kitchen sink
[SPEAKER_01]: products out there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything in one jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never have to eat anything else or
supplement with anything else because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: got everything you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a certain level where you do have
a synergy or where putting things together
[SPEAKER_01]: makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for example, for me, there are maybe
five mushrooms that I would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, you get up to five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go any further because now you're
just going to actually lessen the benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really, and again, in terms of
synergy, it's kind of interesting because
[SPEAKER_01]: there was actually a study that was just
done in Australia where they were
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing our mushroom extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was testing them against a whole
panel of cytokines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they were, okay, what kind of
cytokine stimulation do we have there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got each single one,
how they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they put them together,
actually they got a higher level of
[SPEAKER_01]: cytokines production through the putting
the three together than each one
[SPEAKER_01]: individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely those types of
benefits from putting them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're still kind of new in that sense
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're not anywhere close to being
what Tony's doing right now, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the triterpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing too, getting back to
just full spectrum, what I'm really trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to do is I'm trying to bring everything
out of the dried mushroom, all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to leave anything behind in
my extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're not at the point where we're
trying to build up this or build up that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we can do there is basically through
the cultivar itself, because different
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars, for example, reishi cultivars,
are going to have different levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: triterpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: A researcher that I saw his presentation
back in 2002, had tested 12 different
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars of reishi.
[SPEAKER_01]: The level of triterpenes was from two to
12%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the key thing for us is making sure
that we have a cultivar that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: give us a good measure of triterpenoids,
which I think are really important and
[SPEAKER_01]: what sets Ganoderma or the reishi apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's very important
constituent of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really do the cultivar itself and
testing it to make sure our starting
[SPEAKER_01]: material when we are creating that extract
is high in what we want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Ethan, you know, because because this
panel involves cannabis, chances are that
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of the folks who end up watching it
are going to be tokers, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: people who have smoked cannabis for some
or all of their life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, as the only medical doctor
on the panel today, I would like to hear
[SPEAKER_04]: your thoughts on alternative forms of
ingesting these synergistic medicinals
[SPEAKER_04]: that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of us are used to smoking our
cannabis medicine in flower form.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, more people are getting
interested in edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, a lot of folks are selling,
you know, a cookie or a gummy or something
[SPEAKER_04]: that is more like candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe some companies use isolate and
all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas if people are really thinking
about the medicinal nature of delivery,
[SPEAKER_04]: capsules are a really good way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is, I've never explained to
people why that's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know it's true from working with
patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: So would you talk to the idea of taking,
you know, these synergistic medicines in a
[SPEAKER_04]: capsule form to kind of educate people on
why putting this stuff in their belly
[SPEAKER_04]: works for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's preface this by saying that,
you know, I really don't recommend smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: because of lung irritation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vaporization is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of getting the most bang for
the buck from terpenoids, vaporization or
[SPEAKER_00]: topical application that does get through
the skin, those are both going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: When terpenoids are taken orally,
they're not going to be quite as
[SPEAKER_00]: prominent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They certainly will have effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't lose that entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effect orally is going to be better
when there is a lipid carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, with a fat and certainly
with a gel cap that is an oil base,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get good absorption of the
terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a proper edible, with a proper
edible, there will definitely be a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people will appreciate as compared to
an isolate with just cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so while we're used to, you know,
smoking our cannabinoids and having it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, hit our bloodstream through our
lungs, you're saying that when we take it
[SPEAKER_04]: as a capsule and it finds its way to our
stomach, that our stomach is very
[SPEAKER_04]: effective in pulling all these apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while they may have a different
experience, we're still getting the
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal qualities from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a right of summation?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: When terpenoids are taken orally,
they're going to hit the liver and be
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolized somewhat faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're inhaled, they're going to
have the ability to go straight to the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain without passing the liver first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the effect is going to be more
pronounced, but with a good formulation
[SPEAKER_00]: orally, it will get absorbed and it will
modulate THC and the other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly, you know, in a gummy,
it's most likely going to be an isolate,
[SPEAKER_00]: just THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not likely going to see a lot of
full spectrum gummies that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give a quality experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't think of those as medicines
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're to our last question of the
panel, and it's going to be the same
[SPEAKER_04]: question for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to hear all of your thoughts as
we look into the future and kind of put
[SPEAKER_04]: our visionary hats on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as answering the order,
I'm going to ask it first to Berner,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then Jeff, if you would jump in and
answer the question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Ethan, we'll come to you third,
and then we'll finish off with Tony here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this last question is the same for all
of you, and it's about your motivations
[SPEAKER_04]: and hopes for the future of synergistic
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where we want to see our community go.
[SPEAKER_04]: While pharmaceuticals can do much good,
and we've all seen the substantial amount
[SPEAKER_04]: of bad that they can do too, that has led
to our movement towards alternatives we
[SPEAKER_04]: are seeing now and we've been talking
about today and we all participate in.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your vision of the future for the
creation of new medicinal blends and an
[SPEAKER_04]: increase in their accessibility to
patients directly?
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go ahead and start with Berner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like it's our job to educate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all had different platforms.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys know the science of it a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been experimenting with some stuff
that Tony created, and it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: blend on some of the stuff that we talked
about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've noticed a major change in my body
when it comes to anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had anxiety for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to take Xanax to kind of calm my
body down and wasn't really having the
[SPEAKER_02]: best sleep because of metformin,
which I take.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of my diabetes and whatnot,
and recently just mixing the CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: the CBN, and some of the mushroom blend
that Tony has put together has really
[SPEAKER_02]: changed my life for the better a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it's my job that I have a
nice platform and a voice to the black and
[SPEAKER_02]: brown community and to the urban community
to educate them on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people think mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think we're getting high or they
think gas station mushrooms, not really
[SPEAKER_02]: real mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like my role right now,
my kind of mission and the future of plant
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine is to educate, put in hands and
kind of help everyone's bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the CBN, I never really was up
on CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really understand how important
CBN is or CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just been a pothead for a long time
and I've been smoking herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by taking daily blends, I've noticed a
big change in my body and my sleep
[SPEAKER_02]: patterns and my anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of people that I speak to,
my audiences, deal with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: post-traumatic stress, anxiety,
pain, depression, sleep problems,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially the diabetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the future of plant medicine is
educating, putting in the hands and
[SPEAKER_02]: providing real access.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want people to buy gas station
mushrooms and have a bad experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want people to buy gas station
CBD for their grandma that really needs
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to provide safe, real,
credible access to the medicine that's
[SPEAKER_02]: helped change my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just look forward to being able
to kind of roll this out properly and kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of just educate my people, the younger
people, the people that don't really think
[SPEAKER_02]: that this is a medicine or any of these
things, mushroom or cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked about that earlier,
but that's kind of my agenda and my
[SPEAKER_02]: objective moving forward is just putting
in the hands of people and letting them
[SPEAKER_02]: understand it's really good for your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the stuff that we're
prescribed like Metformin or Xanax is not
[SPEAKER_02]: the best for us long-term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our bodies don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's ways that we can educate,
put in the hands and just kind of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: his education will be a lot different than
mine, which would be a lot different than
[SPEAKER_02]: yours, which would be a lot different than
his, but combined is very powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we all need to play our role for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jeff, let's get you on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where would you like to see these
synergistic medicinals come together going
[SPEAKER_04]: forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me first say it looks like we've
got a new term that's come out of this gas
[SPEAKER_01]: station mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's really interesting having
been in like the supplement industry for
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I started growing mushrooms in
1973 commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been doing that for a long time,
but in terms of the supplement industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been there since 1989 when mushrooms
were still not even in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know company had a mushroom product and
I had to really do a lot of education,
[SPEAKER_01]: but back then the industry was full of
actual herbalists and people who were,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some of them actually coming out
of being cannabis growers, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people who were really deep into
it in a totally different way,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that's happened is
our industry has gone from what I would
[SPEAKER_01]: call products that are a little more
natural, a little more earthy to a
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that has come just from the
regulations that have been put in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are saddled with regulations that make
us adhere to a pharmaceutical model.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way everything is produced in terms,
not necessarily the way we grow our
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms, that's still quite natural,
but in terms of processing and in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: the different standards that we have to
meet before we can sell the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I'm really kind
of concerned about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are a lot of people in the
industry, because I totally believe in
[SPEAKER_01]: organic production and certified organic
products and keeping with that whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be regenerative agriculture or
basically staying closer to the earth and
[SPEAKER_01]: not so much into the pharmacy,
so to speak, those kind of sterilized,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's like getting a certificate
of analysis and you look at the heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals in there, a pharmaceutical model
would be, or the microbe, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbiological panel, zeros.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I see zeros, I think,
okay, now somebody along the line has
[SPEAKER_01]: irradiated this or done something to it to
kill off all the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not a place where we really
want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, going forward, what I think is
really important is just maintaining that
[SPEAKER_01]: natural component of this and not getting
too far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what it's really about, it's just
like me being in Mexico back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: seventies and, you know, smoking the
different weed from different states and
[SPEAKER_01]: living in Oaxaca and the plants that were
being grown there, which were just
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are kind of a pot that I really
love and makes me feel really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, for me, I think moving into the
future, there's a lot of things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can do, a lot of synergies that we will
find, especially like right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love the fact that Cookies is
putting mushrooms in with their cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that's, you know,
we'll see where that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, the key for me is keeping it
natural, keeping it close to the earth and
[SPEAKER_01]: not getting too far into that whole
pharmaceutical model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Ethan, I know that you think about
these synergistic products a lot with
[SPEAKER_04]: Credo Science that you founded.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your vision of the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in addition to internal projects,
we're really moving now into formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our whole ethos is to make cannabis safer
and better, but also to extend it out into
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations with these other plant-based
medicines and fungal-based medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I very much am in tune with what Jeff
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want this to be done in a holistic,
clean manner, organic, preferably through
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're absolutely in support of those
endeavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So bring us home, Tony.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you are a big thinker and kind of
an alchemist philosopher.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I didn't put too much on you right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, what do you see as a formulator
for the direction that we should be going?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of subscribe to what the panel
is saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think what Bernard said is well
said, as well as Jeff and Ethan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I subscribe to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mission since 96 when I got into this,
I started at 16 and 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my own personal experiences with
different types of things that were
[SPEAKER_03]: prescribed to me that once I found
cannabis in the herb, I got upset and I
[SPEAKER_03]: realized that we don't, you know,
not every condition in the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the things that you touched on in the
general basis, you know, people need their
[SPEAKER_03]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have digestion.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's amazing breakthroughs with other
types of conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those are the four main major things
that's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mission since 1996 was to get people
off of synthetic opiate-based products and
[SPEAKER_03]: synthetic drugs that we can bring
plant-based medicine into a pharmacopoeia
[SPEAKER_03]: level of grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always think of plant-based,
but how do we do this at a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_03]: level to where people will take this
serious enough and understand and like
[SPEAKER_03]: just hearing what he said about the
capsule is why I do what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it affects me as a person and
it's like why I do what I do because I
[SPEAKER_03]: just want to be able to positively
influence as many people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this panel in this type of synergy
is going to do tremendous education,
[SPEAKER_03]: but ultimately that's the next move for
the next generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we start getting caught up in
synthetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We start getting caught up in artificially
trying to create experiences and things in
[SPEAKER_03]: life.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to lose ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's, for me, the mission is
plant-based.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how Tony finished with suggesting
that this synergy that we have created
[SPEAKER_04]: here, all experts from different fields,
and I think that's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in wrapping up, so let's first,
