[SPEAKER_01]: You know very often Ethan with new
cannabis patients they have got a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of trepidation and they don't know
what their experience is going to be and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know we all live so many busy so much
our lives are so busy I often tell
[SPEAKER_01]: patients to keep a journal and through
that they'll be able to look back and say
[SPEAKER_01]: oh you know these these strains or these
terpenes or these dosages ended up working
[SPEAKER_01]: out for whatever you know they're trying
to get relief from you know as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher and somebody with a long
history of clinical experience what would
[SPEAKER_01]: you recommend to a new cannabis patient
that is looking to explore the different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis modalities and how they relate to
their relate to their symptoms what notes
[SPEAKER_00]: would you suggest that they take over time
sure well it's probably a good idea
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly since a certain amount of
experimentation is often necessary to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the right preparation the right dose to
treat a given condition so first of all we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to know the preparation and as much
detail about as cannabinoid and terpenoid
[SPEAKER_00]: profile as the patient might be able to
procure and this is a tough thing because
[SPEAKER_00]: often this information isn't available but
they should also take note of how they
[SPEAKER_00]: used it whether it was inhaled or ingested
how much they used and what was the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: both on reducing their symptoms as well as
possible side effects and these kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: notes later may help them develop the kind
of correlations that are going to help
[SPEAKER_00]: them hone in on what's best for them now
there is a weakness to this argument and
[SPEAKER_00]: that is unfortunately there may not be
consistency in the marketplace so they
[SPEAKER_00]: might find something that's helpful and go
back the next month ask for the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't look the same it doesn't smell
the same it doesn't feel the same so this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a problem with some of the names that
are attached to these materials then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: there isn't always truth in advertising I
would think that it would also be helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: if a new patient is working with like some
kind of guide somebody who's giving them
[SPEAKER_01]: advice to be able to go back and see what
their experiments have been just say oh
[SPEAKER_01]: you've tried this and this maybe you
should try this different approach and do
[SPEAKER_01]: you think that it might also be helpful
you know a lot of a lot of patients have
[SPEAKER_01]: got resistance to talking to their general
physician about their cannabis experiments
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't know what the thoughts
of their general physician may be I mean I
[SPEAKER_01]: know patients who have told their their
oncologists that they are using cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and the oncologist ended the relationship
with them you know extreme example to what
[SPEAKER_01]: degree do you think that it might be
advised to to share the notes with their
[SPEAKER_01]: physician to kind of increase the the
likelihood that their physician will will
[SPEAKER_01]: will I don't know bless or or or at least
give it the benefit of the doubt because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing it in a somewhat of an
academic way well to be honest it's
[SPEAKER_00]: unlikely their physician is either going
to be open to this or have significant
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge for better or worse the
situation we're finding ourselves in now
[SPEAKER_00]: is that this is a bottom-up education
experience what I mean is that it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: often the patients educating the doctors
about what's been helpful to them in
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to cannabis medicine then vice
versa if their doctors open to this I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that they could have a great role in
educating him or her and hopefully they
[SPEAKER_00]: have that kind of relationship but it's
not always the case right on cool thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you you you
