[SPEAKER_00]: So Joshua, thank you for taking a second
to talk with me here at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have been really aware of your
soil cultivation science conference that
[SPEAKER_00]: is starting to tour the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I think it's really cool
that people can finally get high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: soil science education, you know,
that is on tour, right, and is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to take a second so you could
tell us a little bit about the conference
[SPEAKER_00]: so that people can check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man, well, thanks for letting me
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the reason is in the name,
the Science of Organic Regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Cultivation Conference,
and it's definitely long-winded,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a tongue twister.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, you know, it's the idea is to
break through the murky waters of organic
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I was learning to do this,
it was very hard to find people that could
[SPEAKER_01]: teach me the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's got their methods and it may
work on their farm, but when you translate
[SPEAKER_01]: it to another farm, it's a different
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a different bio-nome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of what we're trying to do
is bring some of these heads in who
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't been able to talk about cannabis
because of legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, bring them on tour and
really bring people through the process in
[SPEAKER_01]: each step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, here's soil structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Dr. Arlene Ingham, who is a famous
soil food web lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: She comes to like open the conference up
and teach us about the players.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we walk with Chip Osborne into
soil chemistry, soil diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have Layton kind of talking the
same thing, soil Layton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's my partner that actually puts this on
with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And day two, we switch into bio-stimulants
with Chris Trump, who I think you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: he does KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Chris Trump's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: KNF is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually took his course this summer and
I am fermenting everything all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's a way to create
bio-stimulants or nutrients on your
[SPEAKER_01]: property with the stuff that's,
you know, around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have Dr. Faust, which
everybody knows bio-ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humic acid, fulvic acid, like definitely a
component that's hard for us to acquire on
[SPEAKER_01]: our properties, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Jodry is even flying out,
isn't he?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's day three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I am so stoked that Kevin's
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he brings the full package together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day three, we get to talk about genetics
and he's bringing in breeders from each
[SPEAKER_01]: region.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, you know, we're going to
Vancouver, to Ann Arbor, Michigan,
[SPEAKER_01]: to Redway, Southern Humboldt and into
Portland, Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's bringing in breeders from that
region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have a seed swap and a genetic
swap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to be so blessed to be
around these heads and learn from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people want to find out more about
it, will you give them the website slowly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've messed it up a couple of
times myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the website where people can
find out more?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to make it easier,
regenerativeorganiccannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the four cities again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt, Redway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Vancouver, Canada.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is it Portland, Maine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland, Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ann Arbor, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're anywhere drivable from those
areas, make sure you check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of name brand soil science folks and
you'll get to meet Joshua too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one more thing I'd like to say is that
one thing we do different here is we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your ticket sales pay directly for the
speakers to come and travel and be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're there to talk with you,
to communicate with you and hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an in and out deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there to hang and so you can
actually get off class time with these
[SPEAKER_00]: folks instead of them rushing off to their
next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're paying them to stay long and
extra for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's really important to be
authentic in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not judging anybody for doing vendors
or sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do it your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I wish you and Leighton the best
with the program and we'll talk on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side and see how it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
