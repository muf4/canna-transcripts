[SPEAKER_01]: So Ethan, you know, you often say that
it's important for patients to not confuse
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactivity with efficacy, meaning some
patients think that they need to get high
[SPEAKER_01]: for the cannabis medicine to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hear this all the time from people,
especially people who are new to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I don't want to do cannabis
medicine because I don't want to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you tell people to explain to them
the difference between the
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactiveness of some cannabinoids
versus the efficacy of them reducing the
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms that they're looking to help
with?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they don't necessarily have to go
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not going to say that euphoria is a
bad thing and a touch of euphoria can be
[SPEAKER_00]: great to a patient who's had a chronic
disorder and finally has experienced some
[SPEAKER_00]: relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody's going to feel great or euphoric
under those circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to the Food and Drug Administration,
euphoria is listed as a side effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, many consumers, particularly
cannabis naive people who might benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from its uses of medicine, aren't looking
to have any level of psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rather are seeking symptom relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is the case and has been
established that most often there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet spot in using a properly constituted
cannabis-based medicine wherein the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient has symptom control without
adverse events, meaning without side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, particularly of a psychoactive
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those would be anxiety, paranoia,
things you don't want, as well as things
[SPEAKER_00]: like euphoria, which are not necessarily
bad, but not necessary to get symptom
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been amply demonstrated in
randomized controlled trials of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-based medicines that you can
achieve pain control or control of
[SPEAKER_00]: spasticity, muscle tightness and multiple
sclerosis, bladder symptoms, any number of
[SPEAKER_00]: things without a concomitant level of
intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, without being high or
having other associated problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most people, this is going to be
the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with psychoactivity associated
with cannabis is more often associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with smoking or with vaporization because
this creates a peak of activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: both serum levels and brain levels,
a quick peak, but also a quicker offset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to produce more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means more frequent dosing,
the greater chance of psychoactive side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, greater chance of re-infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reinforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reinforcement is the idea that drugs that
are very short-acting are more likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: get people hooked, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I can tell you that in medical usage,
the risk of dependency on cannabis is next
[SPEAKER_00]: to nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it means a big concern for
regulatory bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been shown that, for instance,
the cannabis-based medicine Sativex has a
[SPEAKER_00]: very low drug abuse liability.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, risk of dependency or
other associated problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're setting aside that we want to
have the THC in the medicine so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can take advantage of the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to have some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to use the other minor
cannabinoids and terpenes to essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: push these other buttons, if you will,
in the human so that they can get the
[SPEAKER_01]: relief, say, for example, the
anti-inflammatory relief or working with
[SPEAKER_01]: their migraines or the irritable bowel
syndrome, without folks necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling the psychoactivity of being high.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can an individual patient figure out
how much THC to have in the mix so that
[SPEAKER_01]: they have enough for the entourage effect,
but not enough that they experience the
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactivity or euphoria that they may
not necessarily want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everyone's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what a patient needs depends on their
prior experience, whether they've used
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis before, whether they might have
some degree of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something we can't easily measure,
what we call their endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means how much endogenous cannabinoid
do they have naturally in their system?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the state of the receptors,
their density and their activity level?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that these are important,
but we don't know how to measure those
[SPEAKER_00]: easily yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still research techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can issue some general guidelines on
dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two and a half milligrams of THC is a
threshold dose for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will feel it, some will not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five is a moderate dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost everyone is going to feel,
unless they've developed tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 10 milligrams is going to be too much
for someone whose cannabis is naive and
[SPEAKER_00]: should be about as much as anyone would
need in a single dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it makes a big difference,
the route of delivery, but that would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: general guideline.
[SPEAKER_00]: In chronic usage, I like people to limit
their total daily usage of THC to
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in the 15 to 20 milligram range,
exceptionally 30 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, we're talking about a greater
likelihood of side effects and not a
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood of increased efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with those levels of THC, we might
have a great deal more CBD necessary to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those would be general guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said that dosage is based,
a significance consideration is tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I absolutely know that there's folks
who are watching who are taking 100
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams THC edibles, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, say for example, they're chronic
pain patients or something, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the only thing that gets them
through their day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you kind of jive those two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we want to keep people below 30
milligrams a day, but with tolerance,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got patients that are taking 100
milligrams at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, but it's just because of that
tolerance that they can handle 100
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't mean that that number is
necessary to really gain symptom control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe if they were to titrate down,
they would be able to get the same relief
[SPEAKER_01]: for less money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there is a technique that's been
pioneered by Dustin Sulak, my colleague in
[SPEAKER_00]: Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls it resensitization procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will have the patient is using what
seems to be too much THC on a daily basis,
[SPEAKER_00]: stop for 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a month, two days of nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then resume at half the prior dose of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he's seen is the level of symptom
control at half the dose is just as good
[SPEAKER_00]: as it was at the prior full dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially it's a short, intense
tolerance break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, you'd be able to hopefully
get the same benefits that you had been
[SPEAKER_01]: getting out of a lot less milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with less capital expenditure as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preserve your patient garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to hear more about dosing
suggestions, Dr. Russo co-authored a paper
[SPEAKER_01]: that came out this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the link to it is in the first
comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
