[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you want to share Armando's
presentation with others who were not able
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it here today, a video of his
presentation will appear on my YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Armando Suarez Romero has worked with
plants since he was a teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: He later graduated with a degree in farm
management and agricultural engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, he focused on research at the
University of Arizona with variety trials
[SPEAKER_00]: in greenhouse for tomatoes and bell
peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Armando spent many years consulting with
large greenhouses throughout the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_00]: specializing in consulting on crop
optimization and high-tech irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Armando is committed to using optimal
irrigation strategies to realize optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, with Grodan, Armando focuses on
crop substrate and irrigation systems in
[SPEAKER_00]: the controlled environment, agriculture of
greenhouses, and growing chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, Armando will be taking us on a
quick tour of advanced principles of
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation used by the largest growers out
there to get the most crop per drop of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please welcome Armando.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was quite an introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember ever writing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, we're basically going to go over
several techniques that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: developed over the decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Armando, if you don't go on the stage,
I won't be able to put it to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you not want to use the stage at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you still see me though?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of these techniques are not
something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're something new in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just starting really to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they derivate from 45 years of
experience in the vegetable market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the agenda for today, it's really
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really going through definitions and
concepts because we may talk about a few
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are not completely obvious for
the general population, particularly the
[SPEAKER_01]: second point, which is plant steering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, what the fuck is plant
steering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you driving a plant or what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, you can drive the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's techniques to make them do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they're plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not race cars, and that's why it's
called steering because it's a slow
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to finish, we're going to go over a
few concepts of irrigation scheduling and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually how to achieve that steering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as the general idea of the
presentation is that irrigation is really
[SPEAKER_01]: your cheapest, best bang for the buck when
you're talking of steering a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can steer the plant by labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much any physical damage or pruning
that you do on a plant will have a
[SPEAKER_01]: steering answer, except that it requires a
huge amount of labor to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with environmental.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can modify the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can modify the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can modify the lighting inside the
draw room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those take energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And energy and labor are your biggest
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to minimize those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best bang for the buck is really
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is generally just an adjustment on
your time clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always get the hard question of how
much should I water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, people, do not write this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the abomination called
Penman-Martin equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took the USDA about 40 years to get
this one down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just to illustrate how complicated
that question of how much water should I
[SPEAKER_01]: put.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole moral of this story is really
that you really want to control the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really want to control the lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really want to control the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the three main factors that
influence how much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will depend on how hot,
how bright, how humid the room is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funnily enough, it never depends on where
the roots are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots of the plant do not influence
how much water you put in overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the parameters of controlling the root
zone are really just the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: the air content, the PC, the pH,
and the chemical availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any barrier to that water absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big ones are really what's happening
in the canopy environment from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Penman-Martin equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk very shortly on pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just because, and this is
actually not related to the discussion
[SPEAKER_01]: today, but people keep asking the question
about pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a well-drained system,
[SPEAKER_01]: in hydroponic system, pH does not matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you put fresh solution every
time, and you manage to have the system
[SPEAKER_01]: renewed all the time, the pH that you put
at the dripper is really the only thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH that you get at the bottom does not
really influence the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you recirculate, yes, pH is
important because you're putting back that
[SPEAKER_01]: solution and then you need to control pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a drain-to-waist system,
pH does not matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you really see on pH when you
measure pH at the outlet, it's really what
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is taking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on what the nutrient the
plant is uptaking, you will have a
[SPEAKER_01]: modification on pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what people are reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does not mean anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in veg, generally, you will get more
absorptions of nitrates, phosphates,
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will actually raise the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: In flour, you will get more absorption of
calcium, potassium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you will have the pH going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that means that the plant is actually
actively feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those pH swings only mean one
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feed me more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that you need to concentrate
more on EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of salts that you're putting
are actually more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's talk about water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water in a substrate and how it moves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you need to understand of water,
or what you need to understand of
[SPEAKER_01]: substrates, is that they're generally a
mix of different size holes within a solid
[SPEAKER_01]: matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the water will have a tendency to go
into the largest holes first and follow
[SPEAKER_01]: the path of the substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least resistance, followed by gravity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main force when you put water
inside a container or a pot of pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: any media out there, it will literally go
through the biggest holes first and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: find its way to the bottom of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, when you put water into something,
that something is not empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's full of air, generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water and air are actually fighting for
the same space.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a pot, generally, that means that
you're going to see bubbles at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the water is trying to go down,
the air is trying to go up and escape it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main force at that point is always
gravity.
[SPEAKER_01]: When water encounters an error at the
bottom of the pot, it tends to accumulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the interface effect,
where water literally pulls at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will notice that before it drains,
water will actually literally accumulate
[SPEAKER_01]: in the form of a cone shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you see in many pots,
all the roots generally at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the roots are following the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's imagine you stop the irrigation
right when that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water has not yet run off out of the
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it going to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now you get a different force acting
on that wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That force is the capillary forces in
whatever substrate you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the water is going to move laterally
and occupy the smallest pores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the ones that the water bypassed
by gravity before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the water is going to go into those
spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to actually manage to wet all the
sides, all the shores, all the shoulders
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pot, you need to actually
strategically stop the watering at certain
[SPEAKER_01]: moments.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't do that, water just runs off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And molecules of water have the weird
ability that they want to actually stay
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once the water beats that interface
layer, it will actually pull the water
[SPEAKER_01]: from the container out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by pulling the water out, you will
actually get the media dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the irrigation scheduling is about
planning that effect between that forced
[SPEAKER_01]: drainage, which by the way, not only takes
water with it, but also takes force with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And strategic stopping of irrigation to
actually be able to wet all the sides and
[SPEAKER_01]: wet the entire volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we get into the watering paradox,
where by putting more water into the pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you actually make the media, the
substrate, drier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it sounds completely
counterintuitive, but yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you start draining and the pot is
not yet completely wet, you will have to
[SPEAKER_01]: put an incredible amount of water,
like 10 times the amount of water to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to wet that pot completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, here we're talking about media
that are very, very free-grained.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're talking of peat moss or some
grains of cocoa, you will achieve this
[SPEAKER_01]: wetting effect a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they all have their own set of
problems that if you put too much water,
[SPEAKER_01]: now they're waterlogged.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, every substrate has a
slightly different reaction to this
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these generally, these are pretty much
across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you only have to remember one slide
of the entire pot, this is probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: key one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by having short watering events,
you prevent the drainage that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to accumulate water in the
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because you have no escape for the
salts, you're also going to raise the PC
[SPEAKER_01]: in the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you have the exact same schedule,
but now you put longer watering,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to achieve the rafts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to achieve a drier pot,
but you're also going to flush the salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're also lowering the EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're lowering the water content and
lowering the EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, notice there's several ways to
schedule the irrigation, and not only how
[SPEAKER_01]: long every irrigation event is,
but also how frequently you put the
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually really on the frequency
that you vary the overall amount of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually much better to put shorter
irrigation events very often than one long
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation event very seldomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you put more watering events,
you're going to put more water overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to lower the EC and raise
the water content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing, if you shorten, if you cut
irrigation events, you put less water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your water content just goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rewetting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet all of you, even when you were five
years old, realized that it was easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: wet a wet sponge than a dry sponge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing when you were watering pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to actually irrigate a pot
that is not yet completely bone dry than a
[SPEAKER_01]: pot that is completely bone dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the re-wetting ability of the substrate
is also very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never really want to go under a
certain level of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it's very difficult to re-wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ideally, when you irrigate,
that's something that you need to take
[SPEAKER_01]: into account, is to keep this thing as
steady as possible to be able to re-wet
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it gets too dry, it's almost
impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the illustration on why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, you have very long irrigations
that were put on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well guess what, all the roots are on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you go with very short
irrigations very often, and you may notice
[SPEAKER_01]: that these two may actually have the same
amount of water overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it also has the effectivity of your
irrigation scheduling, influence also how
[SPEAKER_01]: much water you're going to put and how
much fertilizers you're going to consume
[SPEAKER_01]: and drain down into the waste stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, this is what it's supposed to
look like with roots all over the place,
[SPEAKER_01]: even at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, plant steering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetarian growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dispel a misnomer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: For many, many years, the cannabis
industry has been using the word
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative to refer to the vegetative
stage, to refer to the photo period where
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is never induced to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this presentation, and for most
steering discussions, we're going to use
[SPEAKER_01]: the word vegetative as really the
production of leaf and stem, which
[SPEAKER_01]: granted, that's mostly what you do in the
veg phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what, even after you flip the
plant, your first two or three weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're mostly still building canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still mostly creating stems and
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would almost argue, you know what,
the vegetative phase really ends at your
[SPEAKER_01]: second or third week of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have several plants that,
if you keep them too comfy, if you keep
[SPEAKER_01]: them too comfortable, you may have
remarked that, as growers, they're still
[SPEAKER_01]: very leafy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still very dark green.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves are fat, the stems are fat,
and they produce little, teeny,
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is actually a plant that,
even that it has been induced to flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still very vegetative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still hormonally induced to produce
and put all of its energy into the
[SPEAKER_01]: production of stems and leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember, here you're trying to
produce flowers, so I would say squeeze
[SPEAKER_01]: them bitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to stress them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants generally react to stress,
environmental stress, like drought,
[SPEAKER_01]: like cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of the cannabis plant,
it's basically a photoperiodic reaction
[SPEAKER_01]: that indicates to the plant that winter is
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally, you're right about,
in nature, right about around the equinox,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fall equinox, where the day and the
night are pretty much the same length.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when normally the cannabis plant is
induced to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those hormonal reactions are
actually created by environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the plant is induced to move the
sugar that it produces into the
[SPEAKER_01]: reproductive system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essentially, hey, I'm dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to reproduce as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get done with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no longer putting the sugar in the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is called generative growth,
also called reproductive growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's essentially the opposite of the
vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you will notice that normally plants,
in that type of stress, are induced to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce smaller leaves, thinner stems,
of course, because they're pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: putting all the nutrients into the flower,
not into the stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get, also, in cases where it's
very generative, you may get root die-offs
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can clearly observe when the
plant is literally arriving to the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: its life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you can say, how do I steal that
through irrigation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice that you can steal that,
like I mentioned previously, with pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or with environmental controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, irrigation is the cheapest way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So vegetative is, of course, when you have
a very, very high water content in the
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is not very stressed,
drought stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will produce leaves and stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start stressing the plant and
simulating drought, the plant will react
[SPEAKER_01]: with generative growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing when you decrease the
irrigation period at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a plant that has been
trained from the beginning to accept in
[SPEAKER_01]: the water from this time of the day to
this time of the day, and you start
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing the time of the day that when
they receive water, they will get the cue
[SPEAKER_01]: that, eh, need to put that energy into the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irrigation frequencies, every irrigation
is a cue, a vegetative cue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you reduce the number of irrigations,
you will give a generative cue.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you raise the EC, you can cause a
salt stress instead of a water stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by raising the EC, by lowering the EC,
you get a vegetative response.
[SPEAKER_01]: By raising the EC, you get a generative
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature of the substrate also matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get very, very often those crops
literally exploding with growth at the
[SPEAKER_01]: change of season when the water
temperature out of the faucet come at a
[SPEAKER_01]: different temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same happened generally at the end of
the winter when suddenly the water coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the faucet is really, really cold,
and you get crops that become very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very weak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have growers panicking,
like, well, why the crop is doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it coming to a standstill?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's because the water is too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some fertilizers also influence,
and that's certainly, it's very funny
[SPEAKER_01]: because most of these things you have been
doing all along, and you have been timing
[SPEAKER_01]: them mostly on the flip, the light flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can actually influence and give
those cues even after you flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your crop is becoming too weak after
the flip, you can ease up on it to give it
[SPEAKER_01]: more vigor, to bring it more into
vegetative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing, it becomes too leafy,
too vegetative even after flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually stress it a little bit to
bring it back and start filling up the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't measure, it's kind of
difficult to manage this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to have little baselines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a graph that you can generally
get with a water content meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the water content, the temperature
of the substrate, and the EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see that, here's not the best graph
ever, but every one of these little spikes
[SPEAKER_01]: is an irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really the middle of the day,
and this would be the night where they
[SPEAKER_01]: stop the irrigation and let it drift back
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next day, they irrigate again to
bring the water content up, prepare the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants for the day, and actually lowering
the EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here the EC actually spiked.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EC generally moves in the opposite
direction than water, but not always like
[SPEAKER_01]: we saw previously depending on the
frequency that you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually manipulate this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're against the standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very nice to know what's happening in
the substrate, but you wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised if many growers don't actually
know what they're putting in and when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something as basic as putting a couple of
pots or a couple of blocks on top of a
[SPEAKER_01]: tray and collecting the runoff,
measuring the volume of the runoff,
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring the volume of how much water
you're putting, measuring the pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring the EC, or both the inlet and
outlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are basic measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think every grower should actually
have at least an idea of how much water
[SPEAKER_01]: they're putting in and how much water
they're putting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these are the same graphs that we just
saw, but the ideal one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ideal one where we have water content,
we have EC, and you have several periods
[SPEAKER_01]: during the day where you're trying to
achieve different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: By varying how long the EC is,
how long these periods are, or how
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressively you go up to what maximum
water content you get, and how dry you get
[SPEAKER_01]: the next morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually steal a plant either
vegetatively or generatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first period is really the period
where you try to get the water content up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not draining.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're putting very, very short
irrigations to increase the water content,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're also increasing the EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not allowing any drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: At one point during the day, you're
allowing the drainage, the runoff that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were talking about, to control EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the control point is really the EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're also achieving your maximum water
content for that day when you induce
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then most of the irrigation that
you're going to put after that are really
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to achieve much except
maintaining steady state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you stop the irrigation and you let
it drift in the afternoon and then during
[SPEAKER_01]: the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that if you have very
constant, particularly you can achieve
[SPEAKER_01]: that in grow rooms, where you have very
constant temperature and humidity control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have very predictable dry-downs where
you're going to actually know exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: almost where you're going to be the next
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the same strategy going
over several days where you can either go
[SPEAKER_01]: up little by little or every day and if
you increase the water content day after
[SPEAKER_01]: day, you actually get a vegetative
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start going down, you achieve the
opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a generative response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now overall, if you look at the
overall strategy or the life of the crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is starting from the flip on the
water, on the flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go down in the first week to make
them root, then start growing up back up
[SPEAKER_01]: to make them produce leaves and start to
stress them a little bit and then keep
[SPEAKER_01]: very steady when they're flowering to fill
up the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to stress them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to overly stress them at
that stage as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just an overall strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the only strategy possible,
but it's an example of what you can do and
[SPEAKER_01]: how you should actually think of
strategies for experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a little plug for our
sponsors, Grownen and The Growsense,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the little toy that allows you to
measure the water content and the EC in
[SPEAKER_01]: the block.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're on move 300 if you have any more
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the irrigation summary is really you
need to know your drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know your water content.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know your EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you cannot manage what you cannot
measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your main tools for irrigation are
frequency and length of irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are your main tools to manipulate
the root environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The substrate that you use is a tool for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to choose the substrate that
allows you to do these type of strategies
[SPEAKER_01]: in the easiest way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, measure, measure, measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because data is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I didn't blow out your brains
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have time for questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got about 8, 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I tell you about pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody was going to ask another
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just wondering about the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see anything on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, actually I had an earlier slide,
a very early slide to put to rest the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this type of technique, the pH matters
little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're on a drain to waste
system, and you renew with fresh nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: solution every time, because you're
achieving drainage at very strategic
[SPEAKER_01]: times, you're actually flushing the old
salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're always resetting the system
with the ideal pH at the dripper,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's debatable what's the effect of the
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're in a system where you're
recirculating, yes, the pH becomes very
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, most pH are going to depend on the
substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because not only the plants influence the
pH, but the substrate influences it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to use a substrate that basically
has no influence on pH at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: and leaves the pH influence only to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage of only using the plants and
having the plant as being the only actor
[SPEAKER_01]: in pH is that it generally indicates you
what nutrients are taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you renew the nutrients,
generally the pH autocorrects itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people using reservoirs that they're
recirculating, there's another trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically go with the largest
reservoir possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the larger the reservoir compared
to the amount of plants, the more stable
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, another challenge with pH is that
the water quality that you're putting in
[SPEAKER_01]: the system is going to play havoc with the
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that's a different question than
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This assumes that you already control the
pH at the dripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that it's not important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not important in the drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's not important in the drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's important before what you
do at the dripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have it at the dripper,
and you put it at the dripper at 5.5,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you get it in the drainage at 8,
well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably that your plants are feeding
nitrogen, and they're removing all the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen from the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it simply says that, hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to water either more often,
or put more nutrients in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got time for one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
