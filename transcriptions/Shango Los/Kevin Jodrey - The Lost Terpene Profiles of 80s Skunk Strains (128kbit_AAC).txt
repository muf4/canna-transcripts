[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's shango from the shaping fire
podcast I want to thank Kevin Jodry
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderland nursery and the ganje for
sharing this video with us This is part
[SPEAKER_00]: one of two part two is gonna come out
later on this week We're gonna add the
[SPEAKER_00]: link at that time right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're probably seeing it now In this
video Kevin considers late 80s really loud
[SPEAKER_00]: and skunky Turpene profiles that we found
in weed then that have gone away Because
[SPEAKER_00]: during the times people were getting
busted and they needed to have their you
[SPEAKER_00]: know We'd smell more, you know fruity and
floral then danky and skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he wants to come back to that So in
this video, he discusses the turpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles that are generally associated
with really loud strains from that time
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're if you're interested
in hearing more from Kevin I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: that you check out the other shaping fire
podcast interview I did with him In 2017
[SPEAKER_00]: all about the early origins of the CBD
strains that started in California You can
[SPEAKER_00]: find that out at the link here or you can
just go to the shaping fire comm website
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're there if you are into
terpenes Make sure that you listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: interview I did with Ben from true
terpenes as well all about terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: how they're used in your everyday life and
you know if you are into terpenes and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to buy some For yourself or to use in
production for a product that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: making Make sure you go to this link to go
to true terpenes and pick up some terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're the ones who sponsor our
channel So thanks to Kevin and Wonderland
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Gange and true terpenes for all
the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, here we go This is Kevin
Wonderland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was spending some time trying to take a
look better at the older strains from late
[SPEAKER_01]: 80s early 90s, which is to me is a sweet
spot of cannabis that it was this
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible amount of varietals that pooled
to make those those varietals and They
[SPEAKER_01]: were the only ones taken out of play not
due to obsolescence, but more to The fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that they were too highly recognizable and
something that I call BC and that's before
[SPEAKER_01]: charcoal So before charcoal filtration was
really prevalent and allowed individuals
[SPEAKER_01]: to hide cannabis in discrete situations
Some of these varietals from that time
[SPEAKER_01]: period primarily what we call skunks were
so Well known to the scent that it was an
[SPEAKER_01]: instant indicator that there was cannabis
being produced at this location and so it
[SPEAKER_01]: completely took these strains out and I've
been going back in time to dig through to
[SPEAKER_01]: repull this population out because the the
varietals were built at that time for a
[SPEAKER_01]: total enjoyment from the users perspective
and Some of these scents have been have
[SPEAKER_01]: been lost and it's trying to mine them and
find out where they exist and so I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: working with this strain called the hog
out of San Diego for a little while and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a beautiful skunk Afghani combination
and The the the genetics that make it up
[SPEAKER_01]: go back to that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might have been made, you know 20 25
years ago so a little little later than
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm speaking, but the The precursors
the plants have made it up combined and
[SPEAKER_01]: did this and so we did an interest in test
this year where we ran a humic acid mix
[SPEAKER_01]: from a company as a Test to see what it
would do on production and when I ran all
[SPEAKER_01]: the turp analysis I had the pure analytics
my lab who I've used from the inception
[SPEAKER_01]: run my turf profiles And so what I find
which was so interesting was that they had
[SPEAKER_01]: some very extreme variances in in one
specific area, but The overall smell was
[SPEAKER_01]: identical to the user.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't differentiate between the two
flowers even though one of them was 1%
[SPEAKER_01]: canteen and the other one was 1% total
pining alpha and beta pines combined and
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is pines pine and the other
camphor is more of an herbal And so it was
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing to me as I started to look at
these and try to understand From a turf
[SPEAKER_01]: profile analysis what the smell really was
and what was really taking place And so I
[SPEAKER_01]: started to wonder where does the smell
garlic come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: In in garlic and why does this flower of
the hog have such a heavy garlic odor?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went through the basic turf profiles
And we had you know alpha pining alpha
[SPEAKER_01]: pining which are pines we had and then in
the end then and then the flip sample was
[SPEAKER_01]: it had no pining had canthine but
basically the same level about 1% and So
[SPEAKER_01]: that was really the only major difference
in the two and then myrcine was dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: We had limonene's which is and myrcine's
are earths and musks and limonene's are
[SPEAKER_01]: citruses and we had linalool which is a
spicy Floral fenchol, which is a camphor
[SPEAKER_01]: caraphalene, which is a hoppy peppery
humulene, which is earthy woody Then we
[SPEAKER_01]: went into some of these lighter ones,
which was a valencine, which is an orange
[SPEAKER_01]: and then a farnesine, which is woody trans
neralidol citrus apple rose neralidol
[SPEAKER_01]: barky woody and then a Gualal I can't
really pronounce the word guaiol and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's piney and so I took a look and
these were the major terms that made up
[SPEAKER_01]: what we talked about and I started to do
some research and I started trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: out where is this smell or that we call
like funky death and where does these
[SPEAKER_01]: things come from and I started to take a
look and I started to find out that
[SPEAKER_01]: farnesine which is Farnesol is the
precursor to all sesquiterpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but farnesine the the turp itself is The
death smell of aphids and so plants exude
[SPEAKER_01]: that smell to drive predation away from it
Because it smells like insect death and
[SPEAKER_01]: then if aphids die they release that odor
which then tells other aphids that their
[SPEAKER_01]: Death is present and they should hide and
so it started to drive some interest in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of you know are we picking up some
of these funky tones that are really
[SPEAKER_01]: bioprotectants and we're interpreting them
in a way that makes us perceive something
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I started to take a look at this
and We started to go through and we took a
[SPEAKER_01]: look and we find that geranyl is the
precursor for all the monoturps and
[SPEAKER_01]: farnesol is the precursor for all the
sesquiterps and I started to take a look
[SPEAKER_01]: and trying to understand you know What are
what are some of the reasons why this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff works?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we have some of these smells and
we've been talking about esters which are
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohols and we find that You have
alcohols that are glycycerides and
[SPEAKER_01]: glycycerides are make up fat and so Almost
all fats and animals and plants are from
[SPEAKER_01]: glycyrides and that is from esters And so
we start to say as we go back We always
[SPEAKER_01]: remember the sticky the oily the greasy
things that we don't see as much anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: things that don't have the same tactical
field same Constituents that make it up
[SPEAKER_01]: and in some of those things I think are
directly connected and so I started to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a little look deeper and As I started
to go into this I started to find that
[SPEAKER_01]: things like valencyne which is orange
Which you can smell so clearly in this you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't smell citrus in the sense of lemon
lime Through your hog flower, but you if
[SPEAKER_01]: you give it a squeeze You're gonna have
this sour garlic and you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: this underlying citrus tone But you can
smell a distinct orange over a lemon or
[SPEAKER_01]: lime and you have a muskiness that
typically would come from myrcine But when
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at the profile of a hog in an og
Limonine myrcine pionine and we'll use the
[SPEAKER_01]: pionine sample instead of the camphine and
because like I said, they smelled
[SPEAKER_01]: identical when you compared them but for
og cush Which is typically we would say
[SPEAKER_01]: limonine pionine myrcine dominant It
couldn't be any different than the hog and
[SPEAKER_01]: they both have similar profiles and so I
started going through this and I started
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to understand better like what
makes these things happen because we all
[SPEAKER_01]: become very Turp aware But they work in
combination in conjunction with each other
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's also conversions and what I
started to find was the valencyne which is
[SPEAKER_01]: this incredibly Valencia orange smell they
take valencyne and I had to write this
[SPEAKER_01]: down so I get the name straight but you
can use bacteria and they do this in
[SPEAKER_01]: perfume industry and other industries and
they use a bacteria and It converts
[SPEAKER_01]: valencyne to a newtcatone and so
newtcatone is the most valuable of all
[SPEAKER_01]: Grapefruit turps and so this incredibly
valuable grapefruit scent turp can be
[SPEAKER_01]: converted from valencyne by Logically and
so I started to take a look at you know
[SPEAKER_01]: What is what is garlic and why do we smell
it and why do we do and garlic is
[SPEAKER_01]: something called an allicin ester allicin
and It doesn't release its smell until you
[SPEAKER_01]: crush it But it's not because you've
volatized it as much as you've crushed it
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've released enzymes which then
react and Go to process and then release
[SPEAKER_01]: this So there's all these things that are
taking place in how we perceive Smells and
[SPEAKER_01]: tones and when we're looking at turp
reports and turp profiles, and I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: go through a bunch of these I'm gonna go
through a lot of these older over the next
[SPEAKER_01]: couple weeks as I get a chance I'll go
through some of these profiles pertaining
[SPEAKER_01]: to some of these older varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sifting through and What it'll do is
it'll let us kind of take a look at what's
[SPEAKER_01]: a turp profile compared to what's the
actual strain What do we really smell and
[SPEAKER_01]: when we look at these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we not see these odors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning that I should see with all the
pines and earths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should see a lot more In this thing,
but really what I have is a sour funk a
[SPEAKER_01]: garlicky tone and underlying orange and a
little bit of earth and it would make
[SPEAKER_01]: sense because we have so many earthy turps
pro present but The irony was when I
[SPEAKER_01]: started to compare all these profiles I
started to see such similarities between
[SPEAKER_01]: things that we have now and things that we
had in the past and it's primarily these
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohols that make these differences in
the strains that were from the past and
[SPEAKER_01]: now that we know that these esters are
directly related to the fat production in
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and animals This thing starts to
make sense because we remember these
[SPEAKER_01]: strains being so sticky and so greasy and
we assumed sticky from resins but perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky from fats and So as we mine back
through these older strains and go dig
[SPEAKER_01]: through these profiles I'll go and take a
look through the turp profiles and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: start to try to understand better What are
we looking at and a lot of it is so that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can understand?
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes it attractive and what doesn't
otherwise it's just basically these simple
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles Of this this and this drive and
attraction this this and this give us a
[SPEAKER_01]: desire total amounts solely dictate
desirability and in a lot of cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just not true and It it becomes
confusing and misleading to us in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: production and when people start to look
at cannabinoid profiles and then turpinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles and that becomes the the basis of
the decision-making process It's not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily very accurate in terms of how
we perceive it through the mouth and
[SPEAKER_01]: through the nose and so I spent some time
just over the Christmas break having a few
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes to hang out and I just went
through and listed this stuff and went
[SPEAKER_01]: through and started trying to understand
you know, why do we have some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: orders that we do and why do we not and
Trying to understand the subtleties in it
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's always the subtlety that
determines quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gross characteristics It's always
the fine details both cars of cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both get you from point A to B one of
them has a better Experience and so we
[SPEAKER_01]: would typically consider that the better
car It's the same with cannabis Whichever
[SPEAKER_01]: one gives you the best experience how you
perceive it what it it does for you in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of medical usage spiritual usage
however, we want to define it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but all those characteristics are from
perception and When it comes to smell
[SPEAKER_01]: we're so nuanced through the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a direct connection from brains
brain stem to nostril that It's primal it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes all the way back and so we've been
keyed to smell and understand so many
[SPEAKER_01]: things But with cannabis we've been necked
into some populations now and there's this
[SPEAKER_01]: drive to bring out higher louder strains
and louder just meaning More visible to
[SPEAKER_01]: the nostril quickly which means more
aromatic at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's more volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's more monoterpene derived and We
have so many of these Varietals now that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're working in those directions but
ultimately is it is it giving you an
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyable experience and does it give you
the effect that you desire from that Terp
[SPEAKER_01]: profile and a lot of the information when
you get into terpenes is bioprotectants on
[SPEAKER_01]: how it affects against tumors and cancer
and bone loss and Tooth decay and I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: it's unlimited what you can do with this
But because none of this has been studied
[SPEAKER_01]: in a smokable form always in applied to a
thing It doesn't really apply to us in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Extrapolating data from one set and
putting it on another and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: pretending that it's accurate and we
really know that's not the case and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really more a matter of trying to
understand how do you interpret the the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid profiles the turpinoid
profiles and also these esters these
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohols that was so dominant and present
in these cannabis varieties from the past
[SPEAKER_01]: that Released such an incredible smell
that was so distinctive to all people that
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually these varieties had to get
removed from the system and so It's this
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding that I'm trying to find as
to what drove such an incredible desire in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis from those types and how do we
get back into some of those exotic forms
[SPEAKER_01]: of Cannabinoid combinations and turpinoid
alcohol combinations so that we can get
[SPEAKER_01]: back into some of that desirability on a
different direction and It's we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: working the same populations that we're
working which are primarily right now so
[SPEAKER_01]: much of the og directions and I was just
so fascinated with because if we when we
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about you know, the mere scene pining
lime anywhere It's uplifting and then
[SPEAKER_01]: brings you down The hog strains skunk
strains couldn't be any it could be any
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite in terms of where they lift you
up But they don't bring you down They
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have that same type of sedative
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though the mere scene level and this
is relatively high It's you know double
[SPEAKER_01]: the pines even more than the croffling
levels the only thing that the the hog had
[SPEAKER_01]: that was really high was trans neural adal
and CIS neural adal and so between the two
[SPEAKER_01]: of them you were looking at almost you
know for four and a half percent and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's citrusy alcohol Rose that's barky
woody and all these complex tones that
[SPEAKER_01]: come into these varieties that make them
taste so so green and green meaning,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know subtleties of the of the earth
and the forest within and we can pull out
[SPEAKER_01]: some specific little pieces and I would
say, you know, you have some hoppy taste
[SPEAKER_01]: and some wheatgrass or some lemongrass
present that beautiful Subtle orange tone
[SPEAKER_01]: mere scene is always this this earthy
component that when we cross This and
[SPEAKER_01]: volatile it volatile it we can get it to
come out But so much of it is is in my
[SPEAKER_01]: mind now as I see that we're having
biological conversions of alcohols to
[SPEAKER_01]: other substances we're having enzymatic
conversions of Something to something so
[SPEAKER_01]: if garlic is an enzymatic conversion to a
scent then Maybe we need to rethink how we
[SPEAKER_01]: approach the smell components of Canada's
and I'm not a terpene scientist I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: fortunate enough to get to listen to them
frequently, but I'm somebody who's trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand Where is the the desire in
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do people like to go when it comes
to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is the directions of cannabis and
This entire population from that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that late 80 early 90 time period
prior to really smell BC before charcoal
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that was this incredible cannabis
population that was still globally
[SPEAKER_01]: Developed meaning that the the world had
produced all these different cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties and they had been clustered into
these cannabis zones and Those zones of
[SPEAKER_01]: production created these varieties and
then lo and behold as we go forward the
[SPEAKER_01]: demand of the customer drives what people
have but black market forced some radical
[SPEAKER_01]: changes because there was a limit and what
cannabis was available and Cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: was coming over at that time from say the
remnants of Columbia the remnants of
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico that cannabis was so much lower
quality than the indoor produced in
[SPEAKER_01]: California that even though the end up
from California had these reduced smell
[SPEAKER_01]: traits because we had turned them down You
still received a better higher quality
[SPEAKER_01]: product than what was available So the
market became accustomed to that and then
[SPEAKER_01]: as we start to go into medical marijuana
and move forward all of a sudden we had
[SPEAKER_01]: the ability to produce cannabis again in a
protected manner which allowed us then to
[SPEAKER_01]: have cannabis that was inherently louder
more distinct a higher signature and That
[SPEAKER_01]: brought the awareness back of hey was all
this good smelly stuff we had when we were
[SPEAKER_01]: younger and So we we go back and we
realize we've necked all these things out
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I've been on this hunt to pull
stuff from that time period back from
[SPEAKER_01]: globally and Try to locate these varieties
so that we could go into them and start to
[SPEAKER_01]: say what creates these smells really we're
all looking for the skunk pee But the we
[SPEAKER_01]: and we want it but we want the skunk pee
on a better chassis the skunk pee that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're so caught up with in terms of skunk
It was always on the leafiest Cabbagey
[SPEAKER_01]: looking stuff you've ever seen in your
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never on really solid flowers very
very rarely primarily in a different type
[SPEAKER_01]: of morphological bud characteristic and So
I don't know if I'm so much seeking to go
[SPEAKER_01]: back But I'm going to seek into those
tones because it was also stunning other
[SPEAKER_01]: varietals the burnt rubbers the The heavy
citrus pines that were just dominant you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see any of that anymore not to the
same degree No OG is piney like strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that were piney and we Just don't see
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're moderated something's controlling
these these connections on how you
[SPEAKER_01]: perceive it and so I think that as we go
forward and we start to dig and look
[SPEAKER_01]: through the reports and then take a look
at the cannabis and actually consume and
[SPEAKER_01]: test and say hey What do we see and what
don't we see it starts become very
[SPEAKER_01]: informative because when I had two samples
run that were almost identical in almost
[SPEAKER_01]: all Characteristics little fluctuations,
but in piney and canteen no canteen in one
[SPEAKER_01]: no piney and the other But you couldn't
put the you could put the flowers in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same container and no one could tell the
difference So it started to really make me
[SPEAKER_01]: realize you know that some of these things
that are so characteristically known are
[SPEAKER_01]: either subdued or enhanced by other
terpenes and what alcohols are present and
[SPEAKER_01]: the degree that the alcohol is present and
that would be from a lot of it from the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing conditions the inputs obviously
because it changed profiles here and You
[SPEAKER_01]: know your harvest time and the cure
windows and all these different pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: that control it but it's going to be
interesting as we go forward because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to start to be able to take a look
at profiles and start to find some really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting markers so that when we get
into breeding and we're able to start to
[SPEAKER_01]: mark for some of these terpene indicators
and look through genetically Do we have
[SPEAKER_01]: these markers we should be able to start
to go back into some of these plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: were extremely high in these volatile
esters and alcohols which are
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptionally attractive but very hard to
mine you won't see it in concentrates
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the volatility and It just
starts to help us understand better what
[SPEAKER_01]: it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're producing what it is We're trying to
market to the public and when people want
[SPEAKER_01]: you know unique varieties It's unique
because why what defines unique and so
[SPEAKER_01]: much of this is being able to take your
Varietals and say they're unique because
[SPEAKER_01]: people like them for this it has an
applicability here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a demand for it this way Not just
it has higher content than others because
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately that doesn't really Numerically
it does make a difference on a shelf but
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of how people perceive it
radically different and so when I spent
[SPEAKER_01]: the last you know half a day trying to
understand where's the smell of garlic
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from when I don't have any garlic
terpenes or alcohols present in the
[SPEAKER_01]: testing and we're only looking at a
Truncated test it might be say like 30 and
[SPEAKER_01]: there might be over 200 possible But those
will be at levels that will be so small it
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's catalyst things that change
things things that precursors things that
[SPEAKER_01]: set things in motion and so as we go
forward and we start to really have a more
[SPEAKER_01]: in-depth test and we're able to look at
this a little different we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: start going in and moving some of these
populations in these directions I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: and for me right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a fascinating time to be able to
see this and do this and Actually have the
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to understand what made some of
these things so attractive versus just it
[SPEAKER_01]: had a smell that was this but Because we
are having a hell of a time trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: replicate it if skunk was easy to
replicate you would see Terpene blenders
[SPEAKER_01]: blending it and it would be present as a
turp to add to things But I don't see
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk piss on anything right now Period so
I know that some of these things are
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptionally hard to capture or create
and it's what made some of these varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: so attractive and that's what that's
what's fun right now as we get to hunt and
[SPEAKER_01]: do so the hog you got me curious because
your smell is unique and I feel the life
[SPEAKER_01]: of me could not figure out where it came
from so Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for attracting me so much that I
put the effort in and I hope this video
[SPEAKER_01]: shines a little light on the chase of
where these things come from and remember
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a organic chemist and I don't
claim to be one and nor do I want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: one but I'm someone who's fascinated with
genetics and what makes something
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable and in these things we start to
have desirability just like when we look
[SPEAKER_01]: in in cannabinoid profiles we can start to
find out that these cannabinoids influence
[SPEAKER_01]: the way the body accepts other
cannabinoids and it directly affects how
[SPEAKER_01]: you perceive this effect because it is
absolutely giving you an effect and the
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of that allows you to better
tailor in what you're seeking so that as
[SPEAKER_01]: we move into these different populations
of people come in you're able to give them
[SPEAKER_01]: better choices and more accurate choices
and then they are able to understand why
[SPEAKER_01]: they made the choices which lets us drive
directions of breeding and plant choices
[SPEAKER_01]: towards those directions so that we're not
