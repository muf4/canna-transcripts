[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Seveal Agrawal is a physician,
scientist, and medical geographer.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is a fellow of the American Academy of
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is presently palliative medicine
physician and associate hospice medical
[SPEAKER_07]: director at MultiCare Medical Center in
Auburn, Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: An NIH medical scientist training program
fellowship awardee, Dr. Agrawal received
[SPEAKER_07]: his PhD in 2008 and MD in 2012.
[SPEAKER_07]: He received his PhD in 2010 from the
University of Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: He has published over two dozen
peer-reviewed articles and chapters.
[SPEAKER_07]: As an NSF graduate research fellow,
he wrote a PhD dissertation entitled,
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medical Geography and Cannabinoid
Botanicals in Washington State Access,
[SPEAKER_07]: Delivery, and Distress.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2009, Dr. Agrawal successfully led the
effort to get the American Medical
[SPEAKER_07]: Association to call for a review of the
scheduling classification of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: the first such statement in 72 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: He serves on the editorial advisory board
of the National Cancer Institute TBQ
[SPEAKER_07]: Cancer Camp Information Summary on
cannabis and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is an affiliated faculty of the
MultiCare Institute for Research and
[SPEAKER_07]: Innovation and an invited affiliate
assistant professor at the UW Department
[SPEAKER_07]: of Geography and an associate member of
the Humboldt Institute for
[SPEAKER_07]: Interdisciplinary Marijuana Research.
[SPEAKER_07]: He is an honorary trustee of the Medical
Cannabis Foundation of India and vice
[SPEAKER_07]: president of the Washington Physicians for
Social Responsibility.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, he's going to talk about the
history of cannabis and humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is my honor to welcome Dr. Neil
Agrawal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So great to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard about the Vyman meetings for
like years.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way back when I was in New York
and I've been waiting for years to come
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm really, really happy to finally
get a chance to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dominic Corvo, wherever he is,
he first started telling me about these
[SPEAKER_04]: meetings and I would see pictures of this
strange hall and it just was what a scene,
[SPEAKER_04]: what a place to talk about cannabis and a
place which is traditionally set for
[SPEAKER_04]: people to exchange farming, things that
they've grown together and be with others
[SPEAKER_04]: socially.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was mind blowing and it really is mind
blowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for letting me be here
tonight and I just wanted to, I guess,
[SPEAKER_04]: Kao Shego and I had had a conversation
about some broad strokes about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: geography, and humans and he said,
listen, you should tell us more about that
[SPEAKER_04]: in this session, in this setting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I want to share with you
all tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to give a great homage to my
mentor and friend, Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without him, I would not have gotten that
PhD in the University of Washington
[SPEAKER_04]: because he was on my supervisory
committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's to Ethan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much of what I'm going to share with you,
much of this information was really not
[SPEAKER_04]: well put together and collected until
Ethan Russo sat down and actually called
[SPEAKER_04]: it and catalogued it, summarized it for
people to read all around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this has to be said, so let's give him
another round of applause.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, I was very nervous about
meeting here, but I told him, please,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to give him any alternative
facts tonight, so please.
[SPEAKER_04]: So geography is my special medical
specialty or at least social science
[SPEAKER_04]: specialty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Medical geography is a subgroup in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in geography, we've always studied
human-plant relationships as one facet of
[SPEAKER_04]: how humans shape the environment of planet
Earth and our space and environment around
[SPEAKER_04]: us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was always very interested in the
concept of questions about how cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: came here to this space that we all occupy
together and how something that was
[SPEAKER_04]: evolved on planet Earth came to seem
socially so alien.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so socially marginalized and all that
stuff, demonized, all the things that
[SPEAKER_04]: we've been dealing with for all these,
just actually a century or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although if you go back in the 13th
century, there was attempts to prohibit
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis in some parts of the Muslim world
at the time, very poor Muslim world,
[SPEAKER_04]: but those didn't succeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it won't succeed this time either.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the question I had was, in those days,
nobody ever tried to eradicate it with the
[SPEAKER_04]: degree of ferocity of the Drug Enforcement
Administration in the United States and
[SPEAKER_04]: their literal crop pulling, all that
physical labor involved in trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: eradicate something that's
wind-pollinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you really have to really have a
lot of money and a lot of heart to go
[SPEAKER_04]: after something that spreads like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did we get into that situation?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm from Oklahoma.
That's where I'm born and raised,
which had the most draconian marijuana
laws in the Western Hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we don't share a death penalty
stuff that Indonesia and Malaysia and
[SPEAKER_04]: China and other places have.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll put you in jail for life for
growing one plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that was on the books for a
while.
[SPEAKER_04]: And life sentences were passed just a few
years ago, signed by the current governor
[SPEAKER_04]: for making hashish.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we actually have, their
decriminalization policies on cannabis are
[SPEAKER_04]: actually more ahead of Washington state in
terms of the possession amount that's
[SPEAKER_04]: decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still, it's still a very,
very different game there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's still a lot of ways to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, that's what I knew growing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really, so in my body, in my brain,
cannabis was really, really, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, we know otherwise.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's, what I want to share with you
is a little bit about what researchers,
[SPEAKER_04]: geographers, a really great geography
researcher at the University of New
[SPEAKER_04]: Mexico, he was reading a book called
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, his name is Chris Duvall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's an associate professor in the
Department of Geography at the University
[SPEAKER_04]: of New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot highly, I can't more highly
recommend this book.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look how beautiful some of the interior
designs are.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really a beautiful book physically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have no financial stake or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just telling you, this is,
of all the books that I got to see when I
[SPEAKER_04]: was doing my research days, none that I've
seen put together all the different pieces
[SPEAKER_04]: in such a nice way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing that this book does that you
will not find in many other volumes on
[SPEAKER_04]: histories and geographies of cannabis is
it talks about the use of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_04]: Africa, which is a widely neglected area
of research and study.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's completely unusual and surprising
and kind of colonialist because smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis was invented in Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he has unequivocal evidence towards
that fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: When drug cannabis cultures went from
India, South Asia, to parts of Africa,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's where the smoking had already been
developed for other herbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where he believes that
cannabis smoking began, which is what we
[SPEAKER_04]: were just talking about a few minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, that's something that's really
worth looking at because we really need to
[SPEAKER_04]: get our brains around actually cannabis'
role in global societies, internationally
[SPEAKER_04]: and historically, so we can actually stake
our social commonwealth claim towards it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my moral two cents about the thing
because if you don't, if you don't claim
[SPEAKER_04]: it, you're gonna lose it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true for any of our rights in
society.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think at this day and age,
everybody wants to stake a claim.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what, cannabis was well there
and around well before we even entered the
[SPEAKER_04]: scene, evolutionarily speaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is what's really interesting,
this evolutionary story of actually how
[SPEAKER_04]: this cannabis plant came to even evolve in
the way that we come to know and love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it all starts in the pre-mordial
landmass called Laurasia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before the Indian subcontinent crashed
into, through plate tectonics,
[SPEAKER_04]: collided with the Asian landmass,
there was a continent called Laurasia.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is actually where we believe the
ancestral cannabis, the central part of
[SPEAKER_04]: that, where it evolved, began to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's really interesting is that it
was really due to the interactions of that
[SPEAKER_04]: ancestral cannabis with the physical
environment that it was in, i.e.
[SPEAKER_04]: elevation, climate, exposure to the sun,
this is how the different varieties of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis that we know in two major
categories developed.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what the prevailing theories are
in geology and geography of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happened was this is kind of in
between the time of the evolution of this
[SPEAKER_04]: nettles and hops.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the two plants that are most
closely related on either side to this
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're talking about somewhere in the
range of 30 plus million years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, humans are, I don't know,
some hominids would go a couple million,
[SPEAKER_04]: two million, you know, so we're going way
back before any of that stuff was going
[SPEAKER_04]: on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nettles originated about 55 million
years ago, and humulus, or hops,
[SPEAKER_04]: distinguished itself six and a half
million years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So somewhere in that window is where
cannabis is windowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that area of Central Asia,
on that landscape, there was some
[SPEAKER_04]: highlands over there, but they weren't
that high in elevation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what started to happen is that,
you know, due to the movement of the
[SPEAKER_04]: earth's plates, this Asian Indian landmass
began to collide with the landmass of
[SPEAKER_04]: Asia, and those cannabis plants became
exposed to increasingly higher elevations
[SPEAKER_04]: over a period of millions and millions of
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very disruptive event in the
history of planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It led to the creation of the largest
landlocked area of land on planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's whole Central Asia area.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no, prior to that, many of those
places had exposure to ocean, but no
[SPEAKER_04]: longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This had huge impacts on climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It led to the evolution of the monsoon,
and this plant sort of caused a separation
[SPEAKER_04]: of two different varieties, two different
separate areas of evolution for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: One that was in the area of what we now
know as the Hindu Kush Mountains in
[SPEAKER_04]: western Himalayas, and one that was
further to the north.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the T-I-E-N islands.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some area in that part,
a little closer to the north.
[SPEAKER_04]: Further to the north.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's really interesting is that what we
know is that as cannabis became more
[SPEAKER_04]: exposed to higher elevations and lower
latitudes, UVB radiation becomes more
[SPEAKER_04]: prevalent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a fact of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to survive in high land
areas, you're going to have to be exposed
[SPEAKER_04]: to the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: UV radiation can be toxic to your DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can cause DNA damage, which can lead to
mutations, which can be toxic.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to develop a survival mechanism,
and that's one theory as to why we think
[SPEAKER_04]: that abundance of cannabinoids began to be
developed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ecological explanation to ward off
insects and things like that, people don't
[SPEAKER_04]: think that that explains fully enough what
this was a law for.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk separately about why this
particular class of compounds and not
[SPEAKER_04]: other compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turpenes also have interesting properties
to, when they are aromatized, they can see
[SPEAKER_04]: clouds like pyrene, limonene, and this
cloud cover can also help to prevent sun
[SPEAKER_04]: exposure, as we all know in the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is another thing going on,
but this is kind of a big moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabis stands that were further to
the north, what happened there,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was different ages and shifts in the
glacial ages.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're now in the Pleistocene era.
[SPEAKER_04]: In between two interglacial periods,
people talk about cannabis really had to
[SPEAKER_04]: become a little bit more into the
grasslands, into the plains areas to
[SPEAKER_04]: survive in that area, and more closer to
rivers, which is different from what was
[SPEAKER_04]: going on in the south, further south,
which was more into the mountainous
[SPEAKER_04]: regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: This kind of created two separate
evolutionary environmental pressures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowadays, and it was Dr. Russo who first
showed this to me, genetics is what we use
[SPEAKER_04]: to try to distinguish our cannabis species
to figure out.
[SPEAKER_04]: In dogs, we can say what's a chihuahua and
what's a doberman just by looking at it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but cannabis was always such a thing where
you really had to get close, up close and
[SPEAKER_04]: personal, at least humans did,
to find out what's what.
[SPEAKER_04]: That really perplexed and confused people
for hundreds and hundreds of years,
[SPEAKER_04]: botanists and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everyone was exposed.
[SPEAKER_04]: When people saw cannabis, they would call
it one thing because they reminded them of
[SPEAKER_04]: their court plants, but it turned out to
be a drug plant, vice versa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all confusing, but Dr. Karl Hillig's
genetic analysis really tried to show that
[SPEAKER_04]: there probably are two distinct species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this is the origin of that
distinction.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all often used these terms,
indica and sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's folk uses of indica and sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's technical uses of indica and
sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there was a period where people
talked about ruderalis, but I think all of
[SPEAKER_04]: these things, you really have to just look
at it from a historical evolution
[SPEAKER_04]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one ancestral cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do interbreed, but this is how the
distinction arose.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other part of this story is
domestication, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis was doing this thing,
and then along comes homo sapiens sapiens.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some earliest evidence of uses,
and I can't remember exact dates here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some 30,000, 20,000 years-ish,
something in that range, is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere in that range, you start seeing
pollen of cannabis in Europe, and you
[SPEAKER_04]: start seeing pottery markings,
things like that twine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the exact years,
but there are various distinct
[SPEAKER_04]: domestication episodes that occur in Asia,
which is of course where it would
[SPEAKER_04]: naturally first occur, because that's
where cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The movement of cannabis from South Asia
across to East Asia into China we think
[SPEAKER_04]: was through hunter-gatherers moving
through this green belt that came across
[SPEAKER_04]: all of Asia into China.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really interesting to see how
people are moving with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were uses for seed, uses for fiber,
and then the idea of using heated cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: greens for drug effects is something that
comes, is involved in primordial,
[SPEAKER_04]: is the remnant of that we find in
primordial religious texts from
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoroastrians, Vedic societies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are mainly the existing written
texts that go further back, but there's
[SPEAKER_04]: current ongoing archeologic studies of a
civilization called the Harappa
[SPEAKER_04]: civilization, and this one thing called
Bactria complex, which is in like a place
[SPEAKER_04]: called Turin.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's now Turkistan and Turkmenistan sort
of region, you can find clay pots,
[SPEAKER_04]: small cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would have clay pots, and they would
have little sieves, and inside those clay
[SPEAKER_04]: pots you see remnants of ephedra,
cannabis, and I don't know how to say it,
[SPEAKER_04]: obium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those three things in drinks that people
drank and revered, and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the same pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a mix, you know, it's a mixed wine,
mixed drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, ephedra gives you stimulation,
opium, you know, samalas and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: a little activation as well, other sorts.
[SPEAKER_04]: This combination was possibly part of the
primordial soma that has been sung about
[SPEAKER_04]: for centuries, or haoma in other texts in
Persia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was a drug complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was not around, you know,
cannabis to starve for famine,
[SPEAKER_04]: or cannabis to make my shoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was cannabis to bring me relief from
distress, anxiety, and closer to divinity,
[SPEAKER_04]: spirituality, spiritual development.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in different parts of Asia,
you saw different developments of these
[SPEAKER_04]: types of cultures, and sometimes there was
more drug and less of the threat and the
[SPEAKER_04]: utilization, and sometimes it was the
other way around, but this these areas,
[SPEAKER_04]: Indica was all about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: European cultures that developed around
the stand of cannabis that came from the
[SPEAKER_04]: northern population, you know,
cannabis was more in the realm of cloth
[SPEAKER_04]: and fiber.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was described by Herodotus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Herodotus was, for ancient Greek
historians, the first references you see.
[SPEAKER_04]: The very famous thing is the whole
Scythian, I don't know if you guys know,
[SPEAKER_04]: whoever reads this stuff, the Scythian
funeral rites of using hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throwing on flames of people who guessed
that maybe that was also psychoactive,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we don't really know for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other thing that he mentions is
that cannabis fiber was used in threats,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a, you know, that itself tells
you that there was a development of a
[SPEAKER_04]: fiber textile industry around hemp
cannabis in ancient Greece at times,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then spread with the Romans and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cannabis was about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some medical uses described for
hemp seeds and texts for ear infections.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the oil from ear, from seeds,
but, you know, they didn't know much about
[SPEAKER_04]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess a lot of fascinating
developments happened in South Asian
[SPEAKER_04]: cultures around cannabis, but really we
don't hear much about it until the 1500s,
[SPEAKER_04]: because this again, this is the moment
when Portuguese sailors land in modern day
[SPEAKER_04]: South Asia and start noticing people
drinking this thing called banca,
[SPEAKER_04]: B-A-N-G-U-E, they call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was something that they
associated with underclasses, people who
[SPEAKER_04]: were doing labor, people who were cooking,
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the sailors started to use it
too, and they said, well, this makes me
[SPEAKER_04]: laugh, this makes me hungry, this is
interesting, what is this stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually some nice quotes in here
about the very first sailor who came
[SPEAKER_04]: across this, and he said, it looks like
the stuff we have back home, but it really
isn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, these moments start to show
Europeans that there's this other type of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, and it starts to spread from
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start getting also more English
sailors start coming, a guy named,
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot his name right now, he was in Sri
Lanka, and he found cannabis was being
[SPEAKER_04]: used indigenously, and he found that when
he had terrible GI upset, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: from all the exposure to different types
of bacteria and water that he's drinking
[SPEAKER_04]: there compared to what he has in Europe,
that he could use cannabis and he would
[SPEAKER_04]: still get an appetite and, you know,
not end up wasting away from diarrhea that
[SPEAKER_04]: would normally otherwise kill you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was interesting to him,
he brought seeing back to the one and only
[SPEAKER_04]: Robert Hook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody know Robert Hook?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, beside me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, yes, he is the father of the
Mard microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is one of the founders of, you know,
one of the great scientists in the history
[SPEAKER_04]: of Western medicine, Newton's competitor,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was Newton and there was,
you know, of course we remember Newton,
[SPEAKER_04]: but Hook was really a major player on the
scene in Europe, in England, in the Royal
[SPEAKER_04]: Society, the first president, I believe,
of the Royal Society, which still exists
[SPEAKER_04]: to this day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he started growing cannabis from the
seeds that this other guy brought.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't do too well currently, but he also
tried using some of the cannabis that he
[SPEAKER_04]: had.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is the first Western scientist to
methodically cultivate, consume,
[SPEAKER_04]: and describe the effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this guy, is literally one of the most
famous books in the history of
[SPEAKER_04]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_04]: He basically tripped out a whole lot of
Europeans because he showed everyone what
[SPEAKER_04]: a protozoa looked like or an amoeba.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a very bizarre new thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: His book was very popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is how cannabis becomes a thing
in, you know, English-speaking world,
[SPEAKER_04]: anglophone world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was through these exposures from
colonial sailors to South Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a lot of cross-pollination starts
happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the ships of Portuguese sailed around
the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oftentimes you'd have Africans and South
Asians and different classes of people
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to survive on these boats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was one thing, the way that
people were cross-exposed to the use of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I already told you about the African
story.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had spread first in the eastern
part of Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it took really, I think it was
somewhere in the 1600s or so that you got
[SPEAKER_04]: to the western part of Africa,
kind of in the area of South Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And South Africa in Namibia.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really it didn't extend beyond Sudan
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is like what people are starting
to put together when you try to put all
[SPEAKER_04]: the different historical records together,
all the physical evidences.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see these distinct patterns of
migration of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's really, really interesting is when
it starts to get out to this part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: north of the earth, you know, it was
really through the transatlantic slave
[SPEAKER_04]: trade, indentured systems of colonial
labor practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis was always associated with menial
work relief.
[SPEAKER_04]: People who did menial jobs and who didn't
have a lot of self-say in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis was something that was used to
help to deal with the knot.
[SPEAKER_04]: This famously entered into the popular
American discourse in the 70s when well,
[SPEAKER_04]: if anybody was reading, the medical
anthropologist went to Jamaica and studied
[SPEAKER_04]: the use of cannabis in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Melanie Dreher and a few other folks I
can't remember all their names.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this was a time when people were
saying, oh, cannabis makes you lazy and
[SPEAKER_04]: a-motivated.
[SPEAKER_04]: There they would find workers and say,
hey, without cannabis I can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it makes me motivated to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very confusing to people because
we've been taught so long that it led to
[SPEAKER_04]: this state of apathy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here you have more extant cultures
that came from those, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Caribbean, agrarian work where it was just
the opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a little bit of how things kind
of seeped in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have heard more of the stories
about Mexican migration and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other part of the story I want to
share with you is kind of the history of
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine because a lot of these things are
forgotten.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't really talk about how
cannabis made its way into the most
[SPEAKER_04]: revered pharmaceutical houses and in the
books of the most established and
[SPEAKER_04]: prestigious physicians in the history of
modern medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just think, oh, you know,
this is something that we heard about in
[SPEAKER_04]: the 1960s and 70s when people had severe
symptoms of cancer and HIV and then,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course, glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those three are really how people think
that cannabis as medicine became a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, and this is a lot of people's
work, has shown multiple uses of cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: in various systems of medicine,
traditional Chinese medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So traditional stuff we know about,
traditional Chinese medicine, Unani,
[SPEAKER_04]: TB, forms of Persian medicine,
the very famous Dr. Ibn Sena, Ibn Sena,
[SPEAKER_04]: also called Abhi Sena in the West,
same guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you look at the government of India's
traditional knowledge digital library
[SPEAKER_04]: where they try to catalog all their plants
so that somebody doesn't come in Monsanto,
[SPEAKER_04]: their traditional crops, which has been
tried multiple, multiple times,
[SPEAKER_04]: such as neem and turmeric have been
attempted to be monopolized by western
[SPEAKER_04]: companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe I've heard that cannabis was
also attempted.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what they started to do is create a
digital library.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's traditional prior use.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got this prior use, prior use,
prior use.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an entry in there for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they cite for their traditional,
here's our prior use, is the textbook of
[SPEAKER_04]: Abhi Sena from the 11th century.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a really interesting reason they
cite this book is because this book of
[SPEAKER_04]: Arabic medicine was what they used in
medieval Europe to teach medicine when
[SPEAKER_04]: there was no medicine besides leeches and
bloodletting or whatever they did in
[SPEAKER_04]: medieval middle ages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't mean to be completely split,
but that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Arabs got it from the Greeks and the
Arabs maintained it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Expanded it and then gave it back to the
Europeans.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the citation they use.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a small reference to cannabis
in the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, it wasn't as widely known until
the 1800s or the 19th century when these
[SPEAKER_04]: modern physicians were coming to Calcutta.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where Dr. Rashaughnessy,
which we all know about Rashaughnessy's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone knows about Rashaughnessy's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rashaughnessy's is the name taken by,
for the group of California medical
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis doctors since 1996.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. McAreata's group, he was the
grandfather of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also extracted all his old literature.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's now passed away in 2007, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: He passed away from liver cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, he named his group Rashaughnessy's
because he wanted to pay homage to this
[SPEAKER_04]: Irish physician who was so brilliant that
he actually, you know, learned cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: from the natives in Calcutta and used it
on his patients to treat things like
[SPEAKER_04]: rabies and sage rabies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you get to a phase where the rabies
goes into your central nervous system and
[SPEAKER_04]: you can't drink anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't eat anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're extremely like, you just like waste
away and everything you try to put in your
[SPEAKER_04]: mouth, you spit out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would give cannabis grains to those
patients and they would be able to start
[SPEAKER_04]: eating oranges and have more relaxation
and fall asleep and then pass away
[SPEAKER_04]: comfortably.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave it to patients who had tetanus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really advanced stages of tetanus where
you were just stiff and you could kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: relax them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some infantile cases.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he writes it all up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gives it to animals and medical
students who said, this is an amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm going to make my name for
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually didn't make his name on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He made his name on something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: He laid the telegraph lines in India and
ignited for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, he had a previous amazing
thing where he figured out how to eye
[SPEAKER_04]: dehydrate people, cholera victims.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a medical student, people were dying of
dehydration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, why don't you put
electrolytes in the fluids and put that in
[SPEAKER_04]: their veins and maybe they'll survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he wrote those ideas down and that's,
of course, current data.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this guy was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was a really interesting fellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't hear about it at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, why is he not taught in medical
studies?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was a cannabis thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So his introduction into the modern
medicine of cannabis really excited all
[SPEAKER_04]: sorts of people in Europe and back in the
UK and Ohio.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see there was meetings in the 1850s
of Ohio doctors just after he published in
[SPEAKER_04]: 1840 something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people were really interested in what
was going on in India.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a great treatment for
neurological disorders and for pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just talking about migraines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Rousseau wrote it beforehand.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a doctor at the New York
Neurological Society named Seguin.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the president of the society.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said it's the most superior treatment
that he knows for migraine headaches.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dr. Willie Mosler, the father of
internal medicine who founded Johns
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopkins University and started rounding.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you hear about white coat
doctors going around the hospital with
[SPEAKER_04]: rounding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's what Dr. Osler did,
came up with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he wrote about that in his textbook.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the treatment that you've got
to use for migraine headaches.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another doctor who invented
ophthalmoscopy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, looking into your, you know,
when the doctor puts up into your eye and
[SPEAKER_04]: looks into your retina and sees if there's
any illness there, what the blood vessels
[SPEAKER_04]: look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: The doctor who had routinely started
introducing that into medical practice,
[SPEAKER_04]: he was a big fan of the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the doctors who first started to
distinguish the different types of
[SPEAKER_04]: epilepsy, more generalized versus related
to an injury, he was a big fan of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The doctor who was one of the early
researchers of Parkinson's disease,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the pointer of Parkinson's
disease, but somebody who did some major
[SPEAKER_04]: work, he also talked about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of really advanced,
top-notch physicians in the UK and in the
[SPEAKER_04]: United States or in Canada who,
for them, cannabis was a very unique and
[SPEAKER_04]: important part of the medical
pharmacopoeia.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was even a brown, there's a syndrome
we call, there's some things in medical
[SPEAKER_04]: school.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many medical students say,
hey, what do you call a patient who has a
[SPEAKER_04]: spinal cord injury that's only halfway
done?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one half of the cord is cut,
the other half is okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes that happens in injuries,
motorcycle vehicle accidents.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called a brown C-cord syndrome,
brown C-cord syndrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where one side of the body has one
deformity, the other side has another.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Brown C-cord had his own cannabis
preparation named for him, cannabis and a
[SPEAKER_04]: few other things in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I tried to tell those to the students
and doctors I talked to to let them know
[SPEAKER_04]: this is actually the names, Osler and all
these names are in our current textbooks
[SPEAKER_04]: and teachings.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these doctors saw cannabis as
something that was an important part of
[SPEAKER_04]: their pharmacopoeia.
[SPEAKER_04]: We unfortunately lost it due to an
inability to understand what it was,
[SPEAKER_04]: the rising prominence of pharmaceutical
houses, the consolidation of power by
[SPEAKER_04]: professionals, et cetera, and the closure
of certain alternative medical practices
[SPEAKER_04]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a bunch of forces, not to
mention the old-fashioned racism and
[SPEAKER_04]: xenophobia and all things that we are
still dealing with until 2017.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things were probably worse back
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so, but it's not the science,
it's not through, but this is not,
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis medicine was not a recent
discovery.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of, it was never alien.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was always tracking along different
groups in society that may or may not have
[SPEAKER_04]: maintained a level of civility or
respectability.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're changing all of that now,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've kind of gotten into a very new place
with cannabis and I think my message,
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably need to line down or take some
questions or something, but I guess where
[SPEAKER_07]: I can... You've got a good 15 minutes to
keep talking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me take this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I want to tell you about this whole,
where I see that, so let me give a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of a moral or, I don't know,
an idea to think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if cannabis has so many fingers,
pretty of course prior to human evolution
[SPEAKER_04]: and beyond, so many fingers in so many
different civilities, civilizations
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the eons and who actually gets
to say at the end of the day that they get
[SPEAKER_04]: the rightful prominence over that species?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anybody could really claim
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If one person claims it, everybody has to
claim it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really can't choose.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was never any prior owner and that's
for me a very important lesson to draw
[SPEAKER_04]: from that when we're talking social policy
and we're talking about who has access to
[SPEAKER_04]: the means of production, to use the old
term from Marx.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the, this human plant
relationship is not a imaginary or trivial
[SPEAKER_04]: or kind of a hippie new age concept or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fundamental to how we have
actually interacted with our planet and
[SPEAKER_04]: the things in it and that we ignore it at
our peril.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the fact that we don't even
talk about it is because we have become so
[SPEAKER_04]: commodified in our society that we are so
just removed from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean there are variations on that,
that things have changed, but I think we
[SPEAKER_04]: think, always think about cannabis in that
already sort of process ready to go away
[SPEAKER_04]: and the fact that we don't pay attention
to that ground level upside of things is
[SPEAKER_04]: why I think we never developed a
legalization of production for all of us
[SPEAKER_04]: in this state.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean there's other histories on that,
but it would have been unthinkable if you
[SPEAKER_04]: had imagined cannabis legalization in
other times in history that that didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: fundamentally mean being able to cultivate
and doing all that in your space or your
[SPEAKER_04]: community space.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is an interesting kind of thing to
come out of this moral from this and I
[SPEAKER_04]: think this issue of monopolization or,
I also like the term oligopolization.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys know these long words,
but these are really ways to talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: few people owned or one person owned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mono or oligo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that is the whole way that
cannabis diffused in around the world was
[SPEAKER_04]: because multiple people owned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just one or two or three, but like the
most marginal person in society who's
[SPEAKER_04]: stuck on his slave ship going someplace
they know not and they bring with them a
[SPEAKER_04]: few seeds from what their homeland is to
produce there, whether they're indentured
[SPEAKER_04]: or getting no pay at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the kind of people that owned
cannabis and that's why we have cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not because we had a billion
dollars of extra money sitting around or
[SPEAKER_04]: had with the son of the king or whatever
it would have been back then would be the
[SPEAKER_04]: equivalent of privilege today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's really an interesting thing
to think about when you wonder who is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to own cannabis in North America or
in the global society today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm really interested in cannabis as an
aphrodisiac, sexual aid for women after
[SPEAKER_09]: menopause when they kind of lose interest
in sex.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been trying to research that however
I can and of course the Indian tantric
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of position, they talk about paying
for what they should be using,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is a drink that you said.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what do you think that's the drink?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they not smoking it then?
[SPEAKER_09]: You mentioned you give the sailors some of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, modern use on cannabis
sexuality.
[SPEAKER_04]: A really great talk is by Dr. Jordan
Tischler, T-I-S-H-C-L-E-R.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave a talk at Green Flower Media
Cannabis Help Summit last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was there with me about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was 2016, in January.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably online someplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: He really summarized a lot of modern human
sexuality research around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's even some controlled research on
cannabis and blood flow and organs.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's psychological stuff and there's
physiologic stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole world of that that I know
very little about.
[SPEAKER_04]: His talk really put a lot of it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please look for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's really into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a huge untapped area when
we talk about this whole very modern
[SPEAKER_04]: distinction we have between what's
recreational and what's really medical and
[SPEAKER_04]: what's health.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tantric cannabis use, there's a really
good paper from 1970s by Dr. Michael
[SPEAKER_04]: Aldrich, Tantric Cannabis Use in the
Indian Journal of Psychoactive Drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the first one to really pull some
of these texts together.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of what was happening there was
various forms of violation of social
[SPEAKER_04]: mores.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people who did not eat meat,
that night they would eat some beef.
[SPEAKER_04]: People who did not use alcohol,
they would drink some hard alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis was also a little bit of a always
seen, though it was not illegal,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was some groups in certain times who
would use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were using it in an off time,
it's like, hey, you're doing something
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're not supposed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of that was that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, all the use of cannabis in those
social, religious contexts was oral.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is inhaled cannabis use as well in
groups there, but that's not what's
[SPEAKER_04]: described in Dr. Aldrich's book or paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that what's happening is that
you just get a longer duration effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a first pass through the
liver.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get this stronger 11 hydroxy
metabolite THC, as opposed to when you get
[SPEAKER_04]: inhaled, you get a much lower amount of
that that has more blood grade barrier
[SPEAKER_04]: penetrability.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a longer lasting effect,
and it's stronger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can go all night long.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just joking.
That's why we do it like that.
Take your time.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, who wants to talk that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a reading question for you,
Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've talked a lot about humans and the
history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hear a little bit for the room
about the history of women and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because obviously, there's a judging
history there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that you can speak about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a great, she's at University
of Southern Maine.
[SPEAKER_04]: She wrote that book on the WAM community
of women.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll blanken her name just right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wendy Chapkis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Wendy Chapkis was a sociologist who
had studied sex workers in the US and
[SPEAKER_04]: started writing about cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a really great book, you can check it
out, called Dying to Get High.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she has a really great chapter on the
gender issues around cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: that some of the notions around cannabis
as a female flower, and some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: emotional receptivity things that it does
generate in its users.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are part of why it's been aligned.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she kind of ties it into sexual,
you know, the feminist lens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was another person who's written
something else recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tremendous masculinity in the
modern high times portrayals that
[SPEAKER_04]: historically started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because high time to playboy joined,
started to get, you know, they were funded
[SPEAKER_04]: by the same people, catered to the same
crowd, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was out of that kind of aficionado,
you know, smoking your cigar in your,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, with the road that, you know,
these notions were popularized.
[SPEAKER_04]: As if it is a strictly masculine,
you know, thing, high time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's completely like modern,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking 19th centuries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you go further back, you know,
I mean, the historically in Europe,
[SPEAKER_04]: the witch hunts, which were, I don't know,
a hundred, a hundred thousand women were
[SPEAKER_04]: burned at the stake or buried through a
effort through the royals and the Catholic
[SPEAKER_04]: Church.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really eradicated traditional plant
healers.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these were women.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of them, you think, had cannabis
in their hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that it's part of,
you know, what we've lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: The use of cannabis in childbirth was also
something that we know had evidence from
[SPEAKER_04]: in the Levant, like modern
Israel-Palestine in actual physical
[SPEAKER_04]: evidence of people who are giving birth.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen in their bones and their
remains that they've died in childbirth,
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis residue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that the use in ways to help
labor, you know, these things have been
[SPEAKER_04]: completely marginalized as if that doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then not to mention, you mentioned you
talked about menopause and there's also,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, menstrual dysphoria-related
pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has, a lot of patients have said that
cannabis is helpful for them to have more,
[SPEAKER_04]: when they have severe symptoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in pregnancy, there's the nausea and
vomiting of pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Severe problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll get hospitalized for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have no good treatments for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we give very drugs that may be more
harmful to their conceptus than what they
[SPEAKER_04]: are taking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: When cannabis, we don't have strong
evidence that it's this very dangerous
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, but we know that it can help people
in that scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't even have that option
available.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's lots of things that we don't
think about that are specific to women's
[SPEAKER_04]: bodies around, and their traditional
knowledge that have been completely
[SPEAKER_04]: ignored as if that's sort of like a
marginal issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's way more histories there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I mean, they don't have that on
her.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, you did it.
You did it.
Thanks.
This is a much more boring question.
I can't even come close to that.
That was good.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about two distinct species,
indica and sativa, and then we kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: touched on mineralis a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any historic route of,
you know, anything to do with mineralis,
[SPEAKER_08]: or is that just kind of documented?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on Hilly's work, the genetic
analysis of various libraries,
[SPEAKER_04]: they didn't find a third proven.
[SPEAKER_09]: So mineralis is actually this?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a weenie version of one of the two,
or a mix of the both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is a semi-domesticated plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It never stays domesticated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is why it's a weenie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of these stands may have been
around for millennia.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are still, while in that area where
cannabis evolved, that was telling me
[SPEAKER_04]: about, you can still find wild-grown
cannabis in the forests and in the rivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it's came to the attention
of Western scientists by Soviet botanists
[SPEAKER_04]: in some time in the 30s or 40s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember when.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is who coined the term ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soviet biologists.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think people just didn't really
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had no idea for nomenclatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, they were just like physical traits
that they thought set it apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that there might not be,
there's definitely a geography of genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you really want to get into the
speciation, we don't find that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually we're going to change our,
the classification has been contested for
[SPEAKER_04]: so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the fact that we used and named it
cannabis and that we had sativa for,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, everything to do with where
Linnaeus, the botanist in Sweden,
[SPEAKER_04]: where he was at the time and what he knew
about cannabis, he had no knowledge of
[SPEAKER_04]: drug cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: So where does hemp be named?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, hemp is, the uses,
what we now call hemp, the uses of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis that involve fiber and cellulose,
cordage, and seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can produce that from either of those
two classes of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened in India, they started to
make charas and ganja, which are like more
[SPEAKER_04]: something that's, with charas you would
actually want, you'd run your body through
[SPEAKER_04]: the field and then scrape the resin off
your body.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, people step on grapes and wineries
all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people, oh, it's so romantic to
step on the grapes, but then we consume it
[SPEAKER_04]: or wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the same kind of thing,
except you're just, you know, they
[SPEAKER_04]: wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, people are laughing with delight,
Sam.
Oh, that's so, that's unheard of.
No, it's still done.
Right after the sex topic.
That's awesome.
Actually, they would often use children.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is documented.
[SPEAKER_04]: In order to do this, they needed shorter
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: In order to do a charas production,
you would select for varieties that
[SPEAKER_04]: wouldn't grow very tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you were making other materials,
paham, it was, you didn't need to do that
[SPEAKER_04]: charas lecture.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could grow taller.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is one way that some distinctions
that we kind of think about broadleaf and
[SPEAKER_04]: narrowleaf and size may have come out of
this genetic germplasm pool that was down
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when charas production moved into
Lebanon and the Middle East, people,
[SPEAKER_04]: they may not have used shorter plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They may have used longer plants because
they had different methods of making
[SPEAKER_04]: hashish through, you know, seeds and the
more outer things that we're more familiar
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of these, so I think, you know,
it's all to do with just different
[SPEAKER_04]: versions of the same, in the same family,
which species of varietals are more
[SPEAKER_04]: developed in the area of hemping that you
want, whether it's the stock or the seed
[SPEAKER_04]: predominantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I can tell you the
restrictions that we place on hemp today
[SPEAKER_04]: probably artificially limit the variety of
thick, stocked, high yielding,
[SPEAKER_04]: fiber, oil, seed, cellulose plants that
could be potentially grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you really can't, this whole idea that,
okay, we're only going to have,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, less than 0.3% for this means
that a whole potential genetic,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're chopping off the arm of cannabis
because maybe those varieties have genes
[SPEAKER_04]: and features that'll be more helpful to
have a greater yield if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: get cellulose.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that shouldn't be at all a barrier for
at least R&D when it comes to developing
[SPEAKER_04]: good, hardy hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you more or less answered,
I was trying to sort of get to the genetic
[SPEAKER_06]: origins of the drug type, non-drug type,
narrowly, broadly, but it sounds like the
[SPEAKER_06]: drug type was being forced upwards over
time and so had to respond through
[SPEAKER_06]: developing new cannabinoids and terpenoids
to protect itself, whereas the non-drug
[SPEAKER_06]: type was more having to compete in the,
I'm sorry, yeah, the non-drug type was
[SPEAKER_06]: having to compete in the lowland,
you know, in sort of more in a weedy
[SPEAKER_06]: environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the broadly narrowly sounds like
was something that was more cultivated by
[SPEAKER_06]: humans along the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so do we have really, can you break
them into almost four distinct groups of
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of base cannabinoids and terpenoids
and other, is that one way to kind of look
[SPEAKER_06]: at it is you've got, if you were to look
at sort of the whole plant extracts of
[SPEAKER_06]: non-drug type, drug type, broadly
narrowly, would you have four distinct
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of groupings?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mind your hat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I'll let Ethan and Rizzo
answer that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just say briefly, there are certain
terpenoids that are associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: so-called sativa and others with so-called
indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, this is sort of a false dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people are really hung up on these
names.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you need to know is what the
biochemical composition of whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you'll have an idea what it's good
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you call up one species or four
species, to me, is beside the point at
[SPEAKER_01]: this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on every side of this issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally a great discussion,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But, so, I understood about the
cannabinoids of different species,
[SPEAKER_03]: but what are your thoughts about origin of
photopears specific?
[SPEAKER_03]: Photo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Photo-period specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have like your auto-flowers and
then you have your traditional cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: species.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flowering at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about the daylight
flowering patterns?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just recently had my first experience
with growing some auto-flowers and there
[SPEAKER_03]: was kind of an aha moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought, well, perhaps this expression
of cannabis was more in areas where they
[SPEAKER_03]: had to capture a certain growing season
and had to happen fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought, well, maybe this genetic
expressed in the northern or deep southern
[SPEAKER_03]: hemispheres.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a total random thought,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: As opposed to where our traditional
cannabis could be generating from more of
[SPEAKER_03]: the tropic region where you would have the
seasonality would go on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your thought is what I think the thoughts
that people have.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this text, he talks about the flowering
pattern based on stresses of number of
[SPEAKER_04]: days of darkness and days of lightness has
something to do with the latitude in which
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis is being evolved.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has everything to do with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that makes the most sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have different, probably there's other
plants that are more have different
[SPEAKER_04]: behaviors that are coming from the
northern latitudes where there's much
[SPEAKER_04]: darker periods in winter that are still
living.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is one, I think the most
domesticated plant on planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no other plant that grows in so
many different places.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is extremely adaptive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's gotta be a wizard to adapt to
different daylight cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant still has to do photosynthesis,
has to have dark reactions, has to do all
[SPEAKER_04]: that stuff to make it survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you're onto something,
but I have little more to offer than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're on the right track.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've talked about the breeding for
health and for recreational and medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did people start talking about the
different effects of different strains of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a 20th century thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the cannabis that was being
sold in pharmacies in the 20s and teens,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of it was herbal, some of it was
tinctures.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a variety of different effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: People would talk about comparisons
between this stuff made by Grimald was
[SPEAKER_04]: different from this stuff made by Park
Davis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think people understood much
about, we had no biochemical, genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: variation understanding, at least in
popular science literature.
[SPEAKER_04]: People actually used this thing called a
beam test to distinguish cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a bogus test.
[SPEAKER_04]: They thought this was testing for
cannabinol.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nobody really knew chemically.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what you're talking about would be
probably something that wouldn't have been
[SPEAKER_04]: written down maybe in the more folk
traditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would look more into that anthropologic
literature than anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the stuff that was sold in the
shops, the exposure of Americans to
[SPEAKER_04]: growing cannabis was very modern.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you talk about here, that's going to be
the post operation, whatever that Mexican
[SPEAKER_04]: operation that Nixon ran, his version of
modern Trump wall and whatnot here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what led to domestic cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the US, a huge explosion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's when people started taking
that up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether there was knowledge of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the idea of sensimi,
people think this is a modern thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: actually separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was again, South Asian cannabis
farmers were separating males from females
[SPEAKER_04]: hundreds of years ago to produce ganja.
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably had a lot of awareness of
these different varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I haven't read much about it.
I take your point that proliferation of
cannabis has been a populist issue
essentially.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's particularly important for
us now as we're being essentially sold a
[SPEAKER_10]: bill of goods of legalization.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet it seems like to me and some others
it's prohibition version 2.0.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there other nuggets from history that
you might be aware of?
[SPEAKER_10]: That we can take faith from and leverage
for a better effect than an extremely
reactive prohibition.
This book is crazy, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The relationship of cannabis to various
forms of imperialism throughout history is
[SPEAKER_04]: something worth seriously noting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say prohibition is really just
social control, model, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis production was all the rage for
running mercantile systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: To have your ships, your cordage.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was back-ridden.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard work to turn standard cannabis,
not pre-modern societies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really had to incentivize and you had
to have people who are willing to work for
[SPEAKER_04]: cheap and work hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was talking about the history.
[SPEAKER_04]: These things certainly we need to learn
our history so we don't repeat them.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of interesting things.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy talks about some of the ways in
which certain forms of transformation from
[SPEAKER_04]: slave systems to indentured servitude and
how cannabis, both abuse and forcing
[SPEAKER_04]: people to grow it, so there was a time we
had to force people to grow it,
[SPEAKER_04]: not for hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the dismantling of the American hemp
industry after the Civil War because
[SPEAKER_04]: Kentucky could no longer sell its raw
materials to places where slave labor
[SPEAKER_04]: would take over the rest of the
development process.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea that making money off the backs
of disempowered people and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: that goes way back in various forms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can learn a lot from
understanding how that was actually done
[SPEAKER_04]: by these different imperial powers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we know a lot more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe that education and knowledge,
we can't call it alien anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's different various ways that we're
trying to alienate cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently, the National Academy of Medicine
put out this report, big study in January,
[SPEAKER_04]: said, okay, I can conclusively say the
leading scientific group in America,
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis has effects in reliefs chronic
pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: No big surprise to anybody in this room,
but the most august scientific bodies said
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just this morning, the director of the
National Institute on Drug Abuse took
[SPEAKER_04]: issue with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back to these ridiculous back and
forths.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think that what I might view is
that cannabis is a traditional plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Traditional plants have protections under
all forms of international law.
[SPEAKER_04]: International law has also got its
problems with the UN and who gets to call
[SPEAKER_04]: the shots over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of smaller countries work hard
to get those traditional plant protections
[SPEAKER_04]: in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is something that we need to keep
saying over and over.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not an investigational new drug,
a modern thing, this is a traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that has any value or any weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to St. Pauline Falls,
there's a plaque there, it says
[SPEAKER_04]: traditional cultural property of the,
I forgot which tribe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the traditional cultural property.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a law under the American federal
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the first places that got
the recognition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is traditional cultural property.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a very fair way to talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you just follow up on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.
I'll give you a little bit of break.
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently in Washington, the only black
button law we have is Thurston County v.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kurtz.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the best law we have and that's
based in Good Samaritanism.
[SPEAKER_10]: What does that say?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not familiar with their ruling.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, Bill was growing to supply both
for himself and for other folks.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it involves both commercial
exchange for expenses as well as the fact
[SPEAKER_10]: that in a world in which there's no
appropriate product, you can be a Good
[SPEAKER_10]: Samaritan and provide.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what my lawyer tells me and I rely
on it every day, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like there's maybe even an older
case in law to be made.
[SPEAKER_10]: My question boiling down to do you think
we're in perhaps a more protected status
[SPEAKER_10]: here in Washington State as many of our
states move on to more prohibitive and
[SPEAKER_10]: narrow scope of access?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think maybe we enjoy some special?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking for a silver lining.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are special because we are
Washington-tonians and we have a governor
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to stand up to the presidents
in sessions with cannabis pushback and
[SPEAKER_04]: that's unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't hear all the governors and all
the legal states doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a Vashon Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's something to be said for
what you create.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm no attorney.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what things can be argued.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought law would be a great thing to go
into when I was younger, to fight for the
[SPEAKER_04]: rights of people, but you have to really
know what they'll listen to and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I believe that, I did write something
up with Catherine Pettis, who's an
[SPEAKER_04]: international association of hospice and
palliative care activist at the
[SPEAKER_04]: international level on this idea of the
international drug treaties.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going international,
similar kind of thing if you push it down,
[SPEAKER_04]: are a form of patent protections that gave
worship of these plants to governments.
And the government's friendly
pharmaceutical companies.
And that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you recognize that this plant is older
than the company's ever existences,
[SPEAKER_04]: then that can't stand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you going to argue that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the A or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe our courts would recognize more
of those things in other courts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there are always, you should talk
to a lawyer, but I would love to.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of folks also interested in
indigenous rights in this state.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got very active, very active tribal
presence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they like to, they follow whichever
federal law or their treaty law or their
[SPEAKER_04]: state law, depending on what they're
trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really, that's unique here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a very interesting system here
that is different from where I grew up in
[SPEAKER_04]: Oklahoma, that if tribes are told on day
one, that memo will never apply to you,
[SPEAKER_04]: so forget it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wouldn't happen here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a stronger tribal presence.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got to figure out something
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: A quick little sidebar.
[SPEAKER_07]: You talked to me about Bashan in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was CC'd on an email earlier this week
from Dr. Dominic Borla, who's here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was talking to somebody in Humboldt
County and CC'd me on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was describing Bashan.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he says, Bashan's like a liberated
zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, cannabis and people who think
it's just different.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to go there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a very high compliment.
We've got time for two more questions.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gene therapy is when you use a vector to
introduce new genetic material,
[SPEAKER_04]: usually a virus, to introduce new genetic
material into the subject, usually a human
[SPEAKER_04]: host that has a genetic disorder.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you try, usually they've used various
forms of polio or HIV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some forms of those viruses that are
really good to get into the cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis genome is a plant genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are remnants of, let's see,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I don't know of any genetic
overlap.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to tell you CB1 receptor gene,
which is one of the most widespread
[SPEAKER_04]: receptors in the brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a bit of that DNA in the spiral
gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the spiral heat that causes Lyme
disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, some of the spiral heat that
causes Lyme disease is DNA is in CB1.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some ancient overlap of that
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it was infecting us, its DNA got
transferred into the human CB1.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in some medical journal I found in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some interesting hypotheses
about the seasonality of schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_04]: People like to make all kinds of theories,
but there is something overlapped there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's crosstalk in nature between
pathogens and hosts, genetically speaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we consume cannabis, we aren't
getting its DNA into our system.
[SPEAKER_04]: But is it altering our way that our body
does gene expression?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how it's therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be in that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for something like, if you have a
genetic disorder, if you were to start
[SPEAKER_05]: gene therapy with a host, could you see
multi-generations later that that's gone?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is cannabis a potential for that?
[SPEAKER_05]: To start changing the way the genetic
structure of a person responds to things?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we know sometimes genetic mutations
start happening because of outside
[SPEAKER_05]: sources.
[SPEAKER_05]: So could cannabis reverse those effects?
[SPEAKER_05]: And do the opposite?
[SPEAKER_05]: So exhibit A, you have a host who has a
genetic disorder.
[SPEAKER_05]: You give it to them in kinds of treats.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a next generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You give the next generation a treatment,
and then those are not affected.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then by the third generation,
you don't find it affected, potentially.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk more in your time.
Last question, Azula.
This is super quick.
Have you had any personal contact with Dr.
Vandana Shiva?
No, I have not.
Please.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I take that back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did meet her in Seattle in 2006 in Kane
Hall.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was there with a talk with Satish
Kumar.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Vandana.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a seed-saving group in India.
[SPEAKER_04]: She started and has argued for the rights
of farmers to save seeds and share seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot more to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you meet her then.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you, Sudhakar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
