[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to try to do something
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally when we record an episode of
Shaping Fire, we just do it audio only.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our friend Leighton Morrison is here
today and we just recorded an episode with
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very true that there is one
aspect of how the layers of soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: the horizons of the earth, really could
use a visual graphic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Leighton had the great idea of why
don't we show you the graphic now and he
[SPEAKER_02]: will walk us through it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we encourage you, if you have not
listened to the podcast episode,
[SPEAKER_02]: go listen to the podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are here because you already
listened to the podcast episode,
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully this will give you a better
understanding of the information that we
[SPEAKER_02]: cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Leighton, thank you so much for joining
me both on the episode today, but then
[SPEAKER_02]: also now here in my living room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go ahead and insert the
graphic here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why don't you go ahead and explain the
important intricacies that maybe were more
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult without looking at the graphic
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the cannabis industry as a whole
has looked at solely the O horizon,
[SPEAKER_01]: the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The O horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The O stands for organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, everything has been focused
on getting a matrix or a system that will
[SPEAKER_01]: allow fast rooting and for nutrients to be
absorbed and obviously pulled up by the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that regard, it makes sense that
you use a pure organic matter like a peat
[SPEAKER_01]: moss or a cocoa core or any of these other
growing mediums.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the interesting thing is, is that that
works great with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as you go into a living soil
system or an organic regenerative type of
[SPEAKER_01]: farming system, it does not work because
the organic matter has a couple issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, it goes hydrophobic,
which means that it will not absorb water
[SPEAKER_01]: and it goes anaerobic on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a double negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why I try to explain to people
that if you're going to go regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: organic, you need to consider all the
horizons, just like the soil, just like
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother Nature guided in creating these
different layers that provide different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start with the O horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, in these diagrams,
you'll see it's very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very tiny layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can only be an inch, you know,
half an inch deep in a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the most productive and fertile soils
on the planet, which is, I love this
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think the most fertile soil is
on this planet?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would probably say the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rainforest, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The top soil, the O horizon is very small
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just maybe an inch or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's the prairies in the west
because you'll have the O horizon as deep
[SPEAKER_01]: as 20, 30 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into soil construction in the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for right now, I want you to think
about, okay, well, the O horizon is very
[SPEAKER_01]: deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I drain that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I prevent that from going
hydrophobic?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where those other layers,
what's called the A horizon and the B
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also have sometimes the E
horizon, which is the alluvial layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll generally happen in old drainage
areas, old river beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you're going to get a
concentration of an E layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically it's just the O horizon,
the A horizon, and the B horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The B horizon is going to tend to be more
mineral rich, which makes sense because
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants, you know, they send their tap
roots down and they're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: absorb those clay particles and the high
mineral concentrations that exist inside
[SPEAKER_01]: the clay through the stratosphere and
through the network of organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the A horizon in my mind is the most
important for cannabis growers because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to pull excess moisture out
of the O horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to prevent them from going
anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it literally acts like a wicking
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think of it as pulling the excess
moisture away from the plant, pulling it
[SPEAKER_01]: out of that O horizon, which is holding it
like a sponge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually going to help in
transpiration, which means providing
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen down into the soil roots for the
organisms and also pushing the CO2 out for
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're using vocabulary that we use to
describe the horizons of the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The skin of the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I think that you're making this
transition to talking about how we're
[SPEAKER_02]: layering our pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you suggesting that instead of us
taking our soil and just mixing it all
[SPEAKER_02]: together, you actually are going to lay
one layer down and lay another layer down
[SPEAKER_02]: and then lay another layer down again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called biomimicry, just copying
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I work with clients, generally
speaking, is I will have a few different
[SPEAKER_01]: horizons blended for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I'll use the E horizon or Luvia
layers for drainage underneath and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: use an A horizon and then an organic
matter, a deep organic map, an O horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically it's just three horizons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom horizon, generally speaking,
I'll just take rocks, three quarter inch
[SPEAKER_01]: rocks, one inch rocks, whatever,
and I'll blend in some coarse sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll pack the rocks down and then I'll
put a layer of sand over the top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I use the sand is it's similar
as a sand filter system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use it in aquatic ecosystems to
actually filter out the fine particulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, it's reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're protecting the soils from migrating
the fines out because we don't want those
[SPEAKER_01]: fines to come out of the soil every time
we water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we trap them on the sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the bottom, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on the sand layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the roots can still go down,
migrate or pull out the minerals and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients from those fines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're never going to get an anaerobic
layer, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have an anaerobic layer,
the roots go down to the anaerobic layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go down to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now the alcohol actually melts
the tip of the root and that plant cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: heal that root.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're never going to hit plant
potential if your roots are hitting
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobic zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's so critical,
this drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we have the A horizon,
which is again going to have a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: content of sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's protecting the O horizon from
losing its nutrients and its fines from
[SPEAKER_01]: migrating down and plugging up the whole
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why each one of these layers is
so critical and should be taken into
[SPEAKER_01]: consideration, especially if you're doing
pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what else is in this graphic that you
want to point out before we just wrap this
[SPEAKER_02]: up and send people off to the podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: What should they be seeing when they're
looking at the graphic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most important thing is for
them to wrap their mind around the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that this is layered and it's layered for
a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works and functions correctly and
effectively because it's layered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you dig a hole next in your
backyard, look for those layers and get
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And notice the color change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick up those soils and rub them in your
fingers and feel them and you'll see the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in color.
[SPEAKER_01]: The texture, a gentleman that I'm working
with on spent soils, which is a big issue
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's, you know, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I'm trying to be good about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have mountains of the spent soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, all right, let's start with the
basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's add a little bit of sand to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want you to put it in a cup,
drill some holes in the bottom and watch
[SPEAKER_01]: the water move through it and do the same
without adding the sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he started playing around with that and
he was like, oh my God, this is totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels gritty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's draining better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have, it doesn't get smelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, see this, you know,
just by adding that little bit of sand to
[SPEAKER_01]: that whole horizon or that spent soil,
you're getting it to function better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're considering building soils,
you got to think about the function of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get water to move through it
without turning anaerobic?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I prevent anaerobic layers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that happens naturally in
nature through these layerings,
[SPEAKER_01]: through using the layers to separate and
to hold and protect from too many fines
[SPEAKER_01]: migrating into the deeper lower levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the graphic that you've been seeing,
this is essentially what started this
[SPEAKER_02]: episode that Leighton and I are recording
because I saw this at the regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture conference that he and Joshua
Rutherford put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I saw it and he's suggesting that
this is how we should be building our
[SPEAKER_02]: pots, like my mind was blown, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm all like, you know,
oh, we take our soil, we mix the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: we put it in, and then we do some sort of
green mulch, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like pretty basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea that I actually should be
making, you know, three or five mixes and
[SPEAKER_02]: then pouring them in order.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a new way for us all to
grow as farmers so that we can be growing
[SPEAKER_02]: the most thriving quality plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if this is new for you, like it is for
me, I encourage you to go and check out
[SPEAKER_02]: the new podcast episode out today,
the same day I'm publishing this video
[SPEAKER_02]: with Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And listen to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a long, long form
explanation of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then also this video is here so that
everybody can check out this graphic that
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll be referring to a lot in the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can I just add one more thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it's important for you
to understand that this technique is for
[SPEAKER_01]: using it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, you're not replacing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just cutting the plant and you're
leaving the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a long-term functioning pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of this is because we're trying
to establish that mycorrhizae network,
[SPEAKER_01]: which takes 90 days to get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's about the time you're harvesting
your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this way you can harvest your plant,
you can save your pot, you can save the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizae, and the entire rhizosphere is
intact, ready to go for your next plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not dumping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a permanent constructed soil that
can be reused over and over and over again
[SPEAKER_01]: for your entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is best practices for no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming right, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
Good to see you, too.
Good to see you, too.
