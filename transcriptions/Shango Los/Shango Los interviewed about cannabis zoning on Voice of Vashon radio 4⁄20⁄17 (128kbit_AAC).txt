[SPEAKER_01]: Legalize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Peter Tosh, their famous song.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Voice of Vashon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Borderlines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a 420 show because it's 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have on the air with me, Mr. Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy day to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been a keynote in a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time I met you, Shango, your head was
in a beehive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then things happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went on this trajectory and it
found you, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not doing quite as much beekeeping
anymore, but spending most of my time
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling the country, doing business
consulting and teaching how to use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lili, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bringing it onto a much more micro
level, we have very relevant to today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very well timed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming in on very short notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, hey, you want to come talk with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the advantage of working from
home and working on the island,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want me, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that's on the table right
now on this little wee island of ours is a
[SPEAKER_01]: possible marijuana ban.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the county is hearing different
opinions right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shango, why don't we, would you hit some
finer points about what this is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the sake of clarity, since that's
why you have me here, let's address the
[SPEAKER_00]: word ban, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because on the Facebook pages,
people are saying, well, wait,
[SPEAKER_00]: did Varsa really ask for a ban or did they
just ask for restricted zoning?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the rub is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as of right now, and the reason
why there is no cannabis store on the
[SPEAKER_00]: island today is that the zoning is already
incredibly restricted on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cannabis store would have to be in a
commercially zoned location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also has to be a thousand feet
from any kind of licensed daycare or
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because we've got a small downtown
core, that's pretty much the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown core.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you look at the other parts of
the island, you know, a burden's not
[SPEAKER_00]: legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctrine store is too far south and
it's too far south to say in business and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's for sale, not for rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old portage stores in bad shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And has most likely reverted to
residential zoning because it's not used
[SPEAKER_00]: its commercial variance in so many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing really appropriate
near minglement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just means downtown core.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, in my role as the
founder of the cannabis trade organization
[SPEAKER_00]: on the island, Vimea, you know,
when everybody was hot to trot for getting
[SPEAKER_00]: their licenses and everything,
you know, I was approached by,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, five or six different groups
to help them find a location on the
[SPEAKER_00]: island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we dug out the King County parcel
viewer and talked to landowners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, worked out all the
numbers and realized that there's really
[SPEAKER_00]: only about four locations on the island
that could actually even have a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are already occupied by long
time bash on businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in essence, even if someone were to
have a license, there's not really a
[SPEAKER_00]: location today to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are left with scratching our
heads and going, how can we, how are we
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the challenge with the Varsa
proposal was that they want to,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to make it even more restrictive
so that there couldn't be a store here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the downtown area, if a location were to
arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and so that becomes a ban,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then that makes it zero,
zero possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, they certainly don't
call it a ban.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I've spoken with the,
um, the vice president of Varsa this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning, we had a nice hour long
conversation and that was not their
[SPEAKER_00]: intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they, they, they mostly just
want to, um, uh, you know, keep cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the hands of children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I support that and, and they feel
that, you know, you kind of have to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, close to zero tolerance so that we
don't set a poor example for children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that we have some difference of
opinion on, on tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because, you know, my role is as a
patient advocate and, and for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk to and work with patients on Vashon
who get relief every day from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: from their Parkinson's, or they're using
it to cure their cancer, or they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: it for their arthritis, or they use it
topically for eczema, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these different people,
they come to me and we talk and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend for them products in that they
can get over town at, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at Canna West Seattle, uh, which is a kind
of a, uh, an ally of ours, I'd guess I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, and send them on their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it is uniformly inconvenient for
them to go over town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the patients, you know,
they're being sick, it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these folks, they don't have
a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for them to get over town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be so much more convenient if
we had a location on the island where
[SPEAKER_00]: adults could get adult use cannabis for
their own enjoyment and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety relief and just to have a good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And patients could get patient centric
products that they can use to get relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and unfortunately, um, the,
the, the, the Varsa proposal, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, would, uh, take, it would disallow
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just completely gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do encourage listeners to check out
Varsa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Network.org forward slash zone to see
their position.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just in fairness and transparency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good idea to see what they're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main issues really, if you boil it
down, um, their position is that having
[SPEAKER_01]: retailers here in the commercial zone
would, would, uh, send a message of access
[SPEAKER_01]: and also, uh, community tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't want to set that precedent
for kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's really what it boils down to in
essence is just just access and tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've ever, I've always,
because I am a parent of, uh, now 18 and
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 year olds, but at the time coming up
through school, I was that parent who
[SPEAKER_01]: always got the community attitude survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would fill it out and with great
interest, I would be shirking that
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the findings?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see, I want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't always see them, which is really
annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I have for your blood, sweat and
tears and 10 pages, you know, into
[SPEAKER_01]: clicking on all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to know, I want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: How'd we roll?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is our island sentiment really?
[SPEAKER_01]: And even then there's still nuggets on the
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be really good to see the entire
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it certainly would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, one of the interesting
aspects about it is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when, when I was, um, speaking with them
this morning, I was pointing out that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if, if their goal is truly to
keep cannabis out of the hands of
[SPEAKER_00]: children, the best thing to do would be
actually to support a retail store on the
[SPEAKER_00]: island because there's no chance that kids
are going to go in and purchase cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: at a store because every single cannabis
store in the state is on pins and needles,
[SPEAKER_00]: just trying to keep their license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in fact, um, in the last study in
Washington showed that cannabis stores
[SPEAKER_00]: were 94% compliant last year and that's
10% better than liquor stores were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we saw when we had, uh,
Kevin Bergen's medical dispensary store on
[SPEAKER_00]: the island, the, the amount of gray market
growers drastically decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people like to be able to go to
one location where they can get their same
[SPEAKER_00]: strain of preference for, or their
medicine in a, in a repeatable fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody who's ever, you know,
gone to buy pot from somebody,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's a different strain every
time and you have to meet them on their
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, it's not as convenient
as a retail location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the, the, the studies that have
been done, um, in both Washington and
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado show very clearly that when you
create a retail store, um, youth access
[SPEAKER_00]: goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's supplants a good part of the
gray market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as an Islander, I mean, everybody
knows everybody and you see a kid kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: walk in, pass a shop, you're going to
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be like somebody on the
other side of the island is going to know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things get around here really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go tip toe and be stealth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no hiding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like that idea because I mean,
you're either out there and it's legal or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does take kind of that,
that gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Straight away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the interesting aspects of this
though, is that, um, while I thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: was important to, um, uh, to alert our
community to, um, Varsa's policy and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they were trying to influence the zoning
through the community plan, there really
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't, there never really was any
likelihood that the Varsa plan was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's important for people to
participate in their democracy and email,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Bradley Clark at, at King County
to, to, um, to voice their opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But King County was, is very clear that
they do not want to make a zoning cutout
[SPEAKER_00]: on Vashon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing that happened when
Edipure wanted to move into K2.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very clear that they didn't want
to change the zoning for Edipure to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it unlike everywhere else in the County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, except now it's on the flip is,
is, um, you know, our, our, our good
[SPEAKER_00]: friend, um, a councilman, Joe McDermott,
um, he was very clear like, listen,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not going to make a cutout for
Vashon Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just to make it more restrictive than
the rest of King County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, as we've been making the
community plan, no version of it had an
[SPEAKER_00]: increased restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, as a, uh, passionate,
um, patient advocate, I needed to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that, you know, we dotted the I's and
crossed the T's and people weighed in
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, a, a group of concerned
parents can do a lot of damage sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm that parent that had weed tests in
my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They totally work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I think is one of the best ways
that you can knit things in the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pun was not intended, but they slip out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a copywriter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I, I herald that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, even though some people
might think that giving your kids a UA is
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive, you are doing, um, responsible
parenting in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the, that kind of instruction
should come from the parent in the home
[SPEAKER_00]: and it should not be something that should
be a island wide regulatory, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot to be said for just
starting at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the thing, complete disclosure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has there been weed in my house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have a neurologist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief neurology at Swedish is the first
person that said, let's write this into
[SPEAKER_01]: your medical plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Galbifenten isn't working for you,
I have chronic myelitis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was looked at in 2009 for probable
MS and I still have lesions on my spinal
[SPEAKER_01]: cord and it causes a whole lot of chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live with it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but did I have weed in my house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I had some really honest
conversations with my children?
[SPEAKER_01]: Had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, and similarly, you know,
when I moved to the island, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the reason why I finally made
the jump, I had been coming here for years
[SPEAKER_00]: to visit and volunteer on the organic food
farms, but I finally made the jump after
[SPEAKER_00]: my brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a traumatic brain injury from a dual
concussion and my neurologist as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all like, I really think that medical
marijuana would be good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I looked into it and, um,
and you know, it helped me with my
[SPEAKER_00]: migraines and, and it helped me,
I don't know, reset my neural net.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things that a lot of
people don't understand about medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana is, um, you know, it is not a
bunch of people smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, certainly smoking is the
appropriate medicine for a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: no doubt, but the vast majority of them
are going to be looking for something to
[SPEAKER_00]: take orally, you know, like a,
like a tincture and sometimes an edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different ways that
you can take medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's not, you know, it's not
just for stoners anymore, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it didn't used to be either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the cannabis was 70% of the
pharmacopoeia before it was prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we, we had used it as a
society for thousands of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it became politically unpopular
and here we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's get really politically unpopular
and play a song by Black Uhuru,
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensemilia, and we'll be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Uhuru, stock of Sensemilia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on where you look on iTunes,
you'll see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensemilia, Sensemina, Sensemilia,
Sensemila.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take your pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a fun factoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to know what that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as important as it used to be,
but you know, in the, in the seventies and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, when cannabis was coming from the
tropic areas, um, they were growing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: these huge fields and they didn't separate
the boys from the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the girls would get pollinated and
they would start to grow seeds and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they would just harvest those and ship
them here to the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then it became the super premium
cannabis that they would go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they started showing sex,
they would pull out all the boys so that
[SPEAKER_00]: the females would not spend their plant
energy making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they started shipping seedless
marijuana to the United States and that
[SPEAKER_00]: blew everybody away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now as the U S has developed its own
industry, um, indoor during prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: and now outdoor as well, um, uh,
no seeds is kind of an assumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, that's the given.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seeds have to be sought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're hard to find good ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes a good seed is hard to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's go back to what we were
talking about a little while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the quote unquote marijuana ban on
Vashon Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, people have an opportunity to make
their voices heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is this evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this evening is our island's,
uh, yearly town hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the meeting is not specifically about,
uh, cannabis zoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, uh, councilman McDermott will
be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the sheriff will be there and,
uh, and various other, uh, King County
[SPEAKER_00]: folks, you know, and so, um, uh,
we Vashonites are invited to show up and
[SPEAKER_00]: sign up and we can speak on anything you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, if you want to talk about law
enforcement on that island or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or, or zoning or cannabis or the
homeless issue or whatever, you can show
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, uh, tonight at McMurray middle
school from six 30 to eight 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I know that a lot of folks in,
in favor of allowing cannabis on the
[SPEAKER_00]: island are showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, even, even if you're in
favor of the zoning, I just encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: people to show up and voice your
democratic rights, participate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, certainly since I'm an advocate for
cannabis, I hope more of our people show
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, but that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, also if, um, if you can't
make it to the meeting, you can also email
[SPEAKER_00]: Bradley Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you've got the email address
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Bradley.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's B R A D L E Y dot Clark C L A R K at
King County.gov.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brad's a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't feel like you have to like,
you know, get all vehement with him about
[SPEAKER_00]: a potential ban.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's objective and he's just collecting
our community's feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, to give to King County council before
they vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear about what you're up
to these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, I think you're specifically
talking about the Kickstarter because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I've been, I travel the country
now and I do, you know, keynote addresses
[SPEAKER_00]: at, at cannabis conventions and,
and, um, do consulting for new startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly I teach, um, medical care
providers, both, both licensed doctors and
[SPEAKER_00]: naturopaths how to use cannabis in the
clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But specifically this week on Monday,
um, I launched a media campaign,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, connected with a Kickstarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea behind it is that it's far
too common that visitors come into a home
[SPEAKER_00]: that have got a cannabis edibles in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe they're in the fridge,
maybe they're in a, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a pantry or something, but they're
unlabeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the babysitter or the grandma,
you know, looks at the treats and are
[SPEAKER_00]: like, those look like good treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to eat that brownie or that
bag of gummy bears or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, and so they go ahead and eat
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is until after the fact,
when they're uncomfortably medicated,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that, that they realize that they,
that they were, um, that they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's the, uh, I pulled together,
um, um, you know, nearly a hundred so far
[SPEAKER_00]: of the, um, uh, top cannabis companies in
the country, um, who wanted to support,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, labeling in the home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started this Kickstarter,
which is simply is just providing stickers
[SPEAKER_00]: to people to label their container that
they keep their edibles in, in their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of people say,
well, aren't there already warning
[SPEAKER_00]: stickers on the, on the cannabis packages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sure, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, people ignore them.
[SPEAKER_00]: People take the, take the edibles out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People make brownies at their own home.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is, is that we want to start a
new habit in the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make it a new assumption that
if you have cannabis edibles in your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have them in a container that is
labeled from the outside so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease, um, the likelihood that visitors
to our home, like babysitters will
[SPEAKER_00]: accidentally be medicated because it's
just no, nobody wins when somebody gets
[SPEAKER_00]: accidentally medicated, especially if they
get over medicated and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if somebody, if anybody wants to look
into it, you can check out that
[SPEAKER_00]: Kickstarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a, instead of giving you the
very long Kickstarter link, you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: go to my website at www dot shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's S H A P I N G F I R E dot com
forward slash Kickstarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will go ahead and, and,
and forward you to the page and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get, you can get, you know,
stickers for your home for as little as
[SPEAKER_00]: five bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, if you, if you are,
if you manage a, you know, a parent
[SPEAKER_00]: organization on the Island, there are
larger packages for you in case you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to get them and have them available for
your members.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a way for the cannabis industry,
businesses, cannabis enthusiasts and
[SPEAKER_00]: patients to all work together to address
this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that is becoming more common because
simply there's more cannabis and more
[SPEAKER_00]: homes now than at any point since
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that we can,
um, we can decrease the likelihood of,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we are, I have a feeling you're going
to get support on both sides of the fence
[SPEAKER_01]: where this is concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously people who are cannabis
positive, they want to keep their grandmas
[SPEAKER_00]: and babysitters from accidentally getting
dosed, but, but also, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned parent types or folks that are
more concerned, um, about cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supporting it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but actually we, we just launched on
Monday and so we're only four days in,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're only, we're already 25% of the way
to our goal because the support's been
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great time to let you know that
the views and opinions expressed on this
[SPEAKER_01]: program are not necessarily those of the
board staff underwriters or donors of
[SPEAKER_01]: voice of Ashan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as an organization, VOV does not take
political positions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do support our show hosts like me and
their guests in expressing their views as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as they're not obscene or hate
mongering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll be avoiding the obscenities
and hate mongering today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, funny fact, I had quite a time
because I wanted to bring rap or 20 songs
[SPEAKER_01]: in as well as reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck finding a clean one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a lot of ease down the
playlist though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going, Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to move in to another song,
but before that, I want to let you know
[SPEAKER_01]: that voice of Ashan will record tonight's
town hall meeting and it will be on voice
[SPEAKER_01]: of Ashan television and on voice of Ashan
.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can't make it, please tune in
either to the TV component or the radio
[SPEAKER_01]: component and we got you covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move back into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greetings from Jah from Half Pint.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be back with Shingo one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half Pint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greetings I bring from Jah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could do pot-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so lame at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you are here in the studio with me,
Heidi and Shingo Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are talking about all kinds of
things related to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we started with Vashon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started a little bit into what Shingo
is doing, um, between educating the
[SPEAKER_01]: educators basically and, uh, and being a
keynote everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go look at his website and
under events, the man is prolific.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm going to actually freak out the
next time I say, Oh my God, he's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, luckily, I mean, I try to leave the
island as little as possible because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where I moved here is to get out of
the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I tend to travel to speak off the
island about twice a month or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to not do it more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, you add a Vimeo
meeting, like, actually, this is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should plug the upcoming Vimeo meeting
on, um, on May 18th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Thursday night at the Grange hall,
which is located in the North End Ferry
[SPEAKER_00]: Dock parking lot at 7 PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we are having a guest speaker up from
Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a great fellow by the
name of Ben Cassaday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the topic is all about terpenes and
cannabis aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a lot of people don't realize is,
you know, they know about THC and CBD as
[SPEAKER_00]: two components of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC being the part that makes you feel
high and CBD, the part that replenishes
[SPEAKER_00]: your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they don't realize that the smell
of the plant is actually incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: healing as well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Ben's going to be coming up and
speaking to, um, to everybody who shows up
[SPEAKER_00]: for free, um, about, um, how terpenes
affect your body, um, how to use terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: in your everyday life, even without
cannabis and to help people kind of choose
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes that they might want when
shopping for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to be a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask you a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the scoop these days on growing
your own marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so the, the, the overarching response
is that it is illegal to grow your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in Washington period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, um, you know, most of the other
States, um, they allow every resident to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow six plants, but here in Washington,
we did not, um, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, for you to be able to legally
grow at your home, you need to have a,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, an authorization from your medical
authorization from your doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you just have that
authorization, you're allowed to grow four
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you join the state's registry of
patients, that four plants jumps up to six
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a place at the bottom of
the authorization where you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: your doctor can write in that you can
actually have up to 15 plants if you show
[SPEAKER_00]: need for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but then you also have to be on the
registry and being on the registry means
[SPEAKER_00]: that, um, you know, they can come and
check out your grow at your home if they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to, which I don't know a lot of
people who want to give up that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the registry has not been very
successful with the state so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to repeat, it's four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a medical authorization that
goes to six, if you join the registry up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 15 with it written on your
authorization, but, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, the enforcement of individual
growing is so low that what we have found
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Island is that, you know,
the traditional, what people think of as
[SPEAKER_00]: black market growers that were so
prevalent on bash on in the eighties and
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have just decreased and
decreased because first the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: industry was there and there were,
um, there were shops to go to,
[SPEAKER_00]: which decreased the number of,
of black market growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that has also happened with
recreational, um, to a certain degree,
[SPEAKER_00]: the prices are still relatively high and
recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, there still is a price
competition there, but, um, but the rise
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing has been just individual
people, you know, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professors, um, you know, uh, uh,
parents in a family where either they or
[SPEAKER_00]: their children have got a medical need,
um, folks who just like to get high and
[SPEAKER_00]: they believe that they should have the
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, people get their hands on
seeds and clones, you know, one way or
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just, you know, they grow a
handful of plants on their back porch just
[SPEAKER_00]: for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually has become the highest,
um, uh, growing, if you will, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: segment of the growing population on the
Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot less growing for business
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and a lot more people just growing at
just like they do their tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a DIY MJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's so for four plants in
the Pacific Northwest, any idea what that
[SPEAKER_01]: means in terms of actual usable marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the short answer I would say is no,
because there's so much variability in the
[SPEAKER_00]: yield of the plant based on the strain and
how well you tend to the kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can, you can, you know,
you can have a plant that does poorly and
[SPEAKER_00]: you get an ounce or less over off of it,
but that, you know, you could also grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge plant and get four ounces off it and,
and, and feel like a real winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, loosely, when people push
me, I say, you know, if you do your job,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you know, pencil out for two
ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and when you do better than that,
you can pat yourself on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, most people, they just,
they grow it because you know what they
[SPEAKER_00]: say, they say, um, cannabis is the gateway
to horticulture because people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: never really kept a garden before,
once they get into relationship with a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant and they, and they have
that connection with nature and they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got their hands in the soil and
the, the, um, I don't know if it's called
[SPEAKER_00]: husbandry for plants, but the,
but, but the taking care of another life
[SPEAKER_00]: form is very intimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you do that, um, suddenly you
have a, you've changed your relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, I see that, you know,
catch on all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if that works, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's certainly, it's certainly
anti-anxiety to grow a plant, just the,
[SPEAKER_00]: just the growing it itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're done, you can either,
you know, make medicine out of it or a
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture or edibles or just toke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way or another, it's, it's
probably increasing your quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are actually studies, not about
growing marijuana, but just having your
[SPEAKER_01]: hands in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very cathartic and same with being
walking in the forest and taking a jump
[SPEAKER_01]: into Puget Sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of forest baths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shankalos, thank you so much for coming
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep the music going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any parting words?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would say, um, uh, you know,
voice your opinion, get involved with our
[SPEAKER_00]: local politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, come on out tonight if you can email
Bradley Clark, if you can't, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just remember that even if people are
holding an opinion that is different than
[SPEAKER_00]: yours, we're all neighbors and treat each
other with respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Shingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: On to the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: My voice of Ashan.
O-R-T.
