[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Lowerman, known to most of us as
Farmer Tom, is an organic farmer,
[SPEAKER_01]: social activist, surfer, and a leader in
cannabis normalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1999, his legal collective,
Medical Marijuana Garden, was raided,
[SPEAKER_01]: which set him on a path of speaking out
and speaking up for cannabis patients
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer Tom first got my attention as a
legit organic food farmer, growing beets,
[SPEAKER_01]: broccoli, cucumbers, chard, tomatoes,
onions, among other food crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: and bringing them to the Clark County Fair
in 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: His food crops won 17 Blue Ribbons and a
Judge's Choice Award.
[SPEAKER_01]: I soon heard about his CSA for cannabis,
and it blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for those of you who weren't
here in the early days of Vimeo,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why Vimeo was started, was to
promote cannabis on the island as a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: save our organic family farms on the
island.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea at that point, before we saw the
regulations, was that we wanted to support
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers in adding cannabis to their crops
to take some of the pricing pressure off
[SPEAKER_01]: of the food, to just let be food and less
of a commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard about Tom's CSA, and I'm like,
damn, he's doing the ideal of why,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole reason I started my
organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, over time, we know that
that's not allowed anymore in Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a drag, but for a while,
he was living the dream of what I started
[SPEAKER_01]: Vimeo for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom has since diversified his interests,
co-branding a craft beer with Heathen
[SPEAKER_01]: Brewing in Vancouver, Washington,
called Farmer Tom's Super Dang IPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you who care about such
things, it's got an ABV of 9.3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that note, we give Tom extra credit
for driving the three hours up here from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Portland Vancouver border to speak
with us tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finally, the Federal Centers for
Disease Control has been to his farm to
[SPEAKER_01]: study cannabis best practices and has
asked for his help in writing a safety
[SPEAKER_01]: manual for the medical cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also looks like Canna Santa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost everything that I think is cool and
important, Tom has done before me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please welcome Tom Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all chicken skinned up here.
Thank you so much.
I want you guys to see all so many
familiar faces out here.
So many people that I've known and worked
with over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting to have everybody here,
and it's an honor to be on this stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of my idols have been up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of blew my mind when he asked
me to be up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is pretty much an honor,
a huge honor for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for showing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a little bit about me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born and raised in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just go right into my
agriculture stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started landscaping at age 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: My neighbor had a landscape construction
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started planting plants and ground
cover at a really young age.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that kind of got me into
agriculture and growing plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables and cannabis and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an organic sustainable farm down
in Vancouver where we grow our vegetables
[SPEAKER_02]: and our cannabis the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're big foliar feeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're big in the living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use lots of microbes and we feed the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a pretty simple process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to kind of take it up
from when I kind of started thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like at the end of July.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I want to keep my plants growing
every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I do is I go in every day to each
plant and I take four big leaves off the
[SPEAKER_02]: main stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to shock it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to keep it growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is for the small grower who's got
time to love and nurture their plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pretty much the way that I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never read any books about,
you know, growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm really not that,
you know, school worthy of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just been doing it a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of ram with what I do in a
landscape for my whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm always kind of ragged about my
holes because one of my big pins usually
[SPEAKER_02]: cost me about 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's with nutrients and compost and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always been a pretty thrifty guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in agriculture, that's what you kind
of got to do the best you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I like to do in July is I start to
like get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either one bigger branch on the inside or
two or four leaves or two like stems on
[SPEAKER_02]: the inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go through all the plants every day
and I try to just take a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit, a little bit off so they
keep growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that does is it opens up the
inside of the plant so we can breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, being on the west side of the
cascades, we get a lot of moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get a lot of humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all gets caught up in those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where most of the powdery mildew
starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the opposite side, like on the,
you get a powdery mildew on like the north
[SPEAKER_02]: side a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The northeast side especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really prevalent.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of where it starts and it
grows from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's the shadiest part of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to clean out all of that,
that dark side, that north side.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to clean that out a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also promotes ventilation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we live, we're pretty blessed with,
we have really nice wind where we live.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we live off the Columbia River.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every day at like three o'clock,
we get these nice breezes and they blow
[SPEAKER_02]: through until about ten o'clock at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always keep those sides of the
greenhouse open.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes for a nice ventilation and it
keeps the plants nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to plant right into the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a good energy spirit when
the plants do a little bit better if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're actually in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually heard of people that grow in
pots but actually ground their plants off,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some, you know, we're big on
feeding the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're really huge on microbes and
minerals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remidlerizing the soil, we use SEA 90,
which is a seed product out of Baja.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes out of Scammon's Lagoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twice a year they have a salt plant down
there and it floods over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once they take the salt out,
it's just a mineral base.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been using this for three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is a lot of life and it really
brings minerals back into the finished
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we always thought in agriculture,
that was always the missing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use a lot of rock dust and seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rock dust we use is Gaia's green
and it's out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason we use that one is because
it has the lowest salt content.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the rock dust out there have
pretty high salt content and this one has
[SPEAKER_02]: the lowest by far.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we get into this time of the year,
it's a race, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weather's come and we've got rain
already and the moisture's up and we
[SPEAKER_02]: already, our buds already got wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure people are starting to see bed
rot and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's key right now to start harvesting
as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what I'm usually looking for
when to first start harvesting is we try
[SPEAKER_02]: to wait as long as we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this industry, we've been doing it a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole deal was if you didn't have a
little powdery or a little white,
[SPEAKER_02]: you didn't wait long enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of haired out and went,
shh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which sometimes isn't a bad idea because
that stuff can really spread quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have much time and you
work in a regular job, you got to get it
[SPEAKER_02]: while you get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first sign, take it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially this time of year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to cut it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just wasting your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just whack that thing, get it out of
there, hang it up to dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we'll get into a little bit about
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's do a little bit about cleaning
out still.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do is right about now we've got
our leg showing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to leave it... So the plant's
about four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to have about this much breathing
room at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of skin everything up pretty well
until there's like a good crown here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got like four sets of stems
coming out of the main stock, the main
[SPEAKER_02]: cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that from the bottom down needs to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially this time of year, if you have
extra time, you really need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: stripping your plants down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's going to get moldy and it's
going to get wet and you got to keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: under cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really need to keep all your stuff
under greenhouses or under some type of
[SPEAKER_02]: tarp with fans on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really key, especially this time of
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not having the Indian summer that we
had last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really feel sorry for all the growers
who moved into the state and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh 2015, this is the way Washington is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sorry to say, this is the way
Washington is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got early freezes here down in
Vancouver as early as the first week in
[SPEAKER_02]: September before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it started at the second and third
week and rained all the way through
[SPEAKER_02]: December.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the way the weather is down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants will finish as best they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the weather gets cooler and damper,
they're going to try like heck to make
[SPEAKER_02]: seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll finish as much as they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And take them as long as you can until you
start seeing any kind of white or any kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't say it enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you see one spot, you've got to
cut that thing down instantly or you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to lose all that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just think you put all that effort in all
the way from May all the way through
[SPEAKER_02]: October.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't act on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what agriculture is all about is to
really be a farmer, you need to be on your
[SPEAKER_02]: property all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to be able to live with the
seasons and the changes and the way
[SPEAKER_02]: everything goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the drop of a dime in any
agricultural business, you got to change
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're doing, flip to another mode,
do it until it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've grown up to 90 plants
before on our farm and our two
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a race.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this year they've cut us way
down and I'm just growing four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this year has really been more
relaxation and joy before me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've really been able to get in there and
grow some exceptionally beautiful cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: this year because I've been able to spend
so much time and energy and love.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once the thing goes, we'd like to keep
them in as big a piece as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, four big branches coming
out from the main stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we try to lob them off in big chunks
and then we hang them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first thing we do is we do a
couple of processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: First thing we do is we want to get it in
the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want it getting dark and we want it
hanging up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing we do, big leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we go around and we'll sit there and
we'll big leaf all the big leaves off the
[SPEAKER_02]: main stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that's touching the main stock,
any leaf that's coming out, there's coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we bring it in the house and then
within the next three days, we start to
[SPEAKER_02]: prepare for, what we do is with all those
leaves, like we harvested Obama.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Obama Kush the other day,
last night actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, even on the big families,
the trichomes were all the way at the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom side of the families.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did is we collected all those,
we put them in brown paper bags and we put
[SPEAKER_02]: them in the freezer right away because
we're going to make an ice hash out of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we make ice hash out of everything,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when medical changed up here,
they kind of pushed us into rosin because
[SPEAKER_02]: we couldn't blow BHO anymore because it
was regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what we pushed for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of fought to have the concentrates
legal in the state because the kids were
[SPEAKER_02]: blowing themselves up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we pushed the legislature into
it so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now being medical and not being
regulated, I think they kicked the game
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really prefer rosin over a lot of the
BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way more flavorful, way more better
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny, we've been taking pounds,
making ice hash, turning it into a chunk
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they end up like six grams of rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody goes, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the best of the best,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can take my six ounces right away,
right off the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can put it in there, I can turn it into
hash, and I can have rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you haven't known 50-52,
John Novak told me this the other weekend,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no limit on the concentrates for
medical out there in the new law.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no limit for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my theory is, well, it's all the
language, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd pay damn good money for that
language out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They paid a lot of money so all of us
wouldn't be able to grow cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of money passed hands so all of us
would be out of the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see S as the big threat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Oregon as more of a threat than us,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: All the weed they're growing down there,
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went down to Durham Road about three
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two-mile dirt road, every Christian,
redneck, senior citizen, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only did they have three plants,
most of them had ten plants and all in
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred-gallon pots, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're worried about the black market,
they're going to be able to, the black
[SPEAKER_02]: market for Washington is what they should
be worried about, them being able to go
[SPEAKER_02]: into the rec stores in Oregon and
purchasing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the price difference is so
dramatic down there, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot less, you can get 20 grams of
really good oil all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's really cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I digress back into, so we keep the
big shade leaves, put them in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to run them in a couple days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next process, we like to take
everything that's attached to a stem off,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the little leaves, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within the first three days,
we go through and we cut off all of those
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves that are attached to the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we cut them off in about 18-inch
colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our colas are about this big.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll cut them off into 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll keep that as bud and hang that up as
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rest of it will be stripped off
the stalks and fresh frozen for more ice
[SPEAKER_02]: ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we only want to keep the colas for
smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rest of it is sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's way better than drying it out,
believe me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flip, flip, flip into a brown paper bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put some masking tape on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how easy is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of drying it and all these
different things, but then to make ash out
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it as efficiently as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of different ways to do
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just the way I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we take all of those buds out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep the big buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we'll do is we'll leave them out
there until the stem snaps pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the stems off the colon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what we'll do from there is we'll
buck them down a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to use brown paper bags,
grocery bags, for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a really great part of the curing
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're a really great part of keeping
your canvas.
[SPEAKER_02]: In years before, we had a lot of canvas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually stored a lot of our buds
in brown paper bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing how long the brown paper kind
of regulates the moisture inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually keeps them in pretty good
shape, surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, if you have a lot and you have
a lot to process, that's one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then pull it out every week or so and make
sure it breathes a little bit and wrap it
[SPEAKER_02]: back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not a bad way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends how much time you got to
put into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after we put it in the brown paper bag,
we cure it up so that the main stalk snaps
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that point on, we either put them
into buddy bags, which are like a turkey
[SPEAKER_02]: bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we actually use cellophane bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've used them on the farm for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife likes the cellophane, so I don't
argue with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it worked pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use big cellophane bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wood product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we keep them in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll burp them in there and leave the
bag open so it'll air out like every three
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: To start off, when you're doing the
burping process, whether you go into jars
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever, the jar process actually is
the best process.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have the time and you have the jars
and you've got the patience to do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: then the jar technique is probably the
best technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after it comes out of the brown paper
bag, we'll back it down a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put it into jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to try to pack the jars as
much as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to leave a lot of air in
the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you have air in there, the oxidation
process starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to have a little air in any of
the stuff you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you also want to be able to take it
out and move it around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a juggling act.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the curing process goes,
we'll jar it all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll burp every day for a day or
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll burp every two days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll burp every four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll just keep going out until we
like to do a 16-day cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the best cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out there, when we did the markets all the
time, that was kind of the gold standard
[SPEAKER_02]: for curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You seemed to be able to get it dry enough
and get it tasting good enough and get it
[SPEAKER_02]: ready to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it still holds all its flavor and
taste and aromas and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the time period that we look for
the cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been given some of those big tins
that do the curing in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't tried them yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to try them this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody gave a couple to me at the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'll give them a try.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really like to make sure,
whenever I'm packing anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's a little air in there if
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because with air, you're going to get
oxidation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and another thing, we like to keep all
of our stuff in a cool, dark room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a special room in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually inside one of our sauna.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we keep it all in this wood sauna that
we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we pack it all in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of where we kept it over
the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the middle of the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cropped last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my stuff is still tasting pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, it's kind of on the
downslide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now this crop is coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're getting fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what we do is we take the stuff
we didn't do from last year, we'll throw
[SPEAKER_02]: it in the freezer, and make ice hash and
bubble hash on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been big proponents of live resin
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were actually, a couple months ago,
when we were cleaning up before 50-52
[SPEAKER_02]: kicked into place, Paul was saying,
yeah, there's still some bags from 2013 in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm all, well, it'll be dipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, Dwayne, let's put that through
the machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we packed it all up in the machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got fire out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But freezing those turpenes, to get the
best flavors and tastes, you've got to
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh freeze that stuff as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because every hour, those turpenes are
disappearing, and disappearing,
[SPEAKER_02]: and disappearing, and disappearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to have the most flavorful
oils, passes, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh frozen is always the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really like the process over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious, what kind of concentrates can
you or can you not do with fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any that you can't do with fresh
frozen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not too sure about CO2, because I've
never really, I'm not a big fan for all
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2, but I've never really dabbled in it
that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more of ice hash than a BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And BHO really works really well,
because you're capturing all those
[SPEAKER_02]: turpenes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're in a frozen state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, when we were blowing BHO,
either through the closed loop or
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, we froze everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We freeze the BHO, we freeze the weed,
we freeze the steel columns with the weed
[SPEAKER_02]: inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everything was as ice cold as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were making concentrates,
we always thought the best place to do
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates would be like a super air
conditioned, like a paint booth setup for
[SPEAKER_02]: these paint guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because all the air comes out the bottom,
and they're sucking the air out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always thought that would be a really
super safe place to do it, and a really
[SPEAKER_02]: great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the colder you can get it,
and the drier you can get it, the better
[SPEAKER_02]: product you can do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you recommend that also for tinctures
on apples?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're just ripping, all you're
doing is ripping the tritons off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing, Tom, is that when you
do tinctures, freeze the alcohol,
[SPEAKER_06]: freeze the Everclear, freeze the cannabis,
because you freeze the water crystals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And nothing you want is water soluble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything you want is alcohol soluble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alcohol doesn't freeze.
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely help.
[SPEAKER_06]: At 165 a pound, it's Fred Meyer by Dry
Ice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And freeze the cannabis in a styrofoam
cooler for an hour with the Everclear.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you get a much different product.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be golden, because you won't get the
chlorophyll coming out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you do shake it, it can be 30
seconds to three minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: With frozen Everclear, when it goes golden
to green, stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I'm a big freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, big freezer is always big.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I become outright.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the turpines came out, we really
started digging in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was probably like three or four
years ago at the markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, turpines were the big
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how could we capture them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how could we get the tastiest oil?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do we need to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what were all the tricks?
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody had their trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way they bathed it out was like
conductive, non-conductive, conductive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-conductive, all these layers of glass
and metal all filled with water to get
[SPEAKER_02]: that perfect temperature so you can
capture those perfect turpines all in the
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it got all geeky there for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had some fire oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now all they did was make us step our
game up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really love the whole rosin and ice
hash deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's tons of weed out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's going to be the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at $0.37 a gram to $1.50 or
whatever it is, and then everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: saying it's going to go down like an
organ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what they're expecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But organs are going to be a mess,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much marijuana down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as your eye can see, many places,
huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have no plant count down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to walk out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, it's going to be good for the
customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can keep the quality up,
that's the whole deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they going to do to save their
crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So knowing your farmer and knowing where
your product comes from is a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we all here, we love to
grow our own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we always believe, Paul and I,
that when we were doing our collective
[SPEAKER_02]: garden, we always had pieces of something
special for every one of our patients in
[SPEAKER_02]: our garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we believe that their energy
needed to be in the greenhouses with the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we thought that the plants are so
intuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow my own best weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in here grows the best weed for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant's intuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really has an idea of what you need and
what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe everybody does grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best plants for themselves,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: The ice hash process?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do is we fresh freeze
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put it in brown paper bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the brown paper bags, even in the
freezer, seems to pull a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do is we'll take that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use a washing machine and bubble
bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a work bag that's a zipper bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like the delicate laundry bag
for the satins and all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's about as big as this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we do is we like to layer it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put ice on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll, like if we're working with
whatever product we're, buds or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll put a layer of those in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll just layer it all the way to the
top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have this big, huge zipped block.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this dry ice?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is regular ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what we do is we take it and we
put it in the washing machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we run it at 15 minute cycles,
two cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we dump it into a set of bubble
bags, which are like different meshes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it goes from about 160 to 72 to 40 to
20 to 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 25 is your full melt ice hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it can be dabbed and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the 40 is like your money bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you're going to get all your
good trichomes and your turpenes are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to hang out there.
And then the rest of the stuff is kind of,
you know, it's questionable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two bags we like to work
with, those two bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what we'll do is we'll run it
through the bags and I'll run them four
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll keep that bag in there until all
the ice is melted out of that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just cannabis in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what you can do with that
byproduct is it's all fully usable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take that product and put it out in
like a dryer, like a dehydrator,
[SPEAKER_02]: and layer it up and dry it out and then
powderize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got cannabis already ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try to use as many of these products
as possible, you know, as we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back to the hash deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we got them in our bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lift them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we put them over a five-gallon
bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we get a little water squirt
bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We start to squirt all the bubbles out so
you end up with just the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we take it and we wring it out
really good and squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to get as much of the water out as
we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes into our freezer where we
have all these little packets of chunks of
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what we do is we microplane it,
zesting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll take pizza trays and add like a
lemon zester.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got this big block of hash
that's frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll go like this and just powder it
out all over the pizza tray, the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: pizza tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll put it in the cool dark
room, you know, and let it dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes about a week to dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what we'll do is we'll scrape all
of that stuff up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll put it into little 25
micron bags, silk bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll put it, then we'll squish
it with heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a little, somebody gave me some
little, you know, little squisher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we just squish it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what I like, I just love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take a pound and then we end up with
like an ounce or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we take it back and we end up
with like six or seven grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically we take a pound of wheat and
we end up with six or seven grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of our favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a novelty thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Tom, I know that you only keep the top
18 inches of the cola for yourself to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke, you know, in joints or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: For folks in the room who are not going to
make hash out of it, will you go through
[SPEAKER_01]: your drying process a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, last year when we had a
similar talk, it was more commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: oriented.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very focused on mandatory humidity
settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like most of us are just doing it in
our house, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's a like real DIY curing?
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do is we bring up, we have one of
those big humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bring it into the living room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of everything that's done in our
living room or our little storage shed out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we bring it in and we hang everything
and we have a little rotating fan that
[SPEAKER_02]: keeps everything moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we do, we cure it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, like I said,
we'll hang it up there until it snaps,
[SPEAKER_02]: until it's dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll buck it down and put it in
the jars and start working it for the 17
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of key.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the buds that are up there,
you can trim off as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of partial to North Cal,
North Pacific Northwest rough cut,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like the leaves a little bit on
it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really bother me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not like, you know, like those
Southern Oregon guys and those Humboldt
[SPEAKER_02]: guys and you know, everything has to be
like, you know, and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really doesn't do a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, we'll smoke their joints and
we'll smoke mine joints and people,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, we really like your leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I don't know.
So I think there's a lot of love that goes
into it.
It comes out with the end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering about your foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, do you do it pre-flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're heavy foliar feeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I use fish and I use compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother Earth Organics makes liquid
feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a humic acid base and it's pretty
much an activator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to use it with all my different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But three times a week, I spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays at three o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hottest part of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just go in there and we buy an
actual one that hooked onto my little
[SPEAKER_02]: mower, little pump sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just go in there and up underneath the
leaves, the whole inside, just get them
[SPEAKER_02]: drenched and watch them just blow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that hydrolyzed fish?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just that, I don't know,
we buy it at the Fred Meyer, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: down the street, you know, the fish
emulsion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the fish emulsion, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just do the stuff you've been doing for
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try not to get too high tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to, you know, the kiss method is
pretty much, you know, let's keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: simple, all this crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't see a lot of super
benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those microbes that you see on the
table here, those things are bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big, huge micro fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we micro this heck out of
everything and then we molasses a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start molasses and we'll molasses,
you know, we stopped molassing about two
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks ago, but we molasses heavy,
heavy, heavy, heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's microbes and molasses and then
it's, you know, we rotate the back one and
[SPEAKER_02]: the seed one, those, you know,
right up to the end, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: it could be, I think Worm Tea could work
pretty good too, you know, and then these,
[SPEAKER_02]: you wouldn't want to make it too nitrogen
rich, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the fastest way to get the,
you know, the nitrogen to the leaves is
[SPEAKER_02]: like right up under it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the heat of the day, you know,
all the stainless or everything is wide
open, man.
They just drink.
No, I just go up underneath because that's
where they feed from.
They don't feed it from the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, all the plants feed from the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we, from tomatoes to everything,
we always, we always go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, we just use fish and tea,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't, we don't, I don't like to put
sugars on my leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the sugars go on the soil where
the microbes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the microbes, you know,
they, they start doing what beer does,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and they start, you know,
burping and all that fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it makes all that stuff
more bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you recommend you do a flush at the end
to flush out the nutrients and everything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, outdoors is a little bit
different than in pots and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my pot, my bowls are like,
you know, this big, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just, we'll just stop at the,
we'll just stop like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We stopped like two weeks ago and maybe
I'll do one big watering at the end,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the end, at this time of year,
you want to cut back on your watering
[SPEAKER_02]: because you really want to force them to
finish as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this year is super short,
so you want to force them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do is we'll quit watering them,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll finish up quicker,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then especially since in the ground up
we have a lot of rain, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll start getting groundwater in there
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and we end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to force them at the end and
push them a little bit to finish quicker
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's always a road race out here
for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we never really get to ideally
finish, but they do a really good job
[SPEAKER_02]: here, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they do a good enough job because
of the fluctuations in the weather and the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also think that's why outdoor and
greenhouse cannabis, it tastes so good and
[SPEAKER_02]: it works so good because it's out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's out here in the nature, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets all of those wing changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a sterile on and off and on and
off, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day is a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got clouds in the morning,
some days it's sunny, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so there's a big variance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the plants are the plants
where we respond to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all about full spectrum everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full spectrum soil, full spectrum sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really like to isolate those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure you can get really pretty
beds, but you know, how do they look,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do they feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Allison?
[SPEAKER_03]: 16 day cure that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that, do you start like basically from
the time you take the plant down or after
[SPEAKER_03]: it's snapped?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, after it's snapped, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's after it's totally dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: 16 days after that, it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's off the, what do you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you mean take it off the stem and put
it in jars or is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we like them off or shuck them or
whatever off the stems and put it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: jars at that point.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you started harvesting anything yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all day yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I played golf, a Canada's golf tournament
on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got home yesterday and I got up
yesterday morning and I saw that one leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: go like this on my beautiful Obama Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, honey, get ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here comes the flood.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So she gets everything ready and what we
do is we set up our whole living room.
[SPEAKER_02]: She categorizes everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put everything on hangers.
[SPEAKER_02]: She puts a little piece of the tape on
where she marks everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We mark the day that we pulled it and we
mark the strain that it's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's how we kind of keep track
of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those blue, that blue tape goes onto the
brown paper bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also like to write everything on
the bags and we can keep track of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you start harvesting, you just cut
the branches off your plants and hang them
[SPEAKER_02]: upside down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do a lot of topping and they're
small, so I got like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: four big crowns coming off each one and
I'll like take those off and then hang
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife does, I mean, that's all she does.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, hers is amnesia hazel.
[SPEAKER_02]: All she likes me to do is go to Home Depot
and get the big, huge leaf bags,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then she just takes the
whole thing and she likes dust it in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and all she does is break it off
throughout the year and it is phew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, still to this day, I'm like,
can I have some of your amnesia hazel?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Farmer Tom, got that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, over the years, you've expanded your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had a lot of different types of
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've tried a lot of different methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the reduced number, what is your
preferred method for the most amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest per plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most amount of harvest per plant by
preferred method?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just big, huge holes because the
bigger the hole, the bigger the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we go jumbo holes and when you're using
a clone, all those roots are going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: laterally out to the edge of pretty much
where your canopy is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to make sure, I'm not a big
fan of super deep soil and the wasting a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, I take the shuttle,
about eight, 10 inches in, pop it out,
[SPEAKER_02]: we clean it out and that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't dig big, huge pits and I don't use
three feet of soil and I don't do anything
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, we've always gone kind of minimal
and our plants always look pretty good
[SPEAKER_02]: from what everybody says.
Yes.
So, do you have anything more specific
about how to tell a plant to start
harvesting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Up here, there's a couple different,
whoops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So up here, I got the white lines here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up here, it's a race.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you have powdery and once you have
light, then it's time to pull them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have either of those,
I would just wait until your covas are
[SPEAKER_02]: nice and buttered.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're indicas, they're going to,
if you want to take the microscope out and
[SPEAKER_02]: look at them, like if 50% of the trichomes
are amber, that's like ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or lighter is a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lighter they are, the more up high it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more clear they are, the more up high
it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it all depends kind of what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: The deeper the amber, so you can take a
really sativa and cook it to the end so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all nice and amber, plus that will
put you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all, a lot of it's in the trichomes
and how far you take that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you're not in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely, I would be on it as soon as
you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, ideally, if you only have a couple
of plants, like we only have a few plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I've been getting up at like four o
'clock in the morning, when it's ideal to
[SPEAKER_02]: plant it, because then the plant is asleep
and that's actually the time when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get up early in the morning and I get
out there and I'll take the plants down
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I'll hang them and then I'll go
back to bed, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the way I kind of like to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I keep it in a dark room for three
days and during the three days we pull
[SPEAKER_02]: them out and then like I said,
we just cut any of the smaller leaves that
[SPEAKER_02]: are attached to a stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we just get them, so we keep the
big leaves separated from that stuff too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything, any of those small leaves
that are attached to a stem, they go,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything below the cola that we want,
that'll go into making hash vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to do other things with
it, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to dry it, then I don't know,
do whatever you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking for more CBDs,
do you harvest early or late?
[SPEAKER_02]: Early.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Time of day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early, like three to four in the morning,
kind of at the end of their night cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll bring them in the house and
put them in a dark room and then we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: start working for those next three days
and then we'll hang them to dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: With like a light fan on them,
just to barely keep them zizzing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to put a hard fan on them,
you don't want to quick dry them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to make sure to sit in
Northwest where you got some movement
because you don't want any mold or
anything that may already be on the
leaves.
If it's mold sports, it may be on the
leaves to start attacking the neighbor.
Hang it up?
Yeah.
As far as, how many days did you harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: To hang up the colas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, to hang up the colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to probably hang them up
before you put them in the brown paper
[SPEAKER_02]: bags about five days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends on the humidity too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those humidity things, 55 is about the
best humidity.
Can you describe the lawnmower situation
for spraying?
Like, how do you do that?
Like, what is the mechanism?
For what?
For spraying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you like, you hook up a sprayer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like to our little tractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a pump sprayers and you can get
them from Northwest Freight or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a farm supply store.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put them in there and it hooks up
to the batteries on your little mower and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a little pump on there and it
pumps it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for years we did backpack sprayers and
boy, man, those work out on your back and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year I said, okay, I got a couple
hundred extra bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got it and it makes a little
difference because you just sit there and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got pretty good power.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fits out a nice spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally for that what you want is you want
a fogger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have like these still foggers that
are for applying fertilizers and any kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of thing you want to apply for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get in there and fog the whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, if you're really doing it,
that's the ideal way because you get
[SPEAKER_02]: coverage, full, 100% coverage almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not too fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a big mist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably want to wear a mask when you
do it because you'll be breathing it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But besides that, it works really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and another way, at this time of year,
if you get rain, you can shake your plants
[SPEAKER_02]: but works really good as a leaf blower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take a leaf blower like your driveway
blower and go up to your plants and just
[SPEAKER_04]: go, wah!
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this guy, whoosh!
And it really gets the water off.
So leaf blowers work.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a pinch, you've got a job and
you come home and it just rains and you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to save your plant, get your leaf
blower out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just blow that thing because right
now, where we're living, we're starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: see bud rot and people are pulling their
plants because of the rain we had last
[SPEAKER_02]: week here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's buds are this big already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure, they went out and shook them,
but there's too much moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's little pockets and then they're
starting to pop out and you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that stuff goes quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see any problem that I can't stress
enough, as soon as you see that problem,
[SPEAKER_02]: take that thing down like instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: One spot on your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, my rule is one leaf lifts over
and the whole plant is down because it can
[SPEAKER_02]: take 7% of your plant a day because that
stuff is cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't even know if you saw it the
first day or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, it's a race.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't work in years before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would start in February.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't work 9 months to get to the end
and then have it turn to shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we're talking about,
so you hang it for 5 days, you said 50%
[SPEAKER_03]: humidity is ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that 50% humidity in the bud or 50%
humidity in the room?
[SPEAKER_03]: In the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so like 10 or 12% is better in the
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have some of these bud humidity
testers where you put it up against the
[SPEAKER_02]: mud and it can get you.
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 is a little high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 10 or 12 is probably a little more
realistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: People in the past and stuff like that,
it was, oh yeah, we'll just turn it into
[SPEAKER_02]: oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing outdoors and growing in
greenhouses is really so forgiving that
[SPEAKER_02]: you should really never have any spider
mite problems at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's too, they like super dry,
hot, airy, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have all this moist and every
morning there's dew everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just too much moisture and there's
really no reason unless somebody brought
[SPEAKER_02]: the buds in or they brought the russet
bites in, man, you're not, you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and we've been really open with our
farm and thank goodness, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we really haven't had any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problems we did have was a few
years ago we brought some plants in from
[SPEAKER_02]: California and they had russet bites.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was also a year I was doing 90
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought we had all the russet bites
taken care of way earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't really have a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I saw this weird truck drive up
and down the street with a canny vehicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had this weird box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there may be some sort of,
they may be spreading, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: spreading russet bites intentionally to
damage the crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Russet bites first turned up in California
in probably 2010 when some friends of mine
[SPEAKER_02]: in the Cottonwood area said the
helicopters flew over and within four days
[SPEAKER_02]: they dropped russet bites and knocked out
the whole valley, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, these things can happen.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a couple things else you don't
want your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want the little yellow looking
like lady beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not lady beetles, the little
yellow ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you don't want the white
butterflies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go around, you know, they're kissing
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to land on your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, every time they land on your bud
they're laying an egg and you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get bud rot in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to, this time of year they're
like my mortal enemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran around with our swine followers and
I was like, ahhhh!
[SPEAKER_02]: You see if we chase them around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because of one of the bumpers,
you have this big beautiful cola and all
[SPEAKER_02]: of a sudden you crack it up, crack it open
and you see this burrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a burrow in there that's dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got too baked and this is like dead in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your whole bed is ruined.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, ahhhh!
[SPEAKER_02]: That's no good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are a couple things to watch out
for that really, they look cute but
[SPEAKER_02]: they're really not super cute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said you separate out the leaves and
the two, you know, the large leaves and
[SPEAKER_06]: the little ones and then are you
processing them any particular way or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we make ice ash out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both?
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of both of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make ice ash out of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quick, it's easy, it's inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not using any hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not using anything dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really not anything they can say
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, any of the authorities and it's
a better cleaner process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all you're using is ice cold
water, ice and ice cold water and heat and
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's like the four elements or
something like that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it all going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the action, you know, the heat,
the pressure, the cold, the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why you did the thin
slices of the ash to dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you press it back together again,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: We microplane, we squeeze all the water
out and then we put it in the freezer and
[SPEAKER_02]: then that way it stores really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're ready to use it,
we microplane it out so it's fluffy
[SPEAKER_02]: because we know there's still moisture in
there and we've tried to squeeze it like
[SPEAKER_02]: straight out of the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take a chunk off and we go,
wow, it may not have that much moisture on
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happens with the heat and
pressure, it starts boiling in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water doesn't, it blows out the side
of the bag and you got ash mixed in with
[SPEAKER_02]: your, with your, with your ozum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's no good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not ideal, but, and you needed to pause
during the drying process because you
[SPEAKER_05]: weren't going to be able to take care of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there an option to kind of like dry it
for five days, stick it in the freezer and
[SPEAKER_05]: then finish?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never put any, any cannabis
products you ever want to smoke in the
[SPEAKER_02]: freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best thing you can do is put them in
a, keep them in a full craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get those big, huge bags from Home Depot,
those big, you know, the big paper bag,
[SPEAKER_02]: those long leaf bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll keep it regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just slow it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll slow it down and it'll regulate it
too and you won't lose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't want to put, don't ever put
anything in any plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're all about paper and stuff
like that because in the freezer it kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of regulates itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it not so, you know, sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you, those plastic bags,
you build up that moisture, that mold
[SPEAKER_02]: starts happening and it's a mess.
Tom,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to talk a little bit about
preserving?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, preserving?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think the jars work the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got the patience and the time
and you're going to have it around for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while, the jars work the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after it's really cured in the
jars, pack them as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you can suck the air out of
them, you know, they have some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: vacuum sealers that do the jar lids too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suck it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you really want to get as much in
there as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not over-stuffed, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, nice and snug.
[SPEAKER_02]: After you finish the 16 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, after you finish the 16 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I check them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, probably like every 15 to 30 days
after that, you know, just want to give it
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you smell anything that's a little
off, it's time to get a little drier.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then keeping that in the dark?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark hole, dark cool area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like any kind of, you know,
root storage would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plastic root storage facility,
yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have problems with cases?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use trap plants in our farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do is we use plants that the
bugs really like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like in the bug world, green beans,
it's like filet mignon dough, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eggplants, like bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So between filet mignon and bacon,
you know, these bugs are stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll go after the green beans and
they'll go after the eggplants before
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll go after your canvas plant all day
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eggplants are super effective because
you go to anybody's garden and you look at
[SPEAKER_02]: the eggplant, eggplant's always been hit
hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a delicacy, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do is instead of, so we do a
lot of trap plants and stuff like that in
[SPEAKER_02]: companion plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they make this work pretty well,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so we've been incorporating
that in our stuff for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we separate our garden from our canvas
garden by long distance because the bugs
[SPEAKER_02]: like to end the squash, moss, and they
like to hang out in the best new garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we give them everything they could
possibly need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they leave our garden alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's time to separate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not a big fan of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I really haven't tested it that
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of new products on the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll give it a test drive this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've had pretty successful luck,
you know, and generally like it when my
[SPEAKER_02]: canvas isn't tasting so good, my next crop
comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's kind of a wash and then
we can make whatever we want out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's left over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're doing a small, you know,
grow, medical grow or whatever you're for
[SPEAKER_02]: plants or whatever you're allowed,
you know, that's the way I would do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would start them and I would
try to get them as big and as low as you
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly can in line, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's some, if you read the laws,
there's some interesting, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some interesting things you could
probably be doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
