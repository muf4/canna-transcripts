[SPEAKER_02]: It is common for folks, though,
to socialize and medicate outside
[SPEAKER_02]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to hang out, you know,
Jeff's going to give the demo and then
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to, you know, we'll give away
the raffle stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, people kind of hang
out and mingle and then pop outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I hear that there's quite a party
done on the dock and on the boat
[SPEAKER_02]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ferry workers actually tell me that
they actually know about us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, so we've got a reputation.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a really good reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be bummed out with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tonight's demo is from Jeff Church,
also known globally as Cannabis Reverend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff has mastered every modern extraction
technique and most of the ancient ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has traveled the world to learn both
exotic techniques as well as spread modern
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques from the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, he went to Spanavis in Spain
and turned on all sorts of the world
[SPEAKER_02]: famous cannabis legends onto rosin oil and
gave rosin dabs at the Cannabis Museum
[SPEAKER_02]: there in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a patient advocate from way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has been on the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has been in front of the laws helping
people, helping humans get relief since
[SPEAKER_02]: the very early days here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff is presently an extractor at 502
Processor Puffin Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he continues to consult everywhere as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He and his wife have also just welcomed
their second child into the world too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a win.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jeff is absolutely one of my mentors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even more so, I am grateful to be able
to call him a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very much my honor to present to you
Jeff Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that warm introduction,
Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that everybody came out here
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful crowd for a really great
method of hashish extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tonight we're talking about double hash
and it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ice, water, and agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, you have screens that filter
out different sizes of particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have your plant material in one
and then you'll have all of your valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: resins on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a little while for the
cannabis to rehydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to dump that into the
water right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bucket over here, five gallon
bucket, filled up a little over halfway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got some ice in there that's been
cooling the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 133 grams of what was the
strain, Shango?
[SPEAKER_00]: California girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: California girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are from home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, some Dachuan outdoor cannabis right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just little tiny popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll toss it on in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've iced this water previously,
but I'm also going to throw some more ice
[SPEAKER_00]: on the top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of makes a sandwich of ice,
cannabis, and more ice on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll add a little bit more water here
to the top just to make sure that all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis is exposed to this cold
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, I like to let this soak for up
to 30 minutes to rehydrate the material,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if it's dry material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also run fresh material that's
frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes a really nice bubble hash,
but it's not something that you really
[SPEAKER_00]: need to rehydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of toss it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's cold out of the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it into the bucket and start
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so tonight I'm going to just do this
dry material method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you do is you've got several
different sizes of bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smallest one that we have,
which is going to go in first,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a 25 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 25 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 25 micron mesh on some kind of
jacket-type material, yeah, canvas-type
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just set these bags in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like to do all of my mixing in
one bucket rather than inside of the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the first methods that people were
doing, they were mixing inside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found that it actually put some wear
and tear on the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not really something that you
want to do if you want to save your bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: give them as long of a length as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bags in particular are quite old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been being used for about 10 years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will last quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got these back from a friend of
mine that I had loaned them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you wash them in a machine washable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you can definitely wash them in
the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that, you know, you want to
save that for doing that every once in a
[SPEAKER_00]: while, not every run.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do with the bags is I'll
take them after they're done and rinse all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the material out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any resin stuck to the screens,
I'll take some alcohol and use some
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol to free the resins off the screens
and give it another soak as well with some
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put it into a bucket of water
and just kind of massage them around and
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a little hand wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also put them into the washing
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put a cup of vinegar in there with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of gets any kind of musty
smell that they might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of cuts that down a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then make sure you do an extra rinse
on them because you don't want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: that vinegar flavor in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they still smell like vinegar,
that's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so the first bag was a 25 micron
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second bag is a 45 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these sizes, as they get larger,
that's also a larger hole size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we'll move on to a 73 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually run into some issues in the
medical market making products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really don't know where the
contamination came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had some samples that tested
positive for E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they never made it out to patients to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just destroyed the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's definitely a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's bacteria and molds and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will grow on the material,
on the bag material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so yes, we do run these bags at
I-502.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just very careful to keep them
very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you're done doing the wash,
you want to make sure that you wash your
[SPEAKER_00]: bags as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just regular tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually well water where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has really low parts per million in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do use RO water though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely reverse osmosis water is
a popular thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will make their ice cubes out of
reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really gone to that length.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used in the medical side,
we had an ice machine that we were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we hooked up carbon filters to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was good enough for us to have
some good clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tonight we're just using bag bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never really been too worried
about it for my own consumption of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely a concern for the 502
market because your products are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fail microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have lots that you
have to destroy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I guess you can technically extract
those with other methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you're extracting whatever the
molds and bacteria are along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these first three bags that I put in
here, the 25 micron bag, the 45 micron
[SPEAKER_00]: bag, and the 73 micron bag, are where you
generally get your hash each.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next bag that I just slipped in here
is 160 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is your very largest resin
heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you'll get a greenish
material that comes out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 190 micron bag, I have seen only a
couple times anything that you'd really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to smoke come out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's from a plant that has extremely
large resin heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually it's just kind of the green
duff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an extra catch bag for the plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, this blue bag is what's
called the work bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original name for it was the work bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do any of the work in there
anymore, like I said, because it will
[SPEAKER_00]: break up the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a 220 micron bag right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to sell a 250 micron bag,
which I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I rarely use that they kind of said
was for commercial production,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can make sure that you're
getting the most resin out of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 220 micron bag might hold back a
little bit of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might get clogged a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing successive washes will really
help you get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the 250 micron, I kind of just moved
away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the bags right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant material will go in this bucket
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the colors in the numbers standard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the purple is going to be the 25 micron
always.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 45 micron is white.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 73 micron is yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a 120 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to grab this as a prop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble Man was kind enough to send down a
whole set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the coveted door prize right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an orange color, and this is
120 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not using it tonight, but it's
definitely something that I've used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be an extra filter above your
73 micron that can lead to slightly more
[SPEAKER_00]: pure product on your 73 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the purposes of the demonstration
tonight, it's not really necessary to
[SPEAKER_00]: splice it out too terribly much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also one that I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a 90 micron bag, which goes right
above your 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does the same sort of a thing,
kind of splitting the micron size up so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can have a tighter fraction of
the resin heads in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, let's see, is there any other
one that I'm forgetting?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the 160 micron,
red, green for 190, and blue is the work
[SPEAKER_00]: bag, the 220.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're always the same, at least in
the bubble bag brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of other brands out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Bubble Man was the first one in North
America to provide bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been using these bags for
years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, since 2001, I think, was the first
time I got a set of bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually, they offer two
different kinds of bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this standard set here that I'm
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also have the bubble bag
light set, which is slightly cheaper
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, you know, not as heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't carry a warranty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these ones do.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are a lifetime warranty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever have anything that goes wrong
with them, any one of the bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll send you a new bag, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been really good about
honoring that, even with the much larger
[SPEAKER_00]: sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's been no problem to get a
new bag sent down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, the one other screen that you
have is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a 25 micron pressing screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it a blotting screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pressing screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the idea is you put your
hashish on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're able to squeeze out a
little bit of the excess water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of what this is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've kind of moved towards in canvas
extraction is doing rosin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this right here was the very first
screen, at least that I know of,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was used for making rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you put your hashish in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you fold it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you, with heat and pressure,
squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hashish extrudes out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I was actually down in
Oakland with a friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: Space, and he and I were sitting around
saying, hey, you know, how are we going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make this rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody had really put out there in social
media world how to filter your rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're saying, oh, geez,
you know, really what we need is a filter
[SPEAKER_00]: because all of this material is just kind
of running here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get a little bit of high
quality oil out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of it's contaminated with the
rest of the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, you know, hey, we need a
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend Spacey said, hey,
I've got a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a 25 micron filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that it was the method was born
rosin right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, some of the other tools that we
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to dry on parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parchment paper seems to be kind of the
best method for, you know, home use at
[SPEAKER_00]: least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that the cardboard acts as a desk
and it draws out the moisture from the
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish that basically your paper will get
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will draw the moisture out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that draws it away again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a way to mitigate having
too moist hashish because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we were discussing earlier,
there's big issues with microbes as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: One second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would there be any point in setting that
on a low heat source?
[SPEAKER_00]: You would not want to apply heat to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, cold is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat will heat the resin and it'll melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any, there's a possibility that
there's going to be water in there if it
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't dried all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that water will kind of get clogged in
inside of the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll lead to more mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually better to not have it in
a hot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want direct sunlight or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, just, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so the microbial issue is
definitely a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know, it's about eight hours
that it takes for microbes to start
[SPEAKER_00]: growing after water has been introduced to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the drying process, there's going to
be some amount of microbes and bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to really use material
that doesn't have microbes in large
amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to kind of keep that as,
you know, it's just not advisable to run
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's always best to use
the highest quality input that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give you the highest quality
output.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but for the 502 world, what we've kind
of come up with now is a freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you take your material and it
goes right into the freezer and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen, then you pop it into the freeze
dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to keep the material both,
you're able to get less oxidation with the
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to stay a much lighter
color, which is more appealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're also going to have this
microbial issue is basically eating,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't give it the chance to
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes aren't going to bloom in the
freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The freeze dryer is going to sublimate the
water away from the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're going to end up with a dry,
sandy product that hasn't had the chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of clump together and get,
you know, blocked together because it
[SPEAKER_00]: stays all dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin heads are rock hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're cold, so it's able to kind of
dry everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also freezing it will expand in water
that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually kind of moves the resin
heads away from each other just a slight
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that it's able to dry inside of the
patty that you put into the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the freeze dryer is the best
method for drying bubble hash that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it progressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I first started making bubble
hash, there wasn't even a recommendation
[SPEAKER_00]: to use cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was like, you know, use like a
paper plate or use a plate itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was really, really,
you know, there wasn't much out there for
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we came up with the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cardboard seemed to work great except for
with kind of stickier resins, they would
[SPEAKER_00]: get stuck to the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get pieces of paper that came out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of not the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parchment, when that idea came around,
really kind of won me over for sure
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're able to get the material
off of the parchment without having much
[SPEAKER_00]: of the parchment come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully none of the parchment coming
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it not work if you de-carved it
before you started?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you de-carved it, most likely the
resin heads would melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would be inaccessible by the water
extraction method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would definitely melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, unless you're doing a really
long, well yeah, it's big enough to melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so the rest of the tools here
that I have, press the screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: the parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just kind of a banker's box lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just nice for transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to make it somewhere
and move it somewhere else, it's nice to
[SPEAKER_00]: have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just cut up a cardboard box at
home and then tape a piece of parchment to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this seems to be a nice method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use a sieve to break up the
bubble hash so that it can dry properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll put all of your bubble hash into
here and then take a silicone spatula and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of move it around and it'll come
through the sieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can spread it out kind of evenly
on this cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I use just a dish brush to kind
of clean up any excess bubble that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck to this tool so that you don't lose
a whole bunch there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just a plastic card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's nice to move out the
bubble hash if it's too thick of a pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If when you're working with your sieve,
too much of it fell in one area,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can kind of move it around and spread
that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a spoon to get it out of the
bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've used all kinds of different
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other great tools,
but since we're just doing this for home
[SPEAKER_00]: use, I figured a spoon would be a great
thing.
Everybody has one.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a few more minutes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions that people have at
the moment?
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us about the different types of hash
and why you would use one versus another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the different extraction methods that
are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've got this bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a great method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a non-solvent method, although water
is technically solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are terpenes that are water soluble
that are being extracted, but it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the least of the solvent of all of the
methods out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be using screens and kind of
doing a similar thing, but without water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry sift is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives you the unadulterated or
it has the least refinement, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the processes out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of CO2 extraction as well,
but that takes really expensive machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not really a whole method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's a fairly green
solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the CO2 is just waste from
industry that's recaptured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's definitely a nice way to use
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butane extraction, propane, all of those
things are interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those hydrocarbon solvents are great
for getting the cannabinoid content out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the material economically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not very expensive for a setup as
compared to a CO2 extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time that it takes to do the
extraction is much reduced compared to a
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But each of these solvents has a specific
capacity for extracting constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certain things are going to be
extracted with your different solvents
[SPEAKER_00]: that wouldn't necessarily be extracted in
the same way from other solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be good to assume that if you're
using ethanol extraction that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking all the terpenes in an actual form
with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that was actually the very next
one that I was going to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ethanol is a great extraction medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the disadvantage that when you're
going to remove the ethanol from the
[SPEAKER_00]: extract, you're also going to remove a lot
of the terpenes, especially the most
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to just hop on over with
the alcohol, and you're going to end up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a terpene-infused alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because alcohol is a hydrostropic rather
than a hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're together, it's going to
pull a certain amount of water with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's definitely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it will extract the water
content of the plant material as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely a great extraction
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good for RSO and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does ambient room temperature have any
play on the manipulation of the hashees
[SPEAKER_06]: after being extracted or even during
extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so with bubble hash or dry sieve,
you really want to have the coldest
[SPEAKER_00]: environment possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing this extraction in cold
because the resin heads harden up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will also free themselves from the
plant material a lot easier when they are
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just shear off really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just crack like ice would crack,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would definitely recommend that if
you're going to do bubble hash on any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of commercial scale, you want to have a
cold room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either a walk-in freezer that you're
working in or having a room that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: outfitted with an air conditioner that
you've overclocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really cool gadget.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a cool bot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you put this in there and basically
it takes any air conditioner and tricks
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have a little heater that heats up
by the temperature sensor so that the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner thinks that it's not as cold
as it actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it has another sensor that reads
the outtake of the condenser so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: knows when the condenser is going to ice
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically make sure that you're not
going to destroy your equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the same time it overlocks it so
you can get it down to I think it's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: high 30s is what you can get with one of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see a lot of people set their rooms
at 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a common extraction temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing everything, the moment that I
pull the hashish out of the bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's warming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by the time I get it into this
sieve, if I don't work fast enough and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a really gooey stream, it's just
going to gum up all over this sieve and
[SPEAKER_00]: become a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to work fast when you're doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what we've always done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now the new method is cold rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't have to be edgy.
So you only make hash in a month with an
R.
That's definitely a good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happens to be when the harvest is
in usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So traditionally I've made the bulk of the
hashish in the last month of the year and
[SPEAKER_00]: January and February as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are kind of December,
January, February are really, really great
[SPEAKER_00]: months for making hashish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I don't want to tear off too
advanced a topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll forget it if I don't ask you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of the people that I see that
make hash, I'm pretty good on Instagrams,
[SPEAKER_05]: but these guys have a tendency to allow
the bubbles to dry in patties for,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's call it eight to 12 hours or even
longer in cold rooms or refrigerators or
[SPEAKER_05]: something to keep microbial growth rate
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they will either sit or
microplane.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my question to you is, it sounds
like you're, at least in this particular
[SPEAKER_05]: lesson, you're an advocate of taking that
bubble quickly, going through the process
[SPEAKER_05]: very quickly, getting it out there,
spread out so that it can dry very
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly, not awaiting that time and such.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just wondering from your point of
view, do any of the methods that I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about previous to that,
do they hold?
[SPEAKER_05]: Any kind of water creating a more
palatable product or something that may be
[SPEAKER_05]: more melty or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so I would say that there's
definitely advantages to doing the cold
[SPEAKER_00]: cure, putting your hashish into a cold
refrigerator or a freezer as well before
[SPEAKER_00]: you would microplane it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be using the sieve,
I don't really see as much advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: that because you're going to have,
it's going to be so cold that it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to harden it if you put it into the
freezer that it's kind of going to be hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to get through the sieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the microplane is definitely a nice
way to go for really sticky material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's going to come out of your bags
and it's going to be really, really
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky, you're going to want to use a
microplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will actually rupture a lot of
the heads when you're doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: microplaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could lead to a little bit of
terpene loss, but if you've got a really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really sticky product anyways,
you're going to have a high terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: content in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that lead to a more greased out
product even after it's dried?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin heads are all treated
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different amounts of kind of
liquefiable content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess is what we could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabinoids and the terpenes are
really the liquefiable content of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of those constituents that are
in the resin head don't really melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on some strains, you're going to have
pure, pure resin where you don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: see any other contamination when you look
under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not as melty when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because of the nature of the
genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other strains are going to be
super, super melty and hard to feel when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those types of strains really want to
do in the cold room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing a cold cure is definitely a good way
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that nowadays, if you're going
to go through the trouble of making that
[SPEAKER_00]: cold room, get a freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're going to be working
with that type of material, because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to have to do all this cold
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have to do the
microplaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually take this material
that previously, with other methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would have to microplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead, you do the freeze dryer and
it comes out dry like keif.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're pulling that material out
of the freeze dryer, it's frozen,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not in a cold environment,
you're going to have condensation,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to bring water from the
atmosphere and put it right back onto your
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely want to have an
environment that you're doing it in that's
[SPEAKER_00]: cold if you're going to be pulling it out
of the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, sure, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you share why it's called bubble
hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's bubble hash because of the
bubbles that form when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so the more pure than it is,
the more boiling effect that you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have when it smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like a dab boils when you drop it
on the dab rig, it's the same sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really, you know, when bubble hash
first came around, there really wasn't as
[SPEAKER_00]: much oil and there wasn't, you know,
as much of that going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a pure, pure method of
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really explained what the product
was itself that's being produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you go ahead and tell us about
StoreTor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's my good friend Space down in
Oakland who I worked with on developing
[SPEAKER_00]: the rosin screen method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and his partners down there at the
Bizarre, which was a Measure Z club in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Measure Z club is actually a place
where you're allowed to consume and sell
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the city of Oakland will kind
of turn their head the other way and not
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about you because they have a law
that was passed in Oakland, Measure Z,
[SPEAKER_00]: which made it the lowest enforceable
priority for adult consumption and sales
[SPEAKER_00]: in a private setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you're not doing it out in
public, then it's, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they decided that they really needed to
have a hashish rating system because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, back then it was really,
you know, all hash was kind of like 20 or
[SPEAKER_00]: $25 a gram retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't really too much difference in
price, even though the quality could be
[SPEAKER_00]: drastically different, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they came up with the star rating
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one through six star rating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it starts off with one star being
the lowest and that's basically a heaf
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something that you really couldn't
press very easily with just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat and pressure from your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't really press it into a patty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of crumbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two star is something that you press
together and then it'll hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you smoke it on a screen,
it has a slight milk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll kind of have the sheen where you can
kind of tell that the oils have done
[SPEAKER_00]: something, but it's not really boiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really bubbling, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then three star, it'll go from whatever
shape you put it in and it'll melt into
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a pile, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a, it'll make like a haystack kind
of a pile out of whatever you put onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen and it'll boil up into that pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: A four star will melt down into a puddle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be kind of a boiling puddle with
contaminants in it, so non-milty
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents all over in that puddle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll kind of have like a,
there'll be like a flat chunk of
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant after it stops melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five star, it'll melt down into the puddle
and it'll actually boil the contaminant
[SPEAKER_00]: out to the edges of the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all being rated on the screen
because it's kind of the easiest way to
[SPEAKER_00]: view what's actually happening with the
milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the contaminant will get pushed out and
it'll boil a big clear dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a big bubble that has no
contaminant in it, except for on the very
[SPEAKER_00]: edges of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually shows the screen so that
you'll have a bare spot in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the screen and contaminant in a ring
around the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then six star, which is, you know,
the height of what you can produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: will boil and it doesn't really collect
contaminant in any one place in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be very, very little
contaminant on the screen and most likely
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll melt right through the screen and
you won't have anything left over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the star rating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought that up here to Washington and a
lot of the communities in the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: community adopted that star rating system
as well as the company that I was working
[SPEAKER_00]: for at the time or owned at the time,
Conscious Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of pushed that forward here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, this is going to happen to you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in watching you put together the bags,
at least for this demonstration,
[SPEAKER_05]: you skipped a couple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And which, you know, totally I get how all
that puts together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in looking for a hatch at the end,
as far as you're going to try to achieve
[SPEAKER_05]: that six star rating, do you feel it is
absolutely always necessary to just use
[SPEAKER_05]: all the bags and split it up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is there a way to tell or is there a
way to at least guide people in knowing,
[SPEAKER_05]: okay, I can use the 73 and the 90 and
maybe the 120?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, you know, I mean, for today's
market, the 502 market, I'd really like to
[SPEAKER_00]: have two grades, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having a lot of different bags,
that's kind of tough, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also have a third grade that
would be all of the other grades that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't the super milky varieties that you
can press and browse with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, it's definitely something that you
would want to have more screens in there
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to try and make that six
star.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, that six star is dependent not
on the screens that you use, but on the
[SPEAKER_00]: material that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have good starting material,
you're going to have an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a five star where you're using
less of the bags, you throw another one in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you might get that six star
because, you know, because you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more filtration, you were able
to get out a little bit more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's all about the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material is key for sure in the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to start this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably been, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to do a five minute spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my drill here and it's got a
variable speed on, so it's able to go
[SPEAKER_00]: slow, it's able to go fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a submit mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like this head here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rounded, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have any sharp edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharp edges are going to lead to breaking
your material up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got the rounded edges,
it's going to just thrash your material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to bump into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your resin heads are going to fall off and
your plant material is not going to break
[SPEAKER_00]: up as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll give her a whirl here,
five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five minutes of agitation and then I'll
take this and just dump it into this
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually dump almost all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then give a little swish to get any
resin that might be down at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to keep my bucket clean,
so I'll usually put some water in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and wash out any last little bits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we wait again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, five more minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like to give it a little stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually in practice, it's either five
or it's either 10 or 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wait from the time it stops mixing until
I start pulling the bags out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tonight we'll just do the 10 minutes
just to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're waiting for now is the resin
to sink, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now there's kind of this matrix
of plant material and ice and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the resin is denser than water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it will actually sink down to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're waiting for it to do a little
bit of sinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can also give a little more
agitation five minutes later to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: mix any bits that are still stuck on the
plant material that have settled on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material and allow that to drain
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any merit to putting on a little low
vibration table?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, totally could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like it might help move
things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people definitely do that with Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're making Keith, they put a
little vibrator on their Keith screens and
[SPEAKER_00]: bounce the resin off so you don't have to
break the plant material up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's cold in the room, it should shear
off really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a question about washing machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's kind of two ways to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method, at first it was like a cake
mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I used for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we moved to the drill with a paint
mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the paint mixer, it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I found the cement mixer,
it was just that perfect tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the washing machines are really an
interesting method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you do with the washing machine is
you fill the little, it's like a desktop
[SPEAKER_00]: type washing machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually make bigger ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you fill it with some ice and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put your plant material into
a bag that is all the mesh that's at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom of this 220 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all 220 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a zipper on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you put that into your washing machine
and just turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can set it for however many
minutes you want to do your wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got a little hose and you
drain it right into your bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's definitely an easy way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen similar qualities come from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that if you're doing the fresh
frozen, I've seen a lot of people have
[SPEAKER_00]: better success with fresh frozen using the
washing machine than they have with the
[SPEAKER_00]: drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the dry trim, it seems that the
drill is better for me at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of my personal preference
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes sir?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to assume that at work you
probably use the 20 gallon washers then?
[SPEAKER_00]: At work we do dry material there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we actually use the same setup but
in 32 gallon bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just a rubber made brook trash
bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually buy the white ones that are
food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're actually, it's a little higher
quality plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually put food into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, but then we use the freeze dryer
for the finish.
[SPEAKER_05]: So are you using the bigger washing
machines?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't use a washing machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a little bit beefier of a drill at
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just like my personal home drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the same thing's included.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use on the 20 gallon set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are you draining into a 20 gallon
set of bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I've got a 32 gallon trash bin
that actually holds the 20 gallon set of
[SPEAKER_00]: double bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the trash bin that works the best
for those bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen bags that are side walls are
all mesh or at least extended mesh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever used those?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you like those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all mesh bags are definitely great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say, yeah, I just use the
bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I have and it's what I've
used for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like to support the bubble
man in his endeavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although he doesn't really need too much
of my support nowadays.
[SPEAKER_05]: So draining into 20 gallon bags is not
like a big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't imagine trying to drain a 20
gallon trash can into a five gallon set of
[SPEAKER_05]: bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would probably take a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that just drain quicker?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're just able to hold all that
water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing it into, if you're
draining your big 20 gallon washer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably want a 20 gallon set of bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: To hold all that water so that you can
drain it all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also, a lot of people will use
another method where they'll cut the
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll stack, they'll put one
bag in each bucket, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then stack these buckets inside of
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the very bottom one, they've just got
a whole bunch of holes drilled in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do it in a sink or they do it
outside where it's okay for the water to
[SPEAKER_00]: just drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do it into a big tub, you know,
where they've got it kind of raised up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could use a 20 gallon washer
with five gallons of bucket, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and if you're using the all mesh
screens, there's much more surface area of
[SPEAKER_00]: mesh for your water to move through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's, you're moving your hashish
through, but it's also really how fast is
[SPEAKER_00]: your water going to drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the all mesh bags are great for
kind of doing that sort of a method where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using the smaller bags with a
larger washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think because this has got more of
the terpenes in it, it would be a better
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it just really depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that you're going to have more
of a strain specific effect from bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it has all of those terpenes in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really, Ethan, he just left.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd probably be the one to talk to about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whether having something that's
full of terpenes would be better for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody with cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not 100% sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not done enough studying for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that you really see the
modulating effects of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, the terpenes that are in there
from bubble hash versus having an alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: extract where a lot of those terpenes are
gone or changed because in the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: process, they do change, you know,
and break down molecularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would not be D-card, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you were going to eat
just bubble hash straight, it would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: THC acid that you're consuming rather than
THC that's been converted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, during the act of smoking,
it's doing that D-card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff, are we doing really well?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got about a 15-minute window left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm going to pull this and we'll
have it on the tray within 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would say that when I'm doing
this at home, I'm going to be doing four
[SPEAKER_00]: washes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just four at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do four washes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done up to 12 washes on certain
strains and come up with multi-material.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do at home is do the four
washes and then take it and throw all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant material into a crock pot,
take some of this bubble water that's left
[SPEAKER_00]: over and fill the crock pot up and throw a
whole bunch of coconut oil into the crock
[SPEAKER_00]: pot and cook that to get the remaining
cannabinoids out of the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really a great method to
get the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get something really nice to smoke and
you get something that's going to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: effective to eat as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get going here on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give a little jiggle while it's
in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give it a little shake to get
any of the resin that has gone down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom to drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm doing my first and second pulls,
I really try to just pull it out and move
[SPEAKER_00]: it around like this so that the water is
draining over the different parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen and washing any of the resin heads
out of there, but not squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you squeeze it, you're going to have a
lot of the plant material that has broken
[SPEAKER_00]: down go through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the plant material has floated
up to the top and the resin heads have
[SPEAKER_00]: come down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to try and keep that
separation as much as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the third and fourth run, I start
giving it a little bit more of a squeeze
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that I'm getting the most out
of it, but those are lower grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take your bucket, come back over to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to stretch the bag back over it and
then you just dump it back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's ready to go again for another
watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always handy to have a nice place to
sit and rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your bags as you're pulling out
another bucket set off to the sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff, if you're going to do that a second
time, will you pick the second bucket up
[SPEAKER_03]: so everybody can see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Second bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one on the floor?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you're going to do that
for every wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I mean, we're just going to do
the one tonight for time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we've got there.
So if you were doing this for real,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're going to do four washes,
would you have that one back on ice at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point in time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's still on ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would pull all these bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still on ice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, there's plenty of ice in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just plain material that's been
brushed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then as you pull your screens,
I like to take the screen and fold it over
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you kind of this shape where it
draws everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of it being a flat circular
screen, I'm going to just give it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: dump to make sure that you've gotten all
the resin that can fall through the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: to fall through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any advantage to doing four
washes as opposed to like one more wash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so when it's in the bag after you've
done your mixing, there's resin that's
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck on the plain material, and so it
kind of helps you wash it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to do 20 minutes,
say, of mixing, you're going to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantage of it's going to be broken
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to lose that ability to
have the higher quality resin that you
[SPEAKER_00]: pull from the very beginning of it,
and you're going to get a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every pull kind of generates some
quality a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grades in yield as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be less and less of a
yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sir, with that being said, let's just say
the 90 micron that you pull on pull one,
[SPEAKER_05]: is that not the same as the 90 on pull
three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, depending on how your
material is, if there's a lot of dirt in
[SPEAKER_00]: it, or you have power and mildew,
or you have issues like that, that first
[SPEAKER_00]: wash might be lower quality than the
second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm working with outdoor material,
a lot of times I'll throw the material
[SPEAKER_00]: into the water, and then without beating
it up, just kind of getting it all wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it in the bags and pull that out so
that you wash off any of that dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't want to do too much because
the resin is going to fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that resin can be saved.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you do get, the dirt and the resin,
can be saved in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still think that I'm cold in water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually don't put ice in there,
but it's like cold out of the tap.
Cold out of the tap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff, can I ask you a question?
[SPEAKER_06]: With all the rain we had this year,
did you have much dirt on those flowers
[SPEAKER_06]: out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely some dirt on the bottom
pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, that came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like splash up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the cleanest microbial accounts
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor cultivations, definitely,
you're going to have some dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing in dirt, and the rain,
it splashes back up onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the huge pile of cannabis that one
grower, this mountain of cannabis that he
[SPEAKER_00]: burned, he's just like, ah, it just went
to mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew so much cannabis this year,
they couldn't take care of it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem with a lot of the 502
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're first startup, they don't
really plan for having issues like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin will collect itself on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give a little wash to it,
but it does a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets it all down into the center of the
screen, but it also washes away some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the smaller particles that you haven't
gotten out of there, and it also washes
[SPEAKER_00]: this water that is basically a cannabis
tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It washes that out of the product,
so it gives you a little bit cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in practice, I would use a pump
sprayer, like a agricultural sprayer with
[SPEAKER_00]: ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be cold, cold water that
you're spraying in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just spraying around the inside of
the bag, or are you actually trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: force material through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're really spraying the resin
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come around, and you guys can peer in here
and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
Wow.
Family.
Well, it's just a corner.
It's a little too big.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm calling that first product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cali girl.
Love that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the secondary wash is going to be
not quite the same amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say it's more than half the amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would get half again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's diminishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your yield will diminish as you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will discover substantial amount
more by washing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I like to do is, at least at home,
is put it over a bucket like this and
[SPEAKER_00]: create a suction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just drawing the water through the
screen by pulling down on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use these pressing screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this small amount, I'm just going
to use this method here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to take your spoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Describe what you're doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just screaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get some?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm doing is just cleaning up the
screen with the spoon and then putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the sieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll just work it here, work it
through the sieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just to help it dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to break it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that it doesn't dry in a clump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not going to say no,
because I believe all parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant are valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for consumption, to get you high,
I would say probably not very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't really say for sure because I
haven't done the research to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say what you have there is the
stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have the rosette of gland cells,
which is the manufacturing plant for all
[SPEAKER_00]: the turkeys and cannabinoids inside the
rosette.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you have there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you find using a smaller sieve is
easier than using a larger one?
This little sieve, I would not use in
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually use a larger one because
it's much easier to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what I could grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite sieve is one from IKEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Idealist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put a kilo of resin into the
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, when you're scaling up and doing
a lot larger, it's kind of the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I just take the bag off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of resin left on
there, but not too terribly much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just come over here and give it a little
wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This water is really cold, so it's going
to help Abe getting it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here, this looks fairly good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to kind of clean it up just
a little bit really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the tools, I use this brush on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just brush any of the resin
that's going to stick to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you brush it off right away,
it doesn't stick so much to the card that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't get it all off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it's going to cake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gets nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can keep your tools pretty clean
by using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the 45 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 73 is generally going to be your
highest grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most cannabis plants produce a trichrome
that falls in that 73 micron and above
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of sativas that have
smaller resin heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different varieties that
have larger resin heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a cross-section of the size of
resin heads out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 73 seems to be a really good screen to
capture them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're washing it, you're adding
contaminant as well as you're freeing
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant and freeing resin heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're taking the fraction that has
the most resin heads present in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have the least amount of
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're able to have a higher quality
product just because you've got more resin
[SPEAKER_00]: that was in the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mentioned cuticles before and their
thickness.
[SPEAKER_06]: How big of a role does that have in
helping to get off the head of the stalk
[SPEAKER_06]: without damaging it or opening it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's definitely huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some resin, even when it's really,
really cold, is going to be cemented to
[SPEAKER_00]: the stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be really hard to thresh
it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to work with your material,
find out if it's worthwhile to process
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of material with that method.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not, send it over and do a solvent
category.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you find more ease with certain types
like a sativa?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you find it easier to manipulate over
an indica?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say Afgui is one of my very
favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin flies free from the plant
material and it's also really caked in
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's also one of the strains that
I've run up to 12 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the 12th run, it was still a
three-star.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very much worth it for me to do
that, but I was just tired at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the 12th run.
If you did run up to that situation,
could you just let the marijuana sit
overnight in cold water in the fridge or
something and start over the next day?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not recommend soaking it for too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any definitive proof,
but I believe that there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: some amount of water that's going to come
into the resin head itself and moisturize
[SPEAKER_00]: that resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that 30 minutes of soaking is
where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of on the side of that because I
have done that.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you come back the next morning,
even if you've got tons of ice in there,
[SPEAKER_05]: your plant material is just going to be
mush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you run it again, you're going
to have so much excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, the plant material is going to
break up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I pulled just a little bit wetter
than the first one, so you can kind of see
[SPEAKER_00]: what not to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have an amount of moisture in
there, but you don't want to have too much
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in there or else it just kind of
cakes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the pieces that did go
through the sand on the second part are
[SPEAKER_00]: more clumped together, and that's not
ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to do more free pieces there.
So you can use the plastic to push it
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so kind of like see how this is
coming together.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, it can work, but it just smears
around when it's too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, just rinse the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, after you're done, I can't say
enough, it's very important to wash your
[SPEAKER_00]: bags when you're totally done with the
process to keep them in the best
[SPEAKER_00]: condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: With ice or water?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's resin stuck on the screen,
use on the screen itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isopropyl alcohol is great, but usually
just water is what I like to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're draining the last bag,
it's a little slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of give it a little up and
down the shirt like that, but gentle,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it on the big 20 gallons,
I don't suggest that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole nother method that you
would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it can rip the screen during
this, this will free the resin heads that
[SPEAKER_00]: are clogging the screen and get them back
into the water and allow for more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water to drain more rapidly.
That's the 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the 25 micron here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't you consider that to be a lesser
quality than some of the other ashes?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say on the screen, possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I ran yesterday was a bunch of
stevits, and the 25 micron was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 73 was still my highest grade,
but it definitely still melted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that 25 is a great rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin is my answer for anything that
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I were to say rosin, what is rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin is a method of heat pressure
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you do is you basically take a heat
source a lot of people at home can use a
[SPEAKER_00]: flat iron, like a hair straightener,
and you use parchment, and you take the
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish, you put it into a screen,
you fold that over, and then you've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: in-between piece of parchment,
and you take the hair straightener and
[SPEAKER_00]: squish it, and the liquefiable contents,
the cannabinoids, the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the waxes, some other constituents
that are inside of the rosin will move
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the screen and you can collect
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the contaminant, the non-milty
parts of the hashish will stay in the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way to make hash oil without
solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to give this little tug of oil
while I'm scraping, so keep it from being
[SPEAKER_00]: wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's moisture on the other side of the
screen, and the moment you stop pulling on
[SPEAKER_00]: that and creating the suction,
the moisture wicks right back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is just all really stuck to the
screen, so if you didn't have this little
[SPEAKER_00]: brush technique, you'd be like,
oh jeez, what do I do with all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the brush, you'll get it right off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're drying the hash,
are you just drying the water that you
[SPEAKER_05]: basically added to that drying plant
matter, or is there somehow now like water
[SPEAKER_05]: that's somehow soaked into the membrane of
the resin?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really drying the water that you
put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on the outside of the plant,
basically.
Well, the reason why I ask is just because
listening to people talk and stuff,
I'm not going to get into any of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people would advocate for like a
three month drying time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, that's definitely going to dry
your resin more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have more turpentine wax
because the turpentines will migrate out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the resin head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, but I'd say that the fresher you
can smoke it, the more turpentine content
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as long as it's going to be shelf
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if you were doing this, would you
repeat this in three more times?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how much more would you get based on
what you've got there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you get 50% more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, at least.
At least.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you started with 130 foot grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to end up with there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally you're going to have in
between five and the highest I've ever had
[SPEAKER_00]: was 17% on that activity stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from your original plant materials
weight, you'll have 5% on account of the
[SPEAKER_00]: low end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a little bit less than 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, but it just kind of depends on
the starting material.
Are you going to reuse the water that's in
that bucket now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would reuse this water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tea with that water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I mean, you could totally
drink this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually fermented it with,
I've added sugar and yeast and fermented
[SPEAKER_00]: it into a wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did you say you were going to dry
that for?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke it tomorrow without it
sizzling and popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to put it into a storage
container, you'll want to wait a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, definitely having a colder
environment is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to melt the resin heads and
trap water in there as readily if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a colder environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
