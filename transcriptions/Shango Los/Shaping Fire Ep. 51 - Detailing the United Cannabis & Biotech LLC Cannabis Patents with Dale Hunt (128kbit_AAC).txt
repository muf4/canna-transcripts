[SPEAKER_00]: We are experiencing a clash of
civilizations right now in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, the heritage of
cannabis is sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always shared cannabis flowers and
seeds and insight on how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the center of cannabis culture is the
whole idea of Puff Puff Pass and not to
[SPEAKER_00]: bogart the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: While certainly there were some folks who
may not have wanted you to circulate their
[SPEAKER_00]: special cut of some strain or another,
the vast majority of time cannabis folks
[SPEAKER_00]: shared whatever they had because we were
all sharing in the oppression of the
[SPEAKER_00]: government through prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now though, the emerging licensed cannabis
market is based on ownership, extravagant
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging, and intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very significant change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't say that the schism is within
the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that it's within the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, generally, those who are
seeing the green rush as a quick way to
[SPEAKER_00]: grab it all are often outsiders coming in,
or long time insiders working with newly
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible outside capital investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know how corrupting sudden
access to piles of cash can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways that companies are trying
to take advantage of the young
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure of the cannabis industry is
by filing exceptionally broad patents and
[SPEAKER_00]: daring for anyone to try to take them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because few people have the depth of
pockets to take them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly I'm making some pretty big
generalizations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're watching the cannabis scene
evolve, you know that on the whole I am
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly I know some newcomers to
cannabis who have their heart in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also certainly true that some of
the heritage folks were not all that kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intellectual property is legal though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you either are or are not filing for
an over broad patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not accidentally lawyer up and file
a patent that pretty much says you
[SPEAKER_00]: invented an entire product category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not like accidentally bogarting the
joint while talking too much before
[SPEAKER_00]: passing it.

[SPEAKER_00]: Today my guest is plant scientist and
patent attorney, Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale has extensive experience with patent
protection with a technical emphasis in
[SPEAKER_00]: life sciences like cellular biology,
genetics, genomics, immunology,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology, molecular biology,
pharmaceuticals, protein engineering,
[SPEAKER_00]: stem cells, transgenics, agriculture,
plant genetics, plant patents,
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant variety protection, amongst a
whole bunch of other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale also has experience with patent
portfolio management and strategy advice,
[SPEAKER_00]: international intellectual property
manners, intellectual property due
[SPEAKER_00]: diligence, and licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pretty much does it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having started as a botanist and plant
geneticist, Dale continued his study of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant biology at the cellular and
molecular level, completing a PhD at UC
[SPEAKER_00]: San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale then went on to UC Berkeley for law
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale has spoken at Emerald Cup as a panel
expert on cannabis patents, and Dale is
[SPEAKER_00]: also a pretty great all-around guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His law firm is called Plant and Planet,
if that tells you anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're gonna talk in detail about two
of the most hotly discussed cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patents that presently exist, and what
breeders and cannabis lovers everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: can do to help support open access to
cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Dale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though we've done quite a few
shows about cannabis patenting at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point, I think it's really important to
bring people up to the now in the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between plat patents versus use
patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people who are new to
this topic of cannabis patents they kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of just picture them all in one big
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we're gonna be talking about
both plant and use patents today,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good to get us right on the
same page of what the differences are
[SPEAKER_00]: between those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you start there, please?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'd be happy to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the easiest way to think about
how to distinguish these things is to
[SPEAKER_01]: think about the fact that a plant
selection, a plant variety, a cultivar can
[SPEAKER_01]: be seen as a unique thing, a unique result
of creative effort by a plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it can be seen as an invention that has
lots of different applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, they're both true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason I set it up that way is
that a plant patent is meant to cover the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant as a unique thing and it protects
against copying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the best analogy that exists in
intellectual property is to say that a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant patent is a lot like a copyright on
a plant variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only protects against direct copying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't protect against similarity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't protect against independent
derivation of something even with the same
[SPEAKER_01]: parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only protects clonal copying of that
exact genotype as well as its harvested
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: In contrast, a utility patent is,
it can cover the same underlying plant
[SPEAKER_01]: variety, but it treats it like an
invention that you can use in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that you can potentially claim in a
lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I mean by that is with a utility
patent, one of your claims, and I should
[SPEAKER_01]: just stop and explain, a patent claim is
like a fence around your invention.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the definition of the boundaries
between what you invented and what still
[SPEAKER_01]: is out there outside the scope of your
coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're doing a utility patent,
you can claim your invention any way you
[SPEAKER_01]: want as long as you can demonstrate to the
patent examiner that it is new and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not obvious and that it has utility and
that it's not outside of what's called
[SPEAKER_01]: patentable subject matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I treat my plant variety as an
invention, one of the claims I could write
[SPEAKER_01]: would be the cannabis plant or a plant,
yeah, a cannabis plant typified by,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not finding the best words for it
right now, but a cannabis plant typified
[SPEAKER_01]: by the seeds that are on deposit under
accession X, Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or cannabis plants related to the seeds
that are on deposit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do it this way, you do need to
make a seed deposit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then that, so that could be claim one
is defining the plant based upon the
[SPEAKER_01]: deposit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next claim could be something like
progeny of the plants of claim one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another claim could be an extract made
from the plants of claim one or claim two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an extract made from that variety or
from its progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have a claim to a method of
breeding cannabis comprising having the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant of claim one as one of the parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what this does is it makes it so that
you can protect that variety a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: broadly than just straight up clonal
copying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can protect, well, you can maintain
exclusivity as to the right to breed with
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant if you care to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's how you want to claim it,
you can have control over the extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: who can make extracts and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you think about each of these
claims as a fence around the property of
[SPEAKER_01]: your invention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's nothing inherently right or
wrong about either one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant patents are a little less expensive
and faster to grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Utility patents do take a longer process
to persuade the examiner that each one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these claims is actually worthy of patent
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in both cases, they're really going to
be focused upon the variety that the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in both cases, in my opinion,
it's well within the right of the breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: to protect that kind of invention or that
kind of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually never really thought about the
idea of a breeder having a choice which
[SPEAKER_00]: one they wanted to pursue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize that there was so much
overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was either clearly going to
be a plant patent or it was clearly going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a use patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, there's a lot of overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how you'd file contains a lot of
strategy about what you expect your
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually wrote a blog about this
topic because it came up so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted people to be able to
understand kind of the analytical pathway
[SPEAKER_01]: you go down to decide what kind of IP
protection you need for your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blog is titled something like Let's
Talk About Reproduction and How You Will
[SPEAKER_01]: Get Paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have all my blogs on plantlaw.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point of that blog and the point
of the analysis is that if you are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to protect your plants, if you're going to
sell clones, let's say, you want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to control who is allowed to make
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's how you're going to make
your money, you need a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also need more than that because
you still need to control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be careful about who makes the
clones and who sells them because it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to go out and copy a plant and make
more clones that the patent will give you
[SPEAKER_01]: the right to stop someone from making
those clones if you're willing to litigate
[SPEAKER_01]: against them and if you even find out
about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's always best if you're selling
clones to only work with someone that you
[SPEAKER_01]: really trust to make the clones and to
restrict what's done with the clones
[SPEAKER_01]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, maybe you've got a
variety that has just as a great flower
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and you want that to be as
accessible to people as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to be in a lot of
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you want there to be a lot of
harvested material that's available for
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial access, but you don't really
want somebody to just grab a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: your propagating material and start to
compete with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole reason you got a patent
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're selling clones only so
that other people can propagate and sell
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested material, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you should restrict, even then,
you should restrict what they can do with
[SPEAKER_01]: those clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gets into some other complicated
areas that are probably beyond what we
[SPEAKER_01]: should go into today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm happy to explain those in more
detail with if anyone's interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, OK, that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're selling clones, you've got to go
with the plant patent because that's well,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's one thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a simpler option.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're selling seeds, it's really
important to understand that a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: patent won't even protect that because the
plant patent only protects direct clonal
[SPEAKER_01]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not protect seed progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're really your only choice if
you're selling seeds is you have a utility
[SPEAKER_01]: patent if it's a high THC variety or if
it's industrial hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also something that you can protect
through the USDA Plant Variety Protection
[SPEAKER_01]: Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called the Plant Variety Protection
Certificate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to stop here to explain
that the rest of the world is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I get I was actually challenged
by someone who said, you're giving bad
[SPEAKER_01]: advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should tell everybody to seek UPOV
type protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, UPOV is an acronym for it's a for a
French.
[SPEAKER_01]: The French title of this convention is
basically the English version is the
[SPEAKER_01]: International Convention on Protection of
Plant Varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it establishes plant breeders rights
that you can apply for in any member of
[SPEAKER_01]: this convention and those plant breeders
rights are very.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cover both seeds and clones,
but they have some exemptions that make
[SPEAKER_01]: them a little bit problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone can breed with something that is
covered by a UPOV certificate.
[SPEAKER_01]: As there's this express breeders exemption
so that if you obtain UPOV rights,
[SPEAKER_01]: but someone has access has legitimate
access to your plants, you can't stop them
[SPEAKER_01]: from using that plant to breed other
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now some people may say that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great result.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great public policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It enhances the diversity of what people
have access to for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so the rest of the bottom line
here is the rest of the world is different
[SPEAKER_01]: in the way it protects plant varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The US is unique in having really three
different approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: The USDA PVP approach, which is like UPOV
in the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The USPTO plant patent, which is like a
copyright, and the USPTO utility patent,
[SPEAKER_01]: which treats the plant like any other
invention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for that explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can I can already see I can already hear
the breeders strategizing in their head on
[SPEAKER_00]: the other side of the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for folks who are listening,
because you yourself are a breeder and you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have to think through this
strategy for yourself, stick around for
[SPEAKER_00]: the second set of the show where we're
going to be talking with Dale in detail
[SPEAKER_00]: about about what actions that you can take
to actually protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, during the first set,
I want to I want to shift with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale, because now that we generally have
an idea that the area that we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, I would like you to give us some
good detail on the two probably most
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about patents that that cannabis
folks, especially to heritage growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: are calling over broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and certainly these names have been
coming up a ton since the Phyllis debacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, people have been discussing
the biotech LLC patent for a few years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give credit to Amanda Chicago Lewis when
she wrote that story in Rolling Stone that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of made it apparent to everybody what
was going on and kind of brought it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the public consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know how people talk on the
Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: My God, all these people who have either
wrong information or they're or an
[SPEAKER_00]: incomplete set of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody's got an opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I figure as both a plant scientist
and a patent attorney, you are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to offer us some rare insight into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's let's the first of the two I want
to talk about is the biotech LLC patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would like take us from square
one, explain what the patent is,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the two sides of the debate and
share your thoughts if you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this patent is definitely a utility
patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's there's actually a family of
patents that have similar strategies to
[SPEAKER_01]: cover related subject matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just talk about the the one that
gets talked about the most, which is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, I'll get you the number of the
patent.
It's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where'd it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's patent number 9370164 and anyone who
wants to follow along at home can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: Google that and they'll probably be able
to get a copy of the patent right in front
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's 9370164.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there are a few of them that are
like this, but this is a good one to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know how I talked about the fact
that when you have a utility patent,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can claim it any way you can claim
your invention any way you want,
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as you can persuade the examiner
that the that what you've claimed is new
[SPEAKER_01]: and not obvious and adequately described.
[SPEAKER_01]: And falls within allowable subject matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should explain what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: The allowable subject matter thing is
comes from Section 101 of the patent
[SPEAKER_01]: statute, and it just says that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the court interpretation of Section
101 is that there are certain things that
[SPEAKER_01]: are just not patentable, including laws of
nature and products of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can get into more detail about
that when we talk about the next patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, this the kinds of claims
in this patent are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not restricted by Section 101,
and so the patent examiner would look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the claim and ask is this new?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this obvious and has it been adequately
described and the patent examiner clearly
[SPEAKER_01]: was reached the an answer to a yes answer
to all three of those questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to walk through the claim and
then we can talk about whether that yes
[SPEAKER_01]: answer was was appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so claim one, which is typical and
it's the only claim will spend any time on
[SPEAKER_01]: because it has a lot of claims and it
would get tedious, but it claims a pan of
[SPEAKER_01]: a cannabis plant or an asexual clone of a
plant or a plant part or a tissue or a
[SPEAKER_01]: cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That produces a female inflorescence,
so basically it's a female cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has at least 3% THC and at least 3%
CBD and a terpene profile that is not
[SPEAKER_01]: mercy and dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a terpene oil content greater than 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's some other other language in
the claim that just talks about what the
[SPEAKER_01]: other terpenes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty standard list of terpenes as
far as I've been told, and then it also
[SPEAKER_01]: talks about how those terpenes are
measured as measured by gas
[SPEAKER_01]: chromatography.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last phrase is we're in a
representative sample of seed producing
[SPEAKER_01]: said plants has been deposited under and
then there's a list of accession numbers,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they made several seed deposits as
representative samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's important about this claim is that
this is what I would call and what other
[SPEAKER_01]: people have called it a chemo type claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not limited to any of those
particular samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they deposited multiple samples
and said it's just representative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this this claim would cover by most
people's interpretation, and I've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: stop and just say I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not providing any legal advice to
anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is my educational analysis
kind of of the way patent law works as
[SPEAKER_01]: applied to an exemplary claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone needs legal advice on this,
I get I dig a lot, lot deeper and provide
[SPEAKER_01]: legal advice in a way that is much,
much more detailed, so no one should rely
[SPEAKER_01]: on this as any kind of legal advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is educational only alright,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've been told by lots of people is
that this chemo type.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is one that has been around for a long
time that people can point to examples of
[SPEAKER_01]: other cannabis plants that pre existed the
filing date, and let's go back and look at
[SPEAKER_01]: that filing date so we can be clear about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The filing date of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patent is.
[SPEAKER_01]: July, let's see, sorry it's well the the
filing date is July 17th, 2015 and the
[SPEAKER_01]: earliest date that it claims back to,
which matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patent eligibility analysis is always
a function of different dates and then was
[SPEAKER_01]: there anything before those dates that was
out there in the public domain and was
[SPEAKER_01]: known.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the earliest date that this is entitled
to under any theory is going to be March
[SPEAKER_01]: 15th, 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to the kind of the public
discussion of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people, lots of people who say
that this particular chemo type pre
[SPEAKER_01]: existed 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can point to other strains or
cultivars of cannabis that are at least 3%
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, at least 3% CBD and and are not
Mersene dominant and that have greater
[SPEAKER_01]: than 1% terpene oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to emphasize that I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't independently analyzed any
cultivars and I haven't fact checked
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone's assertions about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from here on out, this is a discussion
of the way the patent law would work if
[SPEAKER_01]: those assertions were true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this does expose one of the
fundamental problems with with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any kind of cannabis patents with any kind
of breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is that when the examiner is
looking at this claim and trying to decide
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's new or non obvious, they don't
just put their finger in the wind and and
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a particular procedure that they
go through and they do this for biotech
[SPEAKER_01]: patents, medical patents, airplane
engines, electronic devices, anything at
[SPEAKER_01]: all that you that you're claiming to have
invented.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they do is they look at the claim and
then they do a search involving keywords
[SPEAKER_01]: and categories to try to find the closest
thing they can find to this claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they look in in other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will have at least tens of thousands
or hundreds of thousands of moderately
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant academic papers to look at in the
overall database of what's already known.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in the public knowledge?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll they'll do a search.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a biotech case, they might they
might really have access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they would easily have access to
over 100,000 different academic papers and
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as they they would also search all
of the prior patent literature and they
[SPEAKER_01]: look for whatever is closest to that
claim, and then they use that as a basis
[SPEAKER_01]: for rejection of the claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost always a case that a claim
will be rejected the first time around,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's almost it's kind of the
examiner's job to explain why the well to
[SPEAKER_01]: say that the claim isn't allowable for
these reasons and then put it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: applicant to explain why those reasons are
incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the reason I'm going in all this
detail is that suppose now you're an
[SPEAKER_01]: examiner handling the first ever chemo
type patent application for for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go through your normal procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look in all the academic literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how much academic literature is there
on this topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little, but not very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not remotely, not not even orders of
magnitude within the same amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: literature that is typically available for
a patent search.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you look at all the prior patent
literature and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhat surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: To some people, the USPTO has been
handling and granting cannabis related
[SPEAKER_01]: patents all the way back to the 40s,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the first time anyone had tried
to claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: A chemo type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the examiner can't just say this seems
like it's too broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: The examiner has to have a basis for
rejecting the claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: The examiner looks in the so called prior
art.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole public database of prior
literature, academic literature,
[SPEAKER_01]: or patents and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't really find anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe find something that's kind of
close, but not not all the way close,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe find something that looks like
it, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem in utility patents with
cannabis is that there is just a complete
[SPEAKER_01]: disconnect between a lot of prior
commercial activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that people have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoying chemo bars and chemo types for a
long time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But no one was documenting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were going out of their way not to
document it, and so the robust literature
[SPEAKER_01]: that usually corresponds to a robust
commercial environment doesn't exist for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the result of that is that the
examiner looking at this didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: access to all of the commercial attitude
of record.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the commercial activity that happened
before legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in a way you think if the
examiner's tools for giving a rejection
[SPEAKER_01]: are prior publications, the examiner's
just don't have the tools to adequately
[SPEAKER_01]: examine some especially broad patent
applications relating to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dale, before you before you go further,
let me give voice to what a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: are probably thinking, which is like what
the F?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what you just described is is a mess
because there are two things that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, there were clearly chemo bars
that had more than 3% THC and 3% CBD in
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while Meersing dominant sure that
limits because Meersing is clearly the
[SPEAKER_00]: most popular terpene dominant chemo bar
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are absolutely plenty of chemo bars
that are not Meersing dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if those are your two most limiting
factors and really only need above 3% on
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and CBD and above 3% and excuse me,
and not Meersing dominant, I can hear
[SPEAKER_00]: people out there feeling like me,
like we know those exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course those existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the second part is where is the
evidence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've had to be in the underground
for all this time, or we didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: analytic labs, or people have these plants
and they have not filed them to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: timestamp on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's astonishing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like how you are approaching it
neutral and sans emotion to give us the
[SPEAKER_00]: data point, but I can, since I'm not the
attorney, I can say what the hell,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know damn well that these
plants existed, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I now understand more when I talk to
other experts, what they often will say
[SPEAKER_00]: is, ah, the USPTO didn't want to put in
the work for the research, so they granted
[SPEAKER_00]: the patent and they figured that we'll all
kick it around in court for a few decades
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it'll get sorted out,
but they didn't want to be in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what you're saying, though,
kind of lets them off the hook to me a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit until I hear what you say,
because I'm like, oh, if this stuff has to
[SPEAKER_00]: exist in a searchable form in the patent
library or in a searchable form on Google,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, hell, I might have a hard time
finding that myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I'm like, all right,
so before you continue on, what's your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on the, I don't know,
let's say the attitude of the patent and
[SPEAKER_00]: trade office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they not do their job or did they do
their job?
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we are uniquely talking about
a plant that has been prohibited,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not their fault, there's nothing,
and this is gonna have to play out in
[SPEAKER_00]: court because the prior law doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will start by saying I'm no apologist
for the patent office.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with the patent office for 23
years and there are good examiners and bad
[SPEAKER_01]: examiners at the patent office just like
there are in any organization,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if the examiners ever try to take a
shortcut or do the safe thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is to just refuse to allow a claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, in addition to my practice,
in cannabis, I've worked a lot in biotech
[SPEAKER_01]: and cancer and other things like that,
and I've certainly done battle with
[SPEAKER_01]: examiners for years trying to get some
claims to cancer treatment allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were broad claims, but the examiner
couldn't find anything that was right on
[SPEAKER_01]: point but was still very, very hesitant to
allow the claims because he didn't wanna
[SPEAKER_01]: get second guessed in the patent office
and he certainly didn't wanna have his
[SPEAKER_01]: patent associated with some ugly
litigation over its validity or associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with become kind of almost a household
topic, a dinner table topic, about how the
[SPEAKER_01]: examiner didn't do his job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my answer to people who say that
the patent office just punted on this is
[SPEAKER_01]: that notwithstanding my frustrations with
many patent examiners, they are much more
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to just say, no, than to say yes,
but they have to have some remote basis
[SPEAKER_01]: for saying no and it has to be defensible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they just don't have any literature
they can cite, they can't just have a
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling and they can't, there's a limit to
how much independent investigation they
[SPEAKER_01]: can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing they can do and that I want to
encourage the patent office to do more is
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually put the applicants on the spot
with what are called requests for
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes when a patent examiner
believes that there must be something out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that they haven't been able to find,
but that must still be out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can issue requests for information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, I was handling a plant
patent on a mango in Australia and the
[SPEAKER_01]: examiner couldn't find any evidence that
the plant itself had been commercially
[SPEAKER_01]: available, but he did find something in a
fruit cattle log that listed that the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit itself is having been commercially
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I'm putting it on you to tell
me on the record whether those trees were
[SPEAKER_01]: ever sold to anyone, were the trees ever
publicly available?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're trying to patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see evidence, this evidence gives me
enough to ask you to put it to say on the
[SPEAKER_01]: record what was actually going on,
that how did this fruit get into
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial availability?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to investigate that and we
were able to supply enough information to
[SPEAKER_01]: make it clear that while the fruit had
been available, the plants hadn't been and
[SPEAKER_01]: that mattered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go into all the details of that,
but it is up to the examiner.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any shred of indication that
something may have gone on that they just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have access to in their database,
they can force the applicant to state on
[SPEAKER_01]: the record what they know or to
characterize the historical situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what happened in this case is
there's so little about prior existence,
[SPEAKER_01]: so little published or accessible
information about prior existence of this
[SPEAKER_01]: chemotype, especially, and we should
emphasize this, especially when the
[SPEAKER_01]: examiner was looking at this, there's been
a lot of information published since then
[SPEAKER_01]: about people reacting to this patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the examiner had this in front of
him or her, they didn't even have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to issue a request for information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the future, I'm hoping that patent
examiners looking at these kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: things, what I'd really like to see is
have people be less inclined to do what
[SPEAKER_01]: people are calling the equivalent of a
land grab or a gold rush on broad patent
[SPEAKER_01]: claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have people seek claims that are more
narrowly directed to what they actually
[SPEAKER_01]: bred and created.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would also like the examiners to
feel more equipped to issue these requests
[SPEAKER_01]: for information and say, alright,
I can't find anything in the prior art,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know that there was a whole closet
industry or an underground industry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want you to tell me how you
characterize prior unpublished commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: activity in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't give the applicant a duty
to do an independent investigation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it does put them in a position where
they have to say on the record what they
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you think the patent office
asked that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they just didn't know enough about
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patent examiners probably are not the same
ones that were really familiar with a
[SPEAKER_01]: great variety of chemotypes from their own
personal use to their own personal
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't think it stood out that
that was something that was even likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: exist in this patent industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the patent examiner just
didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't have that same kind of instant
reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And didn't have a real basis for issuing
requests for information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, I will say requests for information
are pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: They usually come when you find when you
find a document that points you in a
[SPEAKER_01]: direction and just doesn't get you all the
way there to a to a valid rejection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then the examiner says I'm going to
rely on this for rejection unless you can
[SPEAKER_01]: convince me that I shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could go into a lot more detail about
this, but but basically I to answer your
[SPEAKER_01]: original question, I don't think this was
a case of the patent office taking the
[SPEAKER_01]: easy way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was them working with the tools
they had and recognizing that there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: limit to what they could do and not having
any kind of genuine legal basis for
[SPEAKER_01]: rejecting this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went ahead and allowed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other part of what you said really
is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to play itself out in the
public discourse like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they ever choose to enforce this,
this patent against an alleged infringer,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I think there will probably be all
kinds of people in the industry that will
[SPEAKER_01]: come forward and say, OK, well,
here's here's a cultivar that we can show
[SPEAKER_01]: existed prior to 2013 that has this this
chemical profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm not saying I haven't done my
own investigation, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard your reaction lots of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if that's factually accurate,
probably multiple people will come forward
[SPEAKER_01]: and defend whoever gets sued for patent
infringement and say, here's our evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: that this claim doesn't meet the novelty
requirement and therefore is not valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's really interesting that
what what they've got essentially is an
[SPEAKER_00]: overbroad patent that exists unless they
were to try to defend it, at which case
[SPEAKER_00]: everything would be put into question
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I don't know, it's odd the idea
that there's an unenforceable patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like their their best strategy may be
just to not try to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what value does it have?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very interesting legal position.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly gotten them a lot of press.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I wouldn't say it's all good press,
obviously, but I actually haven't heard
[SPEAKER_00]: any of it be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't either.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some other nuances that to
patent strategy that they did employ that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we've we've been talking about
as a very broadest claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like that broadest claim is
quite vulnerable to an attack for lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: novelty.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a series of narrower claims,
and maybe there's some narrower claim that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually would define the invention
specifically enough that it would be new
[SPEAKER_01]: and would hold up in court.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the question is, would there be
anybody out there who's infringing that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular claim?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it would be narrower and a lot
harder to infringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just, you know, that's a matter
for a matter to be sorted out when there
[SPEAKER_01]: are specific facts on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing I'll say, though,
is that this is this kind of risk of your
[SPEAKER_01]: own patents validity when you sue someone
for patent infringement is that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: standard in patent litigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with lots of clients where
before they decided whether to assert
[SPEAKER_01]: their patent, they did kind of a double
check to see what are the what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest, the most viable challenges to
validity that someone could pose for our
[SPEAKER_01]: patent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we really believe our patent is valid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we don't, we don't want to
spend millions of dollars litigating it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we don't want to come out of that
process with an invalidated patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in in the real world, in kind of
more mature established industries,
[SPEAKER_01]: people recognize that getting an overbroad
patent is mostly a waste of money because
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't enforce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least you're really risking losing
it when you enforce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, though, people pursue broad
patents in the hopes that they can become
[SPEAKER_01]: part of a licensing scheme, that they can
make it more attractive to take a somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: troublesome but not prohibitively
expensive license just as insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: against ever having to defend yourself
from from a patent infringement suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there are a lot of things
that someone can do with a patent besides
[SPEAKER_01]: winning a case in court.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am not privy to what the strategy
was behind this, but I will say that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard your reaction a lot of times as to
the novelty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I did because I got so many questions
about chemo type patents generally and
[SPEAKER_01]: about people, you know, coming up with
something that's really new and then
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to claim more than just their own
genetic developments that I did write a
[SPEAKER_01]: blog about that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go to plantlaw.com, I have a lot
of detail about what it would take to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually get a valid chemo type patent and
why it's probably a bad idea to even try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we go to our first commercial,
Dale, I know that I changed your path and
[SPEAKER_00]: took you down this rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, obviously we're not going to
cover all the all the vagaries of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biotech LLC patent today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there anything that is in your
notes where you're like, I need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: this in before we go to commercial and
come back and talk about United Cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think that pretty much covers it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just kind of sum it up to say that
it's a matter of I think everyone who
[SPEAKER_01]: dislikes this patent should almost do
their civic duty to identify whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence they're personally aware of that
would fall within the scope of these
[SPEAKER_01]: claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if this ever does get informed,
enforced and if it is as invalid as people
[SPEAKER_01]: say it is, then there will be someone who
needs help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if people in the community are
outraged by this patent, the call to
[SPEAKER_01]: action would be document what you know
that was prior to 2013 and be ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: step up and help your neighbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's that's a good call to
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's great, Dale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only is it crowd sourcing from
within our community, but it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: citizen science kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're big supporters of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of you have got evidence of
these chemovars that existed prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013, save that evidence before it is lost
to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, we're going to take our
first short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is plant scientist and patent
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis in greenhouses is taking
over the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: An efficient and effective blend of
sunshine grown terpene profiles and the
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment of indoor
greenhouses can be the best of both
[SPEAKER_00]: worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many greenhouse operators,
though, building their greenhouse before
[SPEAKER_00]: gaining insight into how cannabis
greenhouses differ from ornamental crops
[SPEAKER_00]: can be the start of a world of hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Branstad and his team at Greenhouse
Advisory Group have the experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: technical know-how to help you avoid these
pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Branstad has been helping cannabis
growers find locations, design,
[SPEAKER_00]: build and equip their greenhouses for over
a decade, first starting in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California, but expanding over the last
five years to helping clients throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has an impeccable reputation for both
depth of knowledge and kindness and
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear Eric explain some of the
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to overcome them in episode number 41
of the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where I go in the country,
good people with smart backgrounds still
[SPEAKER_00]: are making the mistake of building without
knowing cannabis, and it causes them to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn through capital and time fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has their own failure point.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some, it is improper ventilation
planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: For others, it is surface temperatures of
the building or the plant's leaves or
[SPEAKER_00]: both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks that build their greenhouse
from scratch make really basic errors like
[SPEAKER_00]: placement of the greenhouse on the
property or not understanding the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment where the greenhouse sits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have even built a decent greenhouse
but are inefficient in their deployment of
[SPEAKER_00]: light deprivation techniques and never
really hit their target yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great when you learn from your
mistakes, but it's even better when you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from the mistakes of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you bring on Greenhouse Advisory
Group, you will learn from the mistakes of
[SPEAKER_00]: their many clients and you'll take
advantage of the best practices developed
[SPEAKER_00]: by Eric Branstad over his years of working
with clients just like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: From location development to choosing a
builder and tricking out your new
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or retrofitting or rescuing
your failing greenhouse, Eric will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you through it.

more and connect with Eric and his team.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Greenhouse Advisory Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a listener of Shaping Fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: by outcompeting potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy mammoth pea near you, check out
[SPEAKER_00]: their website at www.mammothmicrobes.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partner with microorganisms to create
beautiful, thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is plant scientist
and patent attorney, Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought we were gonna get through
both of the troublesome patents in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first set, but there's a lot more to the
biotech to talk about than I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's go ahead and start wading
into the United Cannabis patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we did the biotech LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dale, if you would take us through a
general explanation so people understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the context of what we're talking about,
and then dive into the two sides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: debate so people can really grok what's
going on, that would be really
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this time we're talking about US patent
number 9730911.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone wants to Google that and pull
it up, again, it's 9730911.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a patent that was granted to
United Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Claim one is really short.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really easy to understand,
so I'll read it verbatim.
[SPEAKER_01]: A liquid cannabinoid formulation wherein
at least 95% of the total cannabinoids is
[SPEAKER_01]: tetrahydrocannabinolic acid or THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're claiming to have invented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't actually have the priority
date here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could get that before during the next
commercial break, but they're claiming to
[SPEAKER_01]: have invented.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was before about 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be the first people to have ever had a
liquid cannabinoid formulation that is at
[SPEAKER_01]: least 95% THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, in the last one we only
looked at claim one, but here it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to emphasize that they also have
independent claims five.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're following along at home,
look at claim 5, claim 10, claim 16,
[SPEAKER_01]: claim 20, and claim 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have the same phrasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A liquid cannabinoid formulation wherein
at least 95% of the total cannabinoid is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then claim one is THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Claim five is THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Claim 10 is CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Claim 16 is a combination of THCA and
CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Claim 20 is THC and CBD together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And claim 20 is CBD, CBN, and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that means is this patent
applicant went to the patent office
[SPEAKER_01]: claiming to have been the first to ever
have in their possession to have made a
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid cannabinoid formulation that was
95% of one thing as compared to all the
[SPEAKER_01]: other cannabinoids in the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what's important to understand is that
the way you interpret this claim,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't mean that it's 95% pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be any liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's any liquid that has cannabinoids in
it where 95% of the cannabinoids in it are
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing, the thing that's claimed,
and the other 5% or less is some other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's poke at that for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two things that stand out for me
are number one, would this include a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution that was 95% THCA?
[SPEAKER_00]: THC isolate and then 5% vehicle solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because that would make it 100% THC
and the claim is at least 95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not 95% of the total solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That whatever else is in the solution,
that's what makes this claim really
[SPEAKER_01]: breathtakingly broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that it doesn't matter what else is in
the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter how clean the solution
is, at least by a conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: interpretation of the claim, the plain
language of this claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is just that of the total cannabinoids,
at least 95% is whatever they call out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that clarification is huge,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at first when you were reading it,
I'm like, okay, well, my specialty is not
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm seeing tests for analytics
for DAB oils and RSOs and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, they'll float between 55 and 85
pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, 95% for an extracted oil is
pretty high in any situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that what it describes is,
oh, not the oil, how it comes out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but any fluid that 95% of the
cannabinoids are one of our target
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, that suddenly makes it from,
huh, curious to, holy crap, laughable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so strange credulity that I do
urge people to Google it and read the
[SPEAKER_01]: claim for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll read it one more time in the
context of what you just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a liquid cannabinoid formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a formulation in a liquid
state that has some cannabinoids in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A liquid cannabinoid formulation wherein
at least 95% of the total cannabinoids is
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever they call out, is THC,
THCA, CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a series of claims that claim
each one of these as a separate invention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That of the total cannabinoids is a major
phrase right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, again, I will point out that
I haven't done any chemical analysis on
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even done any literature
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I'm doing is processing the reactions
of people who have firsthand experience in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their reaction is, so far,
I'm not exaggerating to say it's uniformly
[SPEAKER_01]: what the hell or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's uniforming credulity that this claim
would be a post-2015 invention and didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: exist before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dale, I know that you roll with these
serious patent people and plant science
[SPEAKER_00]: people because I know you're talking with
them on stage and before you go on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you know what their position is on
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What their fallback is?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would they respond to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what I hear, I mean, for some
reason, maybe just because it came first
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe because it's actually into
chemotypes and people care about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about their chemotype profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still pick up a lot more upset and
outrage and stress and frustration about
[SPEAKER_01]: the biotech LLC patent family.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when people do talk about this one and
focus on this one, it's an almost mutely
[SPEAKER_01]: astonished reaction that this just can't
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm passing along their reaction to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think maybe it's that mutely
astonished either because it creates a
[SPEAKER_01]: sense of complete defeat or it creates a
sense of, okay, well, there's just no way
[SPEAKER_01]: this can stand in any just situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting about this is this
patent has been asserted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in active litigation in Colorado
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can sued a group called the Pure
Hemp Collective and sued them on the basis
[SPEAKER_01]: of some CBD formulations that they were
selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this case, I believe it was initiated
last July, give or take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, then there was a little
bit of an outcry about, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going to happen here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the court even going to hear this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the questions before this
case happened was will a federal court
[SPEAKER_01]: even permit patent litigation to proceed
if the subject matter of the patent claims
[SPEAKER_01]: overlaps with something that's federally
illegal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people thought it would just get
thrown out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are at least two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's one really good counterpoint
I've heard, which is, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some of these claims cover THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, well, like claim one and claim
five and claim 10 and so on, not claim 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: claim 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the product that was being sold
commercially was not federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a CBD product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, the people who want to
maintain hope that a federal court would
[SPEAKER_01]: never entertain patent enforcement
litigation over something that was all
[SPEAKER_01]: about THC they can still hold that hope
out because in this case, a THC product is
[SPEAKER_01]: not the accused product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a CBD product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part of it, though, is just that
I would think, you know, the argument I
[SPEAKER_01]: would make in favor of a court hearing a
case like this is, look, this is a federal
[SPEAKER_01]: agency that granted this right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a federal right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're a federal court.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do your job.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, if we're to believe
everyone that says that these claims just
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't new, the job of the court would be
to hear all the evidence and eventually to
[SPEAKER_01]: find that there's enough evidence of prior
commercial activity involving or basically
[SPEAKER_01]: prior public availability of liquid
cannabinoid formulations that fall within
[SPEAKER_01]: the scope of these claims to invalidate
the claims that were asserted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's another bit of esoterica
that is worth discussing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you sue someone for patent
infringement, you typically say that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're infringing claims X, Y and Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: You call out the specific claims that
they're that you're accusing them of
[SPEAKER_01]: infringing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have a right to petition for
declaratory judgment by the court that
[SPEAKER_01]: those claims are invalid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they they can only invalidate the
claims that are inserted asserted against
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other claims aren't aren't in play.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the outcome of this litigation,
I believe that it was just claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was claims 10 and 16 and 20
that were asserted because those are the
[SPEAKER_01]: claims that recite some amount of CBD in
the formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are the claims that would be
at risk and it could be invalidated in
[SPEAKER_01]: this litigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that wouldn't touch the other claims
that were not asserted.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking this back away from just the
generalized incredulity of whatever at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point of the show, the lips aren't
working as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we're all astonished that it was
granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, you know, if we go back
to the beginning and talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: biotech LLC issues, part of it is where is
this stuff in the historical record?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody was underground in the
medical days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things were not archived as as often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without evidence, the Patent and Trade
Office doesn't have anything to turn down
[SPEAKER_00]: a patent on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that we're going to run into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the middle of that same situation
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and the folks who have are,
you know, are having to defend themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: against these patent claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably trying to find any kind
of evidence that's out there showing
[SPEAKER_00]: preexisting art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be a really difficult
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I kind of talk about this
topic a lot at different meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I say is that I
believe that that the patent system,
[SPEAKER_01]: the utility patent system is going to have
a problem with the with the so-called
[SPEAKER_01]: presumption of validity of an issued
patent when it comes to cannabis utility
[SPEAKER_01]: patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have that problem for a
generation because it's going to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: full generation to have an academic
literature and a patent literature that is
[SPEAKER_01]: comparable, even even comparable to the
kind of academic literature and patent
[SPEAKER_01]: literature that examiners usually search
when they're looking for looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: analyze the the novelty and
non-obviousness of a claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so see, when a patent issues,
the courts treat it with the so-called
[SPEAKER_01]: presumption of validity, which just means
that they presume that the patent that the
[SPEAKER_01]: patent examination process was done
correctly and that that the patent was
[SPEAKER_01]: issued properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that presumption means is that
the defendant who's trying to invalidate
[SPEAKER_01]: the patent has a higher hurdle of evidence
to submit in order to actually get the
[SPEAKER_01]: patent invalidated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just like a 50-50, OK,
you win this coin toss.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have what is called clear and
convincing evidence of patent invalidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but I do think that this presumption
of validity, it well, it's based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: idea that the patent office did its job
and had the right tools to do its job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that when it comes to broad
cannabis utility patents, since there's
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially no prior art or no significant
prior art, it's maybe one percent or less
[SPEAKER_01]: of the prior art in other industries,
the searchable, usable prior art that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: tool of an examiner's job, that because of
that, this presumption of validity is just
[SPEAKER_01]: much, much weaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be weaker because we know that
there was in parallel with all this lack
[SPEAKER_01]: of published literature, there was a very
robust commercial activity still
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just not documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so a couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing is, is so outside of
any potential American companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: might have made these products and had
evidence of them being brought to market,
[SPEAKER_00]: how about non-U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: companies say like GW Pharma, who I would
suggest probably had such a had a thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that they had created in the lab,
but had not brought to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that play out?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that they are a British company
and not an American company and the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that they had not yet brought it to
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're asking in terms of what what their
role would be in terms of creating prior
[SPEAKER_01]: art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this with this serum that was more
than 95 percent THC and or CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that it just existed in the world
is prior art enough to unravel something
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not quite, because the prior art has
to be has to be evidence of either prior
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse me, prior public public knowledge
or prior public availability.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it has to be either be a printed
publication or on sale or somehow some
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of commercial availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if GW Pharma was publishing studies
that involved that kind of a solution in
[SPEAKER_00]: the research, that would be that would
count as public knowledge, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that's published is considered
public knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Dale, if if this is already being
litigated right now in Colorado and and
[SPEAKER_00]: these folks are trying to defend their
product against the patent claims of
[SPEAKER_00]: United Cannabis, what is the where are we
at with it right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we at with that litigation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are we starting to get a smell of how
this is going to play out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a pretty big deal for the
whole industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it really is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that happens when
someone gets sued for patent infringement
[SPEAKER_01]: is that they have a deadline to provide an
answer to the complaint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the in the answer by Pure Hemp
Collective, they listed all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: products that that were allegedly
available here or there commercially and
[SPEAKER_01]: that that already met the standard of
being ninety five plus percent CBD as part
[SPEAKER_01]: of whatever other things were present in
the liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so there are things that were
ninety nine percent CBD in a liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: formulation or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they put all that evidence into well,
they put they put assertions that such
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence existed into their answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for all that evidence to really be
considered, the case would have to go all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way to trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some things that can happen
pretrial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those things was pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sued for what is called summary
judgment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they they moved for summary judgment,
partial summary judgment as to some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: claims on the basis that what was really
being claimed was a product of nature and
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore unpatentable under Section 101,
if you remember from the previous segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was because that didn't
require any particular amount of evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really more of a question of
objective scientific fact and applying the
[SPEAKER_01]: law to that fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: The judge was able to handle that motion
without seating a jury or without going
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way into trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of some of the the evidentiary
standards and so on, there are only
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things that you can even put into
a motion like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they so they did ask the judge to
consider whether this was an unpatentable
[SPEAKER_01]: product of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after both sides made their arguments,
the patent owner, you can argue that the
[SPEAKER_01]: product of nature that comes straight out
of the plant is not a liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a soft solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people who've done res,
rosins and other kinds of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: crude extractions, you know, they can all
have their own opinion about what it is
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes out when you just what is
really present in the trichome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a liquid or is it a soft solid?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the judge considered the two the two
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the judge had found it to be a liquid,
then it would be a product of nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't even be patentable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the judge was persuaded by this by
this argument instead that rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: being an actual liquid, according to the
dictionary definition of liquids,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was more of a soft solid and therefore
what is claimed is not a product of
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been altered by human interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that was that hit the news wires
as some kind of a defeat for pure hemp and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a strengthening of you cans
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually wrote a blog about that one
as well and just said this is no big deal
[SPEAKER_01]: finding refusing to find invalidity on
this particular point is not a finding of
[SPEAKER_01]: validity of the patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a finding that that this
particular theory that could be advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: at this stage wasn't successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're likely to see is as they
get further into the the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: producing evidence and so on, if the
parties don't settle, if it actually does
[SPEAKER_01]: go to trial, then pure hemp collective
will put all this evidence in front of a
[SPEAKER_01]: jury or in front of the judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember if they've demanded a
jury trial or if this is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: the judge will handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But either way, the evidence will be
considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if if what appears to be abundant
evidence that there were plenty of liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations, there really even has to be
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there are if there is even one
liquid formulation that falls within the
[SPEAKER_01]: scope of these claims that predated the
patent, then these claims will be ruled
[SPEAKER_01]: invalid.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea that if it goes to trial is
really interesting because we have been
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing all over the cannabis industry
these big, well-funded, in capitalized
[SPEAKER_00]: behemoths in the industry coming in and
pushing on trademarks and and on product
[SPEAKER_00]: patents with these smaller players who
just simply don't have the kind of deep
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets that it takes to defend themselves
with somebody with highly paid lawyers
[SPEAKER_00]: that can go a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we seeing in the moment as far
as as the hemp folks being able to even
[SPEAKER_00]: garner the resources to present a defense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that is a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you, I've looked at the
court papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that in preparation for another talk
I was giving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked in quite a bit of detail and
they they do seem to have good
[SPEAKER_01]: representation that is doing a thorough
job of the defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they're funded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that there are people that are
coming to their defense if they need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have had litigation insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't actually know how they're
affording the defense they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if they ever seem to be
running low and need some help,
[SPEAKER_01]: there would probably be people that would
volunteer to step up and help them because
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone benefits if it is true that this
patent is overbroad and invalid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'm trying to be more objective
about that because I haven't looked at the
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it is true that there is that kind
of evidence and that this patent is
[SPEAKER_01]: invalid, then having it invalidated really
benefits everyone because then no one will
[SPEAKER_01]: be getting a letter saying, you need to
take a license to our patent or you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to stop selling your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a public benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sounds like a good reason for a
GoFundMe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long do we expect this to play out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that's going to be
kicking around for a decade or is this
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's going to be pretty
aggressive and we'll be wrapping up here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next year or two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm no litigation expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually what I do is transactions relating
to IP and helping people get patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've walked some clients through
litigation, and so I know about how
[SPEAKER_01]: litigation works from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my general sense is that different
judges set different pace, different kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of pace for the cases they handle,
and that the pace of this case will be
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat up to the judge and then somewhat
up to the time required to gather the
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence and discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the parties, if they're
negotiating some kind of a settlement,
[SPEAKER_01]: they may request some kind of a
continuance to settle the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would expect that if it goes all the
way to trial, it could drag on for another
[SPEAKER_01]: year or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that authoritatively,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just something for us to go with so that
we can all have a better understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so before we go to our second
commercial, you said something and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want to interrupt your flow a while
back, but I think it's very important to
[SPEAKER_00]: note that the fact that there is not a
rich library of cannabis information
[SPEAKER_00]: showing proof of products that have been
in the market, how long they were in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, what the packaging looked like,
what their claims on the packaging was,
[SPEAKER_00]: their analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this big void.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said something interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said this creates a sense of a lack of
knowingness that is probably going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: forward a generation as the old evidence
comes out of the shadows, wherever it may
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's not evidence in the past,
the new body of work that is happening now
[SPEAKER_00]: with decreasing prohibition as it fills in
the holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a generation later, we'll have
this stuff decided better for worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I spent most of my life as a business
strategist and that sends up huge red
[SPEAKER_00]: flags for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so many of these businesses that
are getting high level capital investment
[SPEAKER_00]: and are IPO-ing as part of their value
package, they're claiming IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this IP is not settled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this tells me is that,
I love hearing you laughing, what this
[SPEAKER_00]: tells me is that these value claims of
these companies will be in question for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while, wildly increasing the risk that
these companies need to overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I would say that it's more true
in some fields than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're claiming something that has the
technology to have been around for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time and just isn't documented,
you've got to really be suspicious about
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that patent is valid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something as technologically friendly
as, can you make a liquid formulation?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not very new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So liquid formulations have clearly been
around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes you wonder, have these
particular liquid formulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: how likely are they to be new?
[SPEAKER_01]: In other situations though, there are
really new fundamental technologies that
[SPEAKER_01]: are being applied to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very unlikely that some new,
like let's, I'm not advocating genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering, but let's talk about,
there's something called CRISPR,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a technology that lets people
edit genes in living organisms and change
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetic expression without actually
putting in any foreign genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you have a technology that's as
new as CRISPR, and you have patent claims
[SPEAKER_01]: that are directed to some new beneficial
use of cannabis that involves that,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you could safely assume that you
wouldn't need a long, old history of prior
[SPEAKER_01]: art going back a few decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: To establish whether that was patentable
or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have less of a likelihood that that
existed in a previous industry that was
[SPEAKER_01]: kept in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a function of what kind of
invention it is that would give you more
[SPEAKER_01]: or less confidence about the strength of
someone's patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just one other thing I want to
say about utility patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these two patents are so far out
there and incite such an emotional
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction, and a what the hell kind of
reaction from people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has kind of created a bad name for all
utility patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a cultivar of cannabis
that you bred yourself, and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: special and it can do some great things,
and you know you originated it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're trying to get utility
protection just so you can protect the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, because that's the only way to
protect your seeds if it's a high THC
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant patent isn't available.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant variety protection certificate
isn't available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a utility patent or nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hating on people who get utility patents
of any sort is, I think that's a gross
[SPEAKER_01]: over interpretation of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would liken these two patents to,
you know, 18 wheelers with 30 foot
[SPEAKER_01]: trailers rumbling down a school zone at 90
miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't like that, that doesn't
mean that you can't like someone riding
[SPEAKER_01]: their bike through the school zone or
driving a normal car at 25 miles an hour
[SPEAKER_01]: in the school zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because they're all motor vehicles
doesn't mean they're all doing the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't mean they all pose the same
threat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes a utility patent is the only
tool available to someone who just wants
[SPEAKER_01]: to protect what they actually created
within a normal appropriate scope that
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't overreaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because these utility patents have so
offended people in the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is, I think, a real backlash against
what I would call very appropriate and
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary utility patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm a big fan of open source
nearly everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't until I interviewed Reggie
Gaudino on an earlier episode that I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that open source is a good place
to come from in the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need these patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need good people to get patents and
exert their patents just so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: defend the heart of cannabis so it isn't
all owned by folks who don't want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: it in the same way that those of us who've
been in the family for a long time want it
[SPEAKER_00]: to be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our second
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we come back, we're going to talk
about some real brass tacks about how
[SPEAKER_00]: folks who are breeding and developing
plant lines can play a little defense
[SPEAKER_00]: against these types of patents and stick
their, you know, draw their line in their
[SPEAKER_00]: stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is plant scientist and patent
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to home growers, patients,
and commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb and Specta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his lineage and the hard earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long time heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb, also known as Inspecta and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle, is a breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_00]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were here on Vashon Island and
everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an up to date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes and custom terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes, isolated terpenes and
terpene blends are tested to the most
[SPEAKER_00]: demanding worldwide safety and stability
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes from true terpenes are third
party tested, non-GMO and food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're triple distilled, making them the
purest terpenes available in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: With over a thousand terpene isolates,
strain profiles and turp flavors,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can be sure that true terpenes will
have the perfect aromatics for your
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes also offers custom blending
so that you can match your company's
[SPEAKER_00]: marquee strains across all your product
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you can certainly simply just order
terpenes and go right to manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_00]: true terpenes also offers a wealth of
manufacturing insight, best practices and
[SPEAKER_00]: a willingness to help you break new ground
with your product formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes has robust, and supportive
customer service too, so your questions
[SPEAKER_00]: will get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've shopped for terps before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terps that you want to add
[SPEAKER_00]: to your oil or edible or capsule or
beverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose true terpenes for a top shelf
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash true
terpenes to find out more or click on the
[SPEAKER_00]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is plant scientist and patent
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney, Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dale, now that we've scared the hell
out of everybody during the first two
[SPEAKER_00]: sets, let's bring this on home,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the things that I
appreciate about chatting with you is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're constantly looking for solutions
for these challenges for breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the more I read your blogs and
talk to you about the kinds of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: interest you, I can't be the first person
to recognize that you have made a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: path from being a straight up patent
attorney to actually being a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty obvious what side of this that
you are on while remaining clear headed
[SPEAKER_00]: and neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I enjoyed talking to you the other day
about what strategies are that you
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend for people developing clone only
chemovars and seed sets to protect what
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because clearly, everybody cares a lot
more about this since the phylos mess,
[SPEAKER_00]: and people don't really have solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from show to show, we talk about
patents pretty regularly on this show,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody kind of comes to the same
point of we don't know how this is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to play out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no clean right answers because
everything is in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will hold this unique seat where
you are a plant scientist and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: patent attorney, where you can kind of see
the state of play and say, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't know how this is going to play
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best defenses that we can do today
are ABC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I want to talk about,
because a lot of folks that are listening,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're putting their life's work out into
the world, and they don't want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: scumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They especially don't want to be scumped
by people that don't have the same heart
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking specifically about plant
genetics and breeders wanting to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: their creations, what are the present best
protections available for these folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the protections is actually
free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wrote a blog about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look up on plantlaw.com and look for the
picture of grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't really remember the title of
the blog, something about protection for
[SPEAKER_01]: your IP that is free and never expires.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, it only works with one
business strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, let's suppose you have a
cultivar that you've developed and you
[SPEAKER_01]: love it and it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you either can't afford a patent or
you just don't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If all you're selling is flour and you're
never going to sell a clone, then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the challenge you have is to just
control whoever gets access to your
[SPEAKER_01]: propagating material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sell harvested material all day
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dried, it's cured, and no one can
replicate your clone from the harvested
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you control all the cloning and control
where all those clones go and who grows
[SPEAKER_01]: them, and you've got good agreements to
govern all of that, then you might not
[SPEAKER_01]: need a patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bad news of that is that even getting
those good agreements in place with people
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to cost some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's still some trust involved
and some challenges when you have to trust
[SPEAKER_01]: other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why people, even big companies
that control, and when I talk about big
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, I'm talking about my grape
clients and my blueberry clients,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't let any of their genetics out
of their hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're vertically integrated,
but they still get patents because if it
[SPEAKER_01]: does slip out, it's impossible to have a
big organization, a big operation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and still have perfect security.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything does slip out, and ends up in
the market, they need to be able to have
[SPEAKER_01]: some recourse against whoever is using
their genetics without their
[SPEAKER_01]: authorization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's not someone you made a
contract with, then you can't sue them for
[SPEAKER_01]: breach of contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless they're the ones that stole it,
and you can prove they stole it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't go after them for theft.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can always go after them for
patent infringement if they're propagating
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants without your permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can prove the patent infringement
with a DNA test.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives me an opportunity to say one
thing about DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people think you have to have a
full DNA sequence or a DNA map or
[SPEAKER_01]: something to apply for a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wrote a blog about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's titled something like
None.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how much DNA information you need
to apply for a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've obtained, counting international
ones, I've obtained thousands of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: patents from my clients, and we've never
submitted DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, on the other hand, the first time we
had to prove infringement in a really
[SPEAKER_01]: contested case with these grapes that I've
worked with, we got a DNA test right away
[SPEAKER_01]: for that because that was the way to prove
infringement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the point is that you can always go
get the DNA evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be helpful to have it in advance
because then you don't have to show a
[SPEAKER_01]: chain of custody and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say, this is the same DNA,
test that we submitted in our patent
[SPEAKER_01]: application and this accused plant matches
it completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's clearly infringing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't have to have that DNA
evidence to get the patent in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just basically do a
comparison of your patented cultivar and
[SPEAKER_01]: the accused cultivar, and the DNA will
make it open and shut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why even though people can have
a viable business, just based on
[SPEAKER_01]: agreements and on high security,
some people that have good agreements and
[SPEAKER_01]: also have high security still choose to
patent what they have because it gives
[SPEAKER_01]: them recourse, a different kind of legal
recourse against people who end up coming
[SPEAKER_01]: in and using their stuff without
permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to prove theft.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to prove a breach of
contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can prove that they don't have a
right to, that they're using your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: without your permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that is the business model that is
most easily protected, it's also like one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the least common in the scene right
now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks who are growing their own cultivar
and are the exclusive people bringing out
[SPEAKER_00]: on the market, certainly they exist,
but certainly there's a hell of a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are bringing seeds to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably going to be the bulk
of people's concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wade into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you asked about that because
that's when your choices are really
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are commercializing seeds or
selling seeds or anything except flour,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you want any kind of intellectual
property protection, you really do have to
[SPEAKER_01]: either go with a utility patent to protect
the seed, to have claims that protect the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, or if it happens to be industrial
hemp, you can go through the USDA Plant
[SPEAKER_01]: Variety Protection System.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in any of those cases, you still have
to have, you either have to exert perfect,
[SPEAKER_01]: flawless control over your plants and
what's done with them, or you have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of, some kind of contracts,
or you have to have some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property recourse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem is, you can't exercise
that flawless control over your genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole point is you're putting
them out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in this case, if you want to be
selling seeds, you're either going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: people growing those seeds without
permission, or you're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a patent on your seeds and at least
restrict, you know, they can buy your
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, they can grow your seeds,
but they can't use them for their own
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a hot button because a lot of
people really believe in the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: open source cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm someone that supports that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notwithstanding the fact that I'm a patent
attorney, I recognize that the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: itself and the community is very
passionate about sharing genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a kind of an ethic within the
industry for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those people who want to do that,
it's not for everyone, but people who want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that should be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I caused a little bit of a stir by
writing a blog that says why open source
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I definitely have a legal analysis
behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's let's let's get very
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that I am a seed maker,
and I am breeding unique cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least ones that I consider unique,
we'll have to talk whether or not they're
[SPEAKER_00]: unique legally or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to put my seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to be the only person that can
sell seeds that have gotten my name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and no one else should be able to
breed with my seed stock unless I give
[SPEAKER_00]: them permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing from the rest of the show
today that that's actually a pretty high,
[SPEAKER_00]: high level of difficulty to secure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's hear what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it doesn't have to be difficult if
you are if you're focused on if you're if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're willing to pursue a utility patent
that isn't one of these overbroad 18
[SPEAKER_01]: wheelers barreling down the school zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a it's a nice friendly Subaru or
something going 25 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an appropriate vehicle for protecting
your invention that you limit your claims
[SPEAKER_01]: to the specific cultivar that you placed
on deposit, which would be a seed sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you say I'm claiming seeds related to
these seeds, seeds that are the same
[SPEAKER_01]: progeny of the same cultivar as the seeds
that are on deposit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not claiming anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not using those just as an example of
what else as an example of something
[SPEAKER_01]: typical of my claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what I'm claiming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, that's a modest request.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a modest scope of protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only protecting the thing that you
invented, not other things, not things
[SPEAKER_01]: that other people might someday invent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do that through utility patent,
then you can you can get claims to seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that are progeny of the plant of the plant
cultivar that's on deposit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can claim a method of breeding
cannabis involving crossing one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: one of your cultivar with something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you do want to be able to
maintain that kind of exclusivity and you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to be in more of an open source
model, then then utility protection isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually it's not inaccessible and it's
not it's not an overreach.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only available way really to
protect your seeds if they have over point
[SPEAKER_01]: three percent THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if they make plants that do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand how that works downstream
from me if I was the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how does that work upstream?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, just about nothing out there
to breed with is a land race anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most breeders are not going,
you know, into these like original
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage countries and bringing back
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that let's say I'm a breeder
and I'm going to cross, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one seed that I bought from one breeder
and another seed from another breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to cross those and I'm going
to make a whole bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's say I do a sift of a
hundred of them and I find my favorite to
[SPEAKER_00]: like how far away from the original two
seeds do I need to get before I can patent
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have to do I have to do something
novel to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can I just take any two?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, can I just cross the Mac one to
anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, boom, I want to patent this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I could or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: The standard for novelty when it comes to
patents and plant genetics is really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to patent a cultivar,
you just have to show that it's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your patent claim is limited to that
cultivar, it's impossible for one cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: to be obvious over another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's legally not possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really all about the novelty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about the novelty,
really, and this sounds crazy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it really is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single seed ever formed in a cross
is new and different from every other seed
[SPEAKER_01]: genetically.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about all of the genes that
get shuffled in a sexual cross that
[SPEAKER_01]: results in seeds, there are no two that
end up being genetically identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've got all these different
phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so would it be based on the short read
of the genome instead of how it expresses
[SPEAKER_00]: itself in any particular environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm just thinking out loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm hearing here is that I can
take any two seeds, and if they are not
[SPEAKER_00]: already patented that you're not allowed
to breed with them, I can take any two
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cross them at this state of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly, I've got a novel chemovar,
and I can patent it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the blogs on plantlaw.com,
the title is, how can I tell if my strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I used the word strain there,
how can I tell if my strain is new and
[SPEAKER_01]: different enough for patenting?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my answer to that in the blog is,
if you made it, and it's a new result of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sexual cross, it's, by definition,
different and distinct enough for
[SPEAKER_01]: patenting, and you know that it's new,
the question is always going to just be,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it worth patenting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Many things that you produce are not going
to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a cross, you'll have thousands
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll grow many of those out and decide
which ones have the phenotype that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll save a small handful of
those as your special results of that
[SPEAKER_01]: cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may do some more crossing and some
more selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you finally have something that
you think is going to have commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: value for years, that's when you think
about patenting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think it's going to have
commercial value for years, then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're going to grow that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to do some back crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to try to stabilize the seed
line as much as you can, try to get it as
[SPEAKER_01]: homozygous as you can without losing all
the traits that you're after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have a stable seed line,
that's probably when that's what you would
[SPEAKER_01]: probably want to try to commercialize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably the appropriate time
to try to patent it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, you know, if you're doing
seeds, you do need to be able to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds of this particular cultivar are
substantially stable and that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: substantially true to type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if you have a
segregating population, that wouldn't even
[SPEAKER_01]: count as a cultivar per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real question of is it new,
it's new because every sexual cross is
[SPEAKER_01]: new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it distinct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even you and your sibling are different
from each other, even though you came from
[SPEAKER_01]: the same parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same with every seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But going into the future, as utility
patents on seeds become more common,
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeder is going to also have to ask,
does the original breeder of this seed
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm crossing already have an existing
utility patent on it, which would restrict
[SPEAKER_00]: me from breeding it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if they want to assert
their rights, they need to label their
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if someone is selling patented
seed, there would be a patent number on
[SPEAKER_01]: the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you'd have to respect the
utility patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't see a patent on the label,
chances are it's not patented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it is, the patent owner isn't
doing what they need to do to put the
[SPEAKER_01]: public on notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would have a defense to
infringement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if you if you later got
notice and you kept breeding, that'd be a
[SPEAKER_01]: different different problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's take that one more step
farther.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to lock down our genetics
even further, I would think that the next
[SPEAKER_00]: step would be doing, you know,
kind of a strategy like some of these seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies are where they are developing
chemovars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, no, no, they're not they're
not just clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but where they're selling seeds in
bulk to, for example, hemp folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they'll buy five thousand seeds,
but it comes with a license that you won't
[SPEAKER_00]: breed or share.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is that is kind of creating a
safety zone for those seeds, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: involving the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patent Office.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's really creating a system
where your recourse against someone who
[SPEAKER_01]: violates that is a breach of the agreement
under which you sold them the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with that is so, you know,
if I sell seeds that are restricted,
[SPEAKER_01]: I say you're allowed to use these seeds
for growing plants to grow, harvest and
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stop you from breeding with these
seeds unless unless I only sell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I sell that under terms where I say
you're not allowed to breed with these
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and your purchase of these seeds is
an acknowledgment of an agreement between
[SPEAKER_01]: us that you won't breed with these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if someone did go ahead and breed
with those seeds or did try to sell,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the second generation of those
seeds without your permission,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was all in the contract,
you'd be able to go after them for breach
[SPEAKER_01]: of contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that comes to the problem of
what about the person downstream from that
[SPEAKER_01]: agreement?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if someone else gets their hands on
those seeds and they have a defense of not
[SPEAKER_01]: being a party to that agreement,
not being aware of the agreement?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, you can you can have
agreements like a shrink wrap license in
[SPEAKER_01]: the software industry that restrict what
people do with seeds you sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unless you can show that that the
person that that accepted those terms when
[SPEAKER_01]: they bought the seeds is the person that
is violating those terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, you're not you can't sue
someone for breach of contract if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not the party to the contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that right there is such a messy
thing to have it turn on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, some of my favorite
seed companies are licensing their seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: because the material is so unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually believe they should be able
to charge to to pay for the research and
[SPEAKER_00]: the significant part of their life that
they put into developing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can really only enforce it
against the people they had the licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody they had a license with gave
it to a friend, surreptitiously,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can only sue the person they had the
license with, not their friend that took
[SPEAKER_00]: it and crossed it with something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I would call that a big gaping
hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's why people choose to
plug that hole with a patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, one of my sayings I use a
lot is if you're a hammer, everything
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like a nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a patent attorney,
you can fall into the trap of thinking the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution to every problem is a patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to sound like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I try to learn what people want to
accomplish and then help them accomplish
[SPEAKER_01]: that in a way that's most consistent with
their needs and their goals and their
[SPEAKER_01]: budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't always recommend patent
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're working with biological
organisms that that self reproduce and
[SPEAKER_01]: that are so easy to reproduce in large
quantities, if you're if you're free to do
[SPEAKER_01]: so, not having some kind of a backstop of
intellectual property rights just means
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've got to have much tighter
control in other aspects of your business
[SPEAKER_01]: plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just no no other way around it
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm advocating a new system that would
change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but the current system just doesn't it
doesn't give you recourse against anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: who's not a party to the agreements that
you made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that you mentioned your new
system, because this is where I want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do you go there,
we have talked a lot of vagaries back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just would like your bulleted action
points for somebody who is listening and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are breeding their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best thing that they can do
right now to protect themselves as this
[SPEAKER_00]: evolves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give me the short version so so that
they can write it down and have a task
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing is to make sure you're you're
selling your seeds with some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictions on the label and that you
make that sale as conditional as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to sell only to trustworthy parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't do that, and you value
those seeds and you think they'll have
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial value for a long time,
the bad news is you really do need a
[SPEAKER_01]: patent and it needs to be a utility
patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and I think that that probably
describes just about everybody in the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what are the next steps they take
to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me just let me just amend that if
if it's industrial hemp, then you have two
[SPEAKER_01]: options.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got utility patent or plant variety
protection certificate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some reasons not to do PVP,
including that there's an express
[SPEAKER_01]: exemption that permits people to breed
with the seeds that they obtain that are
[SPEAKER_01]: protected that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it still goes back to utility patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The steps are, if you want a utility
patent, make sure that you that you get an
[SPEAKER_01]: application filed within a year of the
first the first public availability of the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds or any part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to move relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you're working with someone
that knows what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out how many plant patents they've
filed before or not even plant patents,
[SPEAKER_01]: but utility patents relating to plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just just make sure that
you are getting what you pay for when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to getting the legal advice that you
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so so let's talk about this new idea
that you've put together for a new
[SPEAKER_00]: spirited international convention that
would protect nearly all the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants, because it certainly got me
excited listening to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like a really great way for
to bring everybody together for the good
[SPEAKER_00]: of the availability of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it feels a lot like open
source the more you and I talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so go ahead and give us the the
elevator speech, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have been an advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been sympathetic, at least to open
source, and I advocate its use for people
[SPEAKER_01]: who want to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem, the biggest problem with
open source in plant genetics is its
[SPEAKER_01]: contrast with or is demonstrated by
contrasting it with with computer
[SPEAKER_01]: software.
[SPEAKER_01]: Software open source works because
software has an automatic copyright.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moment it's created, you don't have to
apply for a copyright.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with open source and plant
genetics is that there is no automatic
[SPEAKER_01]: right that exists upon creating a new
genetic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to go apply for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the analogy between open source
software and open source plant genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks down at this point where copyright
infringement is a form of recourse you can
[SPEAKER_01]: use against someone who never agreed to
your the conditions of your open source
[SPEAKER_01]: software situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you create an open source seed
sharing or genetic sharing community and
[SPEAKER_01]: someone is outside that agreement and you
don't have underlying IP rights to assert
[SPEAKER_01]: against them, you don't have anything to
assert against them because you can't go
[SPEAKER_01]: after them for breaching your agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't a party to your agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm advocating is a form of
plant breeder's right that is very similar
[SPEAKER_01]: to a copyright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copyrights exist upon creation of an
original work because there was an
[SPEAKER_01]: international convention, or there still
is, called the Berne Convention that was
[SPEAKER_01]: established in 1896 or 1886, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the US, I don't remember, 86,
96, whatever, but the US joined it 102
[SPEAKER_01]: years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as of that date, copyrights in the
US were automatically protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 86 and 88.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 1988, the US finally joined the
Berne Convention and copyrights became
[SPEAKER_01]: automatically protectable as soon as you
created an original work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what I'm advocating is something very
much like the Berne Convention for plant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders so that when you create an
original cross and you make a selection
[SPEAKER_01]: and you establish a cultivar, that you
don't have to apply for any form of
[SPEAKER_01]: protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there like a copyright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone who violates that by illicitly
obtaining and propagating your genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: selection would be in violation just the
same as someone who illicitly obtained
[SPEAKER_01]: some software code and commercialized
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm advocating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take some work, but I think
there are enough people who would benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: from this and enough people who care about
it that I don't intend for this just to be
[SPEAKER_01]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if every single seed is unique and
you're talking about giving everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's plant breeding default protection,
how does that drill down to the uniqueness
[SPEAKER_00]: of every individual seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you read the blog that I wrote
about open source, one of the headings is,
[SPEAKER_01]: my dad is such a pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: LOL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the reason that's relevant is that
anything we ever write, anything we ever
[SPEAKER_01]: write that is original is protected by
copyright.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't mean we commercialize.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do anything with most of those
copyrights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every email you've written today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my example in the blog is everything
my kids text on their phones practically
[SPEAKER_01]: is copyright protected unless it's
completely unoriginal, like my dad is such
[SPEAKER_01]: a pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: LOL.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not original enough to qualify for
copyright because my kids were not the
[SPEAKER_01]: first ones to type that in a text,
even if they type it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point is that there's more
copyright protected material out there in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world that's being created every
second than anyone is ever going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: anything with in terms of asserting their
legal rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact that that protection is
automatic gives you all kinds of latitude
[SPEAKER_01]: if you write a blog or if you write
software.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever kind of creation you do,
whatever kind of creative activity that is
[SPEAKER_01]: protectable by copyright, you've got that
just by having created it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by analogy, if you think about all the
text that people write, that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: analogous to all the diversity that is in
a single batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of those seeds would be
protectable, would be under basically the
[SPEAKER_01]: basic breeder's rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they choose to do with that is
another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many things do we have that are
copyright protected that we never care to
[SPEAKER_01]: assert our rights over?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if something in there is really
valuable, the difference between a text
[SPEAKER_01]: that you send and a book that you write,
then you're going to have some rights that
[SPEAKER_01]: you do care to assert, but you still don't
have to go apply for those rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's extend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's apply that to an open source system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If every breeder that puts something into
an open source system already had a right,
[SPEAKER_01]: to assert against someone who used their
genetics without permission, then an open
[SPEAKER_01]: source system would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because within the system, you'd say,
alright, we're going to share seeds under
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all got rights under these seeds,
but we're going to share them under
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions that you will do this and that,
and you won't do this other thing with
[SPEAKER_01]: these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or that if you do this other thing,
let's say if you commercialize something
[SPEAKER_01]: that was derived from these genetics,
that you have to pay something back into a
[SPEAKER_01]: fund that protects everyone from patent
infringement litigation or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can put conditions on the use of
those seeds, and if everyone had
[SPEAKER_01]: protection of their genetic varieties that
was automatic, then anyone who illicitly
[SPEAKER_01]: obtained those seeds and did something
that was outside the open source system,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd have recourse against them,
just like people have recourse against a
[SPEAKER_01]: copyright infringer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it plugs the hole that exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about the fact that you can't
sue someone for breach of contract if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not a party to that contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can sue someone for breach of an
intellectual property right without ever
[SPEAKER_01]: having a contract with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really interesting and engaging
idea, the fact that if every seed that is
[SPEAKER_00]: bred is automatically protected,
it opens us up to be able to more casually
[SPEAKER_00]: share the seeds with other seed makers
because we don't really have to worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about what they're doing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it reminds me of that old phrase,
fences make good neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like if everybody who's
breeding already has got protections for
[SPEAKER_00]: their stuff, but people generally don't
mind if other people are breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: their seeds as well, then everybody kind
of is on equal footing, which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: what most breeders want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most breeders just don't want
their work usurped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: People recoil at the notion of having
everything just dripping with intellectual
[SPEAKER_01]: property because it's new to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like that's just overkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real overkill, the real problem is
the difficulty and expense of getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once you have it, you're free to
do whatever you want with it, including
[SPEAKER_01]: just leave it there and not assert it at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not troubled by the automatic nature
of copyright protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that plant breeding is at
least as much a creative activity as
[SPEAKER_01]: writing is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly not all plant breeding results
are created equal and not all writing is
[SPEAKER_01]: created equal, but it's all protected by
copyright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it hasn't made planes fall out of the
sky and disaster happen all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit foreign.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a way, it's counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like you said, all of these rights
that everyone have has would actually make
[SPEAKER_01]: it safer and easier to share what we have
because it would give us a way to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: sift between the people who are willing to
play by some basic rules of respect and
[SPEAKER_01]: trustworthiness and still have some
recourse against people who aren't willing
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone who comes in and takes what you've
got and then commercializes it and does
[SPEAKER_01]: something you don't approve of or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have some recourse against
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see one more big challenge to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, of course, being this,
you know, keeping it in balance,
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting myself while wanting to share
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like your answer to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we've seen time and time again,
well-funded folks are just pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: low-funded folks to go to settlement and
not really getting their day in court just
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because they can outspend them
legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would a small person in your or
underfinanced person in your system defend
[SPEAKER_00]: their automatic patent on their seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that kind of depends on if they're
trying to assert their rights against
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who is using their seeds without
permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a challenge because you face
different challenges when you're assessing
[SPEAKER_01]: your rights than when someone is asserting
their rights against you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you've got to fund the
litigation up front.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the abuse is bad enough,
then you may be able to recover damages.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I've advocated in addition
to this open source system, which is more
[SPEAKER_01]: about defending against abusive patent
suits, defending people who are sued for
[SPEAKER_01]: infringing an abusive patent is a system
of mutual defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is about defending against being
sued for an abusive, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: an abusive overbroad patent that the
community has already come to the
[SPEAKER_01]: conclusion that is invalid and should be
fought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do advocate in a blog that I wrote
called Standing Up to Big Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: A mutual defense approach where it's kind
of like NATO.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you sue any of our members,
we're going to band together and use all
[SPEAKER_01]: of our patents to see if there's any of
our patents that we own that we could
[SPEAKER_01]: counter sue against you for infringing our
patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's better described in the blog than
we have time for in this situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, it's a mutual defense
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are actually I don't like to just
write about things and not put them into
[SPEAKER_01]: action.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am trying to form some kind of a
coalition of united small cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and individual breeders that can
create that kind of mutual defense in the
[SPEAKER_01]: event that one of them gets sued for
patent infringement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to put together a mutual
offensive approach just because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: harder to insure against.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder for it to get insurance for
that kind of outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it could still happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think depending on how you fund the
open source system, you know, if the open
[SPEAKER_01]: source system has some kind of fund that
people who infringe it have to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if let's say the damages that
come from an infringement of an open
[SPEAKER_01]: source system, if those damages went into
a fund that could then be used to further
[SPEAKER_01]: assert the rights against, you know,
just the people who violate the system,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a pretty sensible thing to do with
with proceeds from an open source fund.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are really two different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mutual defense against offense against
being sued for infringement of an
[SPEAKER_01]: overbroad utility patent is kind of a
separate institution, separate animal from
[SPEAKER_01]: the open source and open automatic rights
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please allow me to distill this down to
see if I've got this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so what you're proposing is kind of
like this this this two part one,
[SPEAKER_00]: two punch thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that we need to do is to
set up an international convention so that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a default setting that when
breeders and it sounds like you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we're talking about cannabis,
where where cannabis breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment they make the cross and they
have resultant seeds, those are by default
[SPEAKER_00]: defended by a patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that creates the protections that
most everybody is needing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your second is let's pull these
newly protected breeders together into
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of cannabis breeders union and
and call ourselves an organization and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of yearly fee that will go to
litigation insurance so that if any one of
[SPEAKER_00]: us is having to defend ourselves,
we are able to turn on the turn to the
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance policy so that all of all of we
lesser funded cannabis folks are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: represent ourselves the same way that
NATO.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one country gets attacked, everybody
comes to their defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that my close That's pretty close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just I would correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just amend one thing that you said
about, you know, the automatic protection
[SPEAKER_01]: for plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be a patent because patents
get applied for and they get examined and
[SPEAKER_01]: they have certain rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be more like a copyright that is
that that is automatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically just a prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something you can write claims
for and that you that you copyrights are
[SPEAKER_01]: inherently available, but they're they're
not as I'd say they're not as usually
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated or strong as patent rights per
se.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm advocating for is a really
basic breeder's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that gives you some recourse against
someone who would infringe your your
[SPEAKER_01]: rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you'd have to do is just show that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is your this is your your your
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your the result of your breeding and that
someone has someone's taken it that the
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA matches and therefore you have a right
to stop them from from making further use
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way, that would be very similar to a
patent, but it would just be I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd want to use the term patent because
that implies that it's gone through this
[SPEAKER_01]: whole process of that's where I was going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really a patent or a
copyright.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a patent, but it's kind of like
a patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not and it's and it's kind of
like copyright, but it's not a copyright.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some third thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm advocating the creation of a
patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The creation of a natural plant breeder's
right to the selections and you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses and the selections that that
breeder makes that would be equivalent to
[SPEAKER_01]: a copyright.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be the same as a patent,
but it would give the breeder the right to
[SPEAKER_01]: control what people do with that
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the same as a as a writer has the
right to control what people do with his
[SPEAKER_01]: or her written work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as as you roll this out and you
and you start to make this real,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to find yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new vocabulary right because patent the
word is not only not what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's packed with all of these
expectations and and such from people and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's also not copyright and it's also
not open source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're creating is an animal
that we have not seen in cannabis so far
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think I think that you need some new
vocabulary man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we do and and but the whole reason
to do this is to facilitate open source.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to make it so that you can have
recourse against people who are not
[SPEAKER_01]: parties to your open source agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're if they're violating your open
source terms without ever having agreed to
[SPEAKER_01]: them, it gives you a recourse just like
people have a recourse against copyright
[SPEAKER_01]: infringers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole point of it, and there
may be some other things that people could
[SPEAKER_01]: do with it, but the main.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I came up with this idea is
that it would.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would make open source workable and I
want to see open source be workable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's explained in more detail in
the blog that I wrote about that and then
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of the mutual defense fund.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is it would be really a group that
purchases some kind of group litigation
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done some preliminary pricing on this
and I I don't have a strong enough
[SPEAKER_01]: commitment on the pricing to be able to
quote it or anything, but the idea would
[SPEAKER_01]: be that yes, you have a coalition that
forms an organization that buys this group
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance and that the group insurance
covers people who get sued for patent
[SPEAKER_01]: infringement so that they have just as big
a patent and patent litigation war chest
[SPEAKER_01]: as the people who are suing them so that
the size disparity goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also a mutual commitment
by members of this organization that if
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a patent that this other that
this that this opponent is is infringing
[SPEAKER_01]: that the defendant can use this other
organization members patent against them
[SPEAKER_01]: just and it is in a way analogous to NATO
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you point your guns at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody on my teams guns point back at
you and so we hopefully don't shoot each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decide to find a way to settle our
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously this would need to be
administered by some kind of a nonprofit
[SPEAKER_01]: and but I think that once once we had an
idea of how many members were interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in that and what the insurance rates would
be, then you basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charge a fee that covers that plus maybe
the cost of one administrator and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a mutual defense that's workable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It it it's not something that I that I
would advocate doing on a for profit basis
[SPEAKER_01]: just because we have so many trust issues
in this industry already.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone thought this was just a scheme
to make money, I don't think people would
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be part of it, but if we see that
see it as an answer to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The balance that the imbalance of power
between big cannabis or big ag and a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of small cannabis people who still want to
be able to stay in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to have to consolidate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to have to sell to a big
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be able to stand and and and
do what they're doing and and not not be
[SPEAKER_01]: at the mercy of this huge imbalance of
power that the way to do that would be to
[SPEAKER_01]: form a coalition that actually has teeth
in it that can provide a mutual defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the event that some of these overbroad
patents get asserted against one member of
[SPEAKER_01]: the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dale, just because I know you a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that this is actually kind of a
activist kind of heart taking thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're taking on and yet most of the
listeners, including me, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we're stoners who know about pipe
dreams, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what can you tell us that that
would encourage people to pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing or think that this is
reasonable that this has come together
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of just being a really great story
to tell over a bowl?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the the the answer always
has to be watch what people do and not
[SPEAKER_01]: just what they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do cut them some slack in terms of getting
things done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not sure whether they're
real or not, talk to them and offer to
[SPEAKER_01]: help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know if someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If if someone thinks that I'm floating
these ideas just for fun or just to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give people kind of a like a temporary
pipe dream or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to me, reach out to me, ask how you
can help because I I do want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to turn these things into
action.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have become a bit of an activist,
even though I still run a law firm and
[SPEAKER_01]: have to pay bills and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what I do and care about the most
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really tied to anything that I can
bill anybody for in my law firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to see things work well enough
that everybody in this industry prospers
[SPEAKER_01]: and achieves their their goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Dale, this has been great and I
really appreciate meeting an attorney who
[SPEAKER_00]: I find both personable or divine
personable, skilled and on my side and
[SPEAKER_00]: usually I don't get all three in the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so thank you very much for for spending
your valuable time with us helping us get
[SPEAKER_00]: to the bottom of these two biotech and
United Cannabis patents that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about a lot, but didn't really
understand very well and kind of bring
[SPEAKER_00]: this up to the state of the art or the
state of play of where cannabis patents
[SPEAKER_00]: are today, because we really just want to
protect ourselves and it sounds like our
[SPEAKER_00]: best play is going to be to continually
work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've I'm pretty sure that we're going
to have you back on again because this has
[SPEAKER_00]: been great to hear your experience and put
so succinctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a lot, Dale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
