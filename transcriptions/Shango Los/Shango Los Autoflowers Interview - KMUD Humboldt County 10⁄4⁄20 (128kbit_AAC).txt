[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to introduce our guest and let
our listeners know who we're having this
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunday?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually really excited about this
guest this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have Shango Lose on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the host of a podcast called Shaping
Fire, which is all about the science and
[SPEAKER_01]: some technology as well as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually was not a fan of podcasts
previously because it kind of was the age
[SPEAKER_01]: of this American life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they were good, but
sometimes they weren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just kind of like, eh,
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not super interested in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somehow heard about Shango Lose's
Shaping Fire podcast and started listening
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just absolutely mind blown by
the guests he had, their level of
[SPEAKER_01]: expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a phenomenal interviewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of, it changed my world
from like, I don't really like podcasts to
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring out that there was this
incredibly diverse world of wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts and podcast representatives out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm super excited to have him on this
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is up in Vashon Island, which is up in
the far reaches of the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's going to be talking to us today
about autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that most of us who have been in
this industry for a while, like pre-64 and
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely pre-215, we probably have
experienced autoflowers as a ruderalis
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, which was not very much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just weren't very good genetics
and they were just weird plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So things have really changed from back
then to where they are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And autoflowers are actually getting a
really good rep, especially in places like
[SPEAKER_01]: the far Pacific Northwest, where you have
such a short growing season, you really
[SPEAKER_01]: can't grow a lot of the same cultivars
that we do down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's going to be talking to us about
all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And any other little tricks you might have
for growing up there in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_02]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Shango.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey there, Wendy and Sunshine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate you taking some time
out to talk with us today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've enjoyed your little conversation that
you were having about smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have been experiencing smoke up here as
well on Vashon Island in Washington State,
[SPEAKER_04]: where I live.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that people are very
aware of here is that old smoke and old
[SPEAKER_04]: soot doesn't have a smell to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know all about how terpenes volatilize
off cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so over time, cannabis smells less and
less aromatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually the same thing for smoke
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over time, the aspects of it that we smell
from the burnt natural material and
[SPEAKER_04]: chemicals, eventually those terpenes
volatilize and go away as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so just because our flowers don't
smell like smoke doesn't mean that we
[SPEAKER_04]: shouldn't be aware that they very well may
have soot-related toxins in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very sticky wicket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sticky wicket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering, too, there's been a lot of
talk this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Shango, if you've heard of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was somewhat new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, it's not really because I
tried it once a long time ago and was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, heck no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a water curing process that
you can use where you are literally
[SPEAKER_01]: submerging your flower into water and then
changing that water out every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wicks off basically like it,
you know, utilizes all the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets that all off and it also removes
many of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you end up with a very smooth smoke,
but there's not a lot of flavor or nose to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wonder if for small home grows that
really are concerned, that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: something they could try.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, I recall kind of doing it
a long time ago once and being like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, heck no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way too much work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only tried that once before with one
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, being a host of a podcast I try
to try everything once, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I tried it once and I found that
the plant material started to degrade.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so every time I was taking it out of
the water, I was losing plant material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't really care for that part of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for most of the people that I work
with who are home growers, I don't have as
[SPEAKER_04]: much to do with commercial growers,
you know, as far as being hands on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I live on Bachelon Island where most of
our growers are our outdoor patients and
[SPEAKER_04]: folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so most of the folks were just shaking
their plants and blowing the soot off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so most of the patients are not having
the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the problems that we're having are
folks in eastern Washington and of course
[SPEAKER_04]: down in Oregon who have got a large number
of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure what their their
solutions are going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one one interesting thing to
note as far as the water curing,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's actually very common in eastern
Washington where it's very, very dry and
[SPEAKER_04]: very dusty to harvest their plants,
hang them upside down like you would a
[SPEAKER_04]: side of beef or something and spray them
with the hose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the water just cascades off of
the plant into this big muddy,
[SPEAKER_04]: muddy pool below it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then because the air is so incredibly
dry there, the plants just just dry with
[SPEAKER_04]: some fans and there you have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people that's not going to be a good
option.
[SPEAKER_04]: For them, though, simply because living in
the Pacific Northwest, if you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: get your whole plant wet, including the
flower, you are looking for mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the southern edge of that Pacific
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I consider us to be Pacific Northwest,
like the very southern part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all of us who live in rainforests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, we've definitely, you know,
like I said, we've we've played with the
[SPEAKER_01]: bud washing technique previously and we
found that it just that the oxidation that
[SPEAKER_01]: occurred was so rapid, it was really kind
of hard to get around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if that was because of
the vinegar and baking soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you moved it to a hydrogen
peroxide and then you moved it to a plain
[SPEAKER_01]: water rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was a decent amount of
product we were moving through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started moving through it rather
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like maybe we didn't rinse it
extremely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's going to be
interesting to see when testing starts
[SPEAKER_01]: coming through as to what this is going to
look like for commercial cultivators in
[SPEAKER_01]: California, especially with our testing
that requires less than 25 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination for foreign particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that's 25 percent of
the entire bud, 25 percent of the buds
[SPEAKER_01]: have something on them or what might be
the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Processors are definitely going to have
their hands full this fall and winter,
[SPEAKER_01]: though, for certain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't thought about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: About the content.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing for sure, one thing for sure,
they're going to be getting smoky packs on
[SPEAKER_04]: the East Coast for the unlicensed market,
no doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably already are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, we're we're getting almost
close to the top of the hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already, which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we just started conversing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But real quick, do you want to kind of
talk a little tiny moment here about some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the auto?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're you're a big proponent of
the auto flower, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big proponent of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not something for every
single grower, but it is definitely a good
[SPEAKER_04]: plant for a large swath of of the,
you know, the total number of people who
[SPEAKER_04]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want me to see into that,
I would be happy to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's let's do that at the top of
the hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go into that some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I'd be curious to learn
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that I've learned about one
thing I've learned from teaching about
[SPEAKER_04]: auto flowers, primarily to patients for
the last few years, is one of the things
[SPEAKER_04]: I've learned is what I've learned from
folks down in your area, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's a lot of resistance to
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the traditional heritage growers
right off the bat, because generally
[SPEAKER_04]: speaking, while there are some larger
cultivars of auto flowers, most of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants are smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: They they they top out somewhere between
three and five feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a little thinner in yield and bud
structure, though the terpene profiles are
[SPEAKER_04]: often incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of good terpene profiles
on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, folks really love those monster
trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and I talk to folks who are heritage
growers and they're like, listen,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, everybody loves a beautiful
tree, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, especially down where you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all love the redwoods.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the things that really brought
large trees, cannabis plants to prominence
[SPEAKER_04]: was the 99 plant maximum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because suddenly, if you only were allowed
to run 99 plants legally, each one of
[SPEAKER_04]: those plants had to just be incredible and
huge because you were limited in number.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that really added a lot to the
mystique of the big plant beyond just the
[SPEAKER_04]: sheer beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the the people who most quickly
embrace auto flowers are people who are
[SPEAKER_04]: not as concerned about the 99 plant
minimum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the four categories of those people
tend to be number one, first and foremost,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the folks that, you know, I'm most
active teaching auto flowers to which is
[SPEAKER_04]: patience, because, you know, while large
plants are certainly sexy, they are
[SPEAKER_04]: challenging for many patients who may have
mobility issues or space issues or or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, an ability to break them down
and and and work the plant themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of us, when we're harvesting those
big plants, we're on ladders, we're using
[SPEAKER_04]: multiple people sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is just not something for
patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so right off the bat, auto flowers
were something that were embraced by
[SPEAKER_04]: patients because they were they were a
smaller commitment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got, you know, high cannabinoid
profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: They smell good.
[SPEAKER_04]: They give a sense of success.
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably most importantly,
they give a sense of self being able to
[SPEAKER_04]: take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being being self self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what I'm trying to get to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's important for patients who are
used to depending on caregivers and
[SPEAKER_04]: doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and, you know, very often they're also
depending on food banks and things like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to have a plant that you can grow
yourself and harvest yourself and make
[SPEAKER_04]: your own medicine is is a fantastic win.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so that's the first group of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second group of people are home
growers who are perhaps growing indoors
[SPEAKER_04]: where having a monster plant is not
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, they may be growing in a tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so some of the challenges with regular
seeds is that, you know, they can often
[SPEAKER_04]: outgrow the tent if you're not on top of,
you know, keeping them topped and trimmed
[SPEAKER_04]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with auto flowers, they really fit a
four by four, you know, by 70 inch tent
[SPEAKER_04]: really well where you don't have to top
them at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes them very convenient for an
indoor tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also a lot of home growers also need
to use a certain amount of discretion when
[SPEAKER_04]: they are at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I recognize that, you know,
where you live, you have a a personal
[SPEAKER_04]: plant minimum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people don't really have to hide them
as much unless they are concerned with
[SPEAKER_04]: their neighbors swiping them or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here in Washington and for most of the
rest of the country, you still need to
[SPEAKER_04]: hide your plants because we don't have a
legal number of plants that you can grow
[SPEAKER_04]: in Washington without a medical card.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's still how most of the country
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for people who still need to tuck
their cannabis plants in between their
[SPEAKER_04]: tomatoes and their corn in their garden,
auto flowers are a really fantastic option
[SPEAKER_04]: because there's a lot of bang for their
buck and and they tend to grow out
[SPEAKER_04]: horizontally instead of just upwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and and many of them have got the you
know, typically they don't look as much
[SPEAKER_04]: like cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the leaves are the sun leaves are
still recognizable.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the plants themselves, many of them
don't have the traditional structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so so that's the second category is
homeowners.
[SPEAKER_04]: The third or fourth category is commercial
THC growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is something that I have found
more and more commercial growers down in
[SPEAKER_04]: California reaching out to me to talk
about this because they've realized that
[SPEAKER_04]: right in the summertime, a dearth of
cannabis, you know, that that July,
[SPEAKER_04]: August time when when all last year's
outdoors is long gone, there is some
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor around.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, everybody's getting ready for
depths to harvest and then and then full
[SPEAKER_04]: terms to harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those growers who are looking to make
money midsummer are starting to grow auto
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers because if they if they start them
June 1st, they're ready to harvest
[SPEAKER_04]: September 1st.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if and if you happen to live in a bio
region in, you know, in the in the Emerald
[SPEAKER_04]: Triangle area where you get warmer in May,
you can certainly start them as early as
[SPEAKER_04]: May 1st.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then oh, my gosh, you're done August
1st and you're bringing fresh flowers to
[SPEAKER_04]: the market at a time when not a lot of
people have them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you get people growing them either
to move into the flower market.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but honestly, most of the people who
I've talked to in your area who have been
[SPEAKER_04]: trying them, they're growing them to put
into the extraction market so that they
[SPEAKER_04]: can bring fresh flowers with unique herbs
and and they you know, and they've got
[SPEAKER_04]: them in in August.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I want to do a follow up on the
extraction, but we do need to take care of
[SPEAKER_02]: our top of the hour business.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I'll hang tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, OK, hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been Sunshine Johnson.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're with Wendy Kornberg and we were
here with Shingo and we are talking
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis here on The Ganja Tree Show VR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to take you guys down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not much to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to The Ganja Tree right
here on Redwood Community Radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM and HD1.
[SPEAKER_00]: KMU Eureka, 88.1 and HD1.
[SPEAKER_00]: KLAI Leightonville at 90.3 FM and Shelter
Cove at 99.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere on the web at KMUD.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a couple of minutes past two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to bring you right back to Ganja
Tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Shingo, I have a question about the
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say I'm a little bit adverse to it
because it just just comes across as kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of commercial to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's going to have the
nuances and the flavors and aromas that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there's a good hash strain,
I'd be I'd be interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of the interesting things is,
you know, I'd actually say the majority of
[SPEAKER_04]: them are good hash strains for one
particular reason, which is a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people talk trash about auto flowers
because they don't necessarily have the
[SPEAKER_04]: tightness of a rock hard indica flower
like you get growing in there in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Humboldt region.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for most of the rest of us in the
country, our flowers don't finish like
[SPEAKER_04]: that anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're used to growing flowers that are
more open and and auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_04]: since they are, you know, whatever,
you know, whatever traditional cultivar
[SPEAKER_04]: that we like to grow crossed into a
ruderalis, ruderalis flowers are typically
[SPEAKER_04]: very much more open.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they give up their trichomes much
more reasonably than trying to work with
[SPEAKER_04]: really rock hard buds, which are which are
great for bag appeal and are sexy to
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to get them to open up during the
hashing process has got some amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: challenges and you're always going to lose
trichomes on the inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas auto flowers, so long as you find
something with a taste profile you like,
[SPEAKER_04]: and certainly you want to make sure
they've got fragile trichomes in that
[SPEAKER_04]: particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're just about all open flowered,
which is why a lot of people look at auto
[SPEAKER_04]: flower and say, oh, I don't want to grow
these don't these don't have good bag
[SPEAKER_04]: appeal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they only have, you know,
questionable bag appeal if you are from
[SPEAKER_04]: where you live and all the flowers that
you grow are gorgeous and are,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, magazines spread quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you live in a place where,
you know, that is unique in our country
[SPEAKER_04]: and in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for just about everybody else,
the tightness of the flower that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: get in California or indoor anywhere,
a lot of people are just really glad to
[SPEAKER_04]: have good smelling plant with
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say that certainly auto flowers
are great for hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of the people that I know who are
home growers and enjoy making ice water
[SPEAKER_04]: hash themselves, they grow their auto
flower group of plants intentionally to
[SPEAKER_04]: make hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so maybe they'll maybe they'll have
some full terms for smoke and to take to
[SPEAKER_04]: parties because they look sexy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then the hash that they're making is
from the auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one of my favorite auto flower
hash making cultivars is actually from
[SPEAKER_04]: Daniel at at Heart Rock Mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got this fantastic cultivar called
lion claw.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's you know, it's got all the full
flavor that you were saying that you were
[SPEAKER_04]: concerned about missing from a full term
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because it's got that tang you get
from alcohol esters that a lot of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the early auto flowers didn't
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were looking for complexity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lion claw from from Heart Rock
Mountain, this is the first one that I
[SPEAKER_04]: came across where I got a reliable six
foot plant had the full flavor that had
[SPEAKER_04]: great bud shape.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that looked kind of like a Northern
Lights five plant traditionally looks
[SPEAKER_04]: like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and they're really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing about is, is you got to grow a
lot of them, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've probably been involved with like,
I don't know, growing 80, 85 different
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and there were a lot of losers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no question about it that there
were a lot of them that were just kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: mediocre.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you got to remember, like,
we're not we're not in the same situation
[SPEAKER_04]: we were 10 years ago, where auto flowers
didn't produce and they smelled like crap
[SPEAKER_04]: and they didn't smoke very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're 10 years later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while they might not be the same as
the like epic genetics that come out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the Humboldt, you know, and the Emerald
Triangle area.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a this is a game that's just
getting started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as more and more of the solid heritage
growers start to move into auto flowers
[SPEAKER_04]: because of how useful they are,
I think that we're going to find the
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene profiles getting more along the
lines of what you expect from from a photo
[SPEAKER_04]: period.
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't think that the auto flowers
don't smell good if you're growing an auto
[SPEAKER_04]: flower and it doesn't smell good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just means that you've got the wrong
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so how do you really mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that part of part of the problems
that a lot of people have with the auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers on the commercial market is
they're not in that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: California has got this whole idea that
you need to be above 20 percent THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: the autos that I've seen the testing on
them, they're not coming back anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: close to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The closest I've seen was a high somewhere
in the high teens for total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think THC was resting around 14
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe for hash that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even the hash makers that I know don't
really want to mess with something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that low in THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if California commercial
market is quite there yet with its ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to embrace the auto flower as it exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do love the idea of breeding it and
starting to, you know, taking those
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding projects and dialing them in
after a few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of growers in your
area that gave them a try this year.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, I'm familiar with the
food folks at Moon Time Medicinals there
[SPEAKER_04]: in Garberville.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've got this beautiful hugelkultur
that they have uncovered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if they run their full terms there,
they do catch a cough and catch some
[SPEAKER_04]: weather at the end of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this year they grew what,
six hundred square feet, no, six thousand
[SPEAKER_04]: square feet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, a huge ass, excuse me,
hugelkultur full of these auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they finished the end of August and
they were beautiful and they were able to
[SPEAKER_04]: move them into the extraction market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, are auto flowers going to be ready
for the California flower only market now?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of a stretch.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but you also got to remember where you
are as far as the totality of the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are are growing Olympic level
plants and genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, it's probably going to be
more for patients and home growers and
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction and hashing at the beginning
until they get some of that sexy bag
[SPEAKER_04]: appeal of the stuff that you normally
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are auto flowers like what the.
[SPEAKER_02]: How were those bred?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, could I take a strain of mine and
turn it into an auto flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what do you know much about that
process?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, while I'm not breeding auto flowers
myself, I interact with a lot of breeders
[SPEAKER_04]: who are doing it because, you know,
for I have been carrying the the gospel of
[SPEAKER_04]: auto flowers across the country with
talks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so auto flower folks who are breeding
reach out to me and say, hey, what are you
[SPEAKER_04]: what are you hearing?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you learning?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you what do you think of these
seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they are, you know, you are
choosing a ruralist culture cultivar that
[SPEAKER_04]: you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the root of a ruderalis, you know,
lineage, if you will, has come from
[SPEAKER_04]: Siberia in Russia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have got very short summers and
very early winters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these plants were discovered that
that are used to very short summertime.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as soon as they are biologically
mature, they immediately go into flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that is where we get the short
season from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then folks take their favorite regular
cultivars like the one that you have that
[SPEAKER_04]: might be, you know, a farm specialty for
yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they cross them into the ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then your first wave, you'll have a
certain percentage and then you'll sift
[SPEAKER_04]: those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then and then normally this is where
I, you know, I get become less involved at
[SPEAKER_04]: this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but normally by the by the second
generation, you have yourself at,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, at a significant number of auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're ready to breed those for
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does take a bit of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's certainly not as simple as just
pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we all love to, you know,
you know, everybody can can do a simple
[SPEAKER_04]: cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: These take a little more effort and more
time to sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of making a seed in a season,
you're talking about more like three or
[SPEAKER_04]: bringing your project indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so the short answer is, yeah,
you can totally take your favorite strains
[SPEAKER_04]: from your farm and make them autos if you
decide you want to take on that project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and while I've seen most of the
mainstream cultivars that have been auto
[SPEAKER_04]: flowered, they do have a slightly
different taste because the ruderalis does
[SPEAKER_04]: carry some of its own flavor profile in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the more you work it, you know,
the closer it can be to your original
[SPEAKER_04]: ideal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, it isn't always that the the
the ruderalis makes the plant taste worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it can actually round out the
taste of a plant that originally was only
[SPEAKER_04]: one note.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I remember these two way,
way, way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Wendy does to the ruderalis name.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I heard it was probably
like late 80s or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were kind of popular with the
gorilla growing techniques, too,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the plants did stay smaller and
they were kind of easier to tuck away and
[SPEAKER_02]: hide under the bushes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was the first I heard of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of maybe they came and went.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now they're coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we definitely played with that back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's not the same thing as it
was, because back in the day, it was
[SPEAKER_01]: really not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was it was literally we
didn't even know the term root.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we knew the term ruderalis,
but we called it ditch weed because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like the stuff that grew in the ditches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just I mean, it didn't have
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't have terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really didn't get you very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was much closer to what we consider
hemp nowadays than what we are now
[SPEAKER_01]: terminology using the terminology of an
auto flower, which is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of wondering, like, who is
bringing it back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't think it's just popped
into the scene as these amazing auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet I haven't heard about the people
like this should have taken at least,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, three to four years to get the
right root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruderalis and get the strain at least a
little bit stabilized so that your
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars are decent and then working that
strain through to increase your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, just like you were saying,
Shango, just working that line to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: the positive aspects of what you want in
your cultivar and decreasing those
[SPEAKER_01]: negative aspects that used to come with
with ruderalis back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's funny that you say, you know,
you you you wish you, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're surprised you hadn't heard of it or
you or you should have heard of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing is, is that auto flower
people, because of the bad, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: because of the trash that is talked by by
many heritage outdoor breeders,
[SPEAKER_04]: auto flower breeders were laughed off of
forums and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the the the arrogance of of
heritage growers and people who just
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to grow big trees caused the auto
flower people to have to create a
[SPEAKER_04]: community of their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there actually is a huge community
of auto flower people naturally nationally
[SPEAKER_04]: that your listeners can connect with at
auto flower dot net because the auto
[SPEAKER_04]: flower breeders who, you know,
were pushed off these other forums by just
[SPEAKER_04]: being laughed at.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, fine, we're going to take
our ball and go home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they went home and they started
their own breeding community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have been working together and
trading genetics and trading best
[SPEAKER_04]: practices and, you know, developing the
the better ruderalis that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: imparts the timing, but not the taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now there's not only a lot of
commercial growers that are putting out,
[SPEAKER_04]: excuse me, commercial breeders that are
putting out, you know, commercial quality
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, heck, most of the commercial hemp
market is based on auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then also there's so many bedroom
breeders who are breeding exceptional
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds now that are available at commercial
scale that you can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the important things for for all
of us in cannabis media to do is to shake
[SPEAKER_04]: off the reputation that auto flowers had
10 years ago and and engage with modern
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders like like Dan Jimmy at
Mandalorian Genetics and Daniel at Heart
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Mountain, who I've already mentioned,
and Zero Zero from Spain and and Daz
[SPEAKER_04]: Mephisto, who's doing a line called Night
Owl under the Mephisto genetics family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all these people are making really
great flowers that are flowers for now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're modernized auto flowers that
people are very happy with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, it really depends on what your
use is.
[SPEAKER_04]: If if you're trying to put an auto flower
versus traditional genetics in California
[SPEAKER_04]: to be ready in October.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the traditional genetics are still
going to be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're trying to get plants to
harvest in August, if you're a patient,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're a home grower or if you've got
to want to have acres and acres of plants
[SPEAKER_04]: and you want them all to be the same so
that you can harvest them uniformly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then auto flowers is a godsend to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also I know that sunshine and I've
actually talked about this a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know other commercial cultivators,
too, that have talked about that in
[SPEAKER_01]: California specifically in order to get a
license, you have to declare what type of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation style you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either outdoor mixed light tier one
or mixed light tier two or indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mixed light tier one means that you're
using light deprivation and under six
[SPEAKER_01]: watts per square foot of supplemental
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, that license costs quite
a bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have state and local license,
state and local permit fees, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: generally more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have excise fees, which are generally
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something like an auto flower that you
could, you know, companion plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: as it were, throughout your full term,
get that boost mid season so that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit of a paycheck before the market
floods in the fall and then harvest those
[SPEAKER_01]: out, let your full term spill in is
something that is, for me, very attractive
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, very interesting as long as
I know I can sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also am Dragonfly Earth Medicine
certified, so we have agreed in that
[SPEAKER_01]: contract to not put anything to
hydrocarbons, so it can't be blasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have to be made into either dry
sift or ice water hash, possibly CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I try to avoid that myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, just a few hash makers
I've talked to, they haven't worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: autos yet and they're like, I don't know,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to hear that there are a lot
of people that are using it for hash and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe that's something we'll have to play
with next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's kind of funny to think
about that even though California is a
[SPEAKER_04]: leader in everything cannabis,
because the rest of the country has got
[SPEAKER_04]: worse weather than you are, you know,
California folks haven't really
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily had the need to explore
outside of traditional seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this probably might be only this
one way California might be catching up
[SPEAKER_04]: with what the rest of us have been doing
for a few years because we don't have your
[SPEAKER_04]: weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the mold, I take mold every year in
the Yale River Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I share some similar issues that
you have there up in Washington,
[SPEAKER_02]: living, growing in the rainforest so to
speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely don't grow certain cultivars
because of the problem that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the botrytis and powdery mildew and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just kind of learned to be very
picky about, you know, cultivars and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also, again, we are in an incredibly
privileged and blessed area for growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis because it has been done here for
so long that we have a lot of stabilized
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of interest coming back into
legacy California cultivation and what
[SPEAKER_01]: those legacy cultivars are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we definitely have not really
seen the need to, you know, play with the
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flowers until, again, most recently
with all of our Prop 64 shenanigans and
[SPEAKER_01]: policy, which, you know, is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I will say for mold or for
botrytis in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, I'm not talking about
smoking the mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is after you remove the mold from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, having a little bit of
botrytis on your plant, that plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will be sweeter and better tasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a little bit of mold will actually
give you a little sweeter smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not smoking the mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how the plant ripens with that
little bit of mold on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I carefully monitor it and I don't want
to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it's going to greatly affect
yields at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just am careful how much of the crop
is a strain that does mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not necessarily, you know,
it is, the plant, it will quicken its
[SPEAKER_02]: ripening just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can also keep you from getting your
plant fully ripe as well with that mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not, you know, it's not the worst
thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it pushes a stress response in the
plant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll actually be like, oh,
shoot, something's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like you're saying, I got to finish
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to push into, you know,
the tricone production and terpenes in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to protect myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always hope for no mold personally,
but.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all of us cannabis growers,
by the third week of September,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're starting to get suspicious and a
little anxious, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're all like checking the
weather and making sure our airflow is
[SPEAKER_04]: good and watching for molds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when the rains come, you know,
crops can go bad quickly if we're
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially or in hoops or things like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is remarkable to have the
experience of seeing plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that that magical last week when you smell
those mature terpene profiles and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: all like, God, I love being a cannabis
farmer, you know, and like we usually only
[SPEAKER_04]: get that one time a year unless we depth
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we smell them and everything to get
that experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first week of September, when and have
no mold and be able to harvest and have
[SPEAKER_04]: everything hung and be done and have it be
September 15th by that point and realize
[SPEAKER_04]: that, you know, you you you harvested 95
percent of your plants perfectly healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They smell great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really startling, different,
startingly different growing experience
[SPEAKER_04]: than growing full terms, which I adore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got nothing bad to say about full
terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for depending on where you live,
they don't finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for those people, auto flowers may
be a really good option.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do those auto flowers ripen kind of
similar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you let them go slightly over?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're still good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can definitely let them go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the things that's cool about
auto flowers is that they've got a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: more flexibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only can you let them go a little
long, let's say in case let's say you're
[SPEAKER_04]: planted and, oh, gosh, you have to
evacuate.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it takes you another week or so or,
you know, 10 days to to harvest them,
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got a little more.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a little larger window of
opportunity than you do trying to do that
[SPEAKER_04]: in October.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing that really gets
people's attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, most of us have got food gardens
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we want to be self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that we do
throughout the summer is
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, oh, cereal planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the phrase I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Consecutive planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, where you plant some this week and
you plant some next week and you plant
[SPEAKER_04]: some the next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can do that with auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can take a plant that,
say, for example, a 92 day from
[SPEAKER_04]: germination to to harvest plant and you
can plant you know, one group of them on
[SPEAKER_04]: May 15th and another group on the on the
21st and another group on June 1st.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that instead of having to harvest all
your crop within a week, you can actually
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest some every week over the course of
a month, which succession planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm trying to think of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And succession planting like this is
wildly more convenient than waiting,
[SPEAKER_04]: waiting, waiting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's pull.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything as fast as we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's that changes things
again for California market, because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: always talking about the drying space.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much drying space do you need and how
much more do you have to get and what kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, ADA compliant government
sanctioned commercial building do I need
[SPEAKER_01]: to dry my weed in?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm getting more and more convinced as
this goes forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting more and more convinced as
this goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to see if I can get some good
melt out of there and some good grease.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't really seen it yet,
but I'm not all that experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I wish that we would have been able
to connect at Emerald Cup Sunshine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have been able to hand you some
decent melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for you to try.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it really depends on what people
experience as their, air quotes,
[SPEAKER_04]: end of season, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we all look at different
attributes for end of season.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for some people it's,
you know, less sun and cooler days.
[SPEAKER_04]: For some folks, it's fog.
[SPEAKER_04]: For some folks like me, it's cooler nights
below 55.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks, it's rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might come early.
[SPEAKER_04]: For people who have got these sorts of
problems at the end of their season,
[SPEAKER_04]: auto flowers are a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if people are particularly into the
size of the plants because they've got
[SPEAKER_04]: numerical limits, being in the ground
helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the smaller auto flowers that
people see pictures of and they find
[SPEAKER_04]: dissatisfying is because these plants are
also in containers and they're not in,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, 300 gallon, you know,
huge, linen containers either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people grow an auto flower in five to
seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're on a deck or they're
indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the plants are not really given the
opportunity to do, you know, be to their
[SPEAKER_04]: full potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you are somewhere that is growing
an auto flower either right in the ground
[SPEAKER_04]: or in a large pot of really active living
soil, the plants really do get bountiful
[SPEAKER_04]: and bigger with larger flowers and more
identifiable bud structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that there's not as many
photographs of those on Instagram for
[SPEAKER_04]: people to see because again, the people
who were first adopters of auto flowers
[SPEAKER_04]: are people with less than ideal conditions
for growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things I wanted to ask you
about too is the community of growers
[SPEAKER_02]: where you live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you speak a little bit about the
growers where you are in the community
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any trade associations or?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here on Vashon Island, we have gone
through a very significant transition
[SPEAKER_04]: since the normalization and the existence
of a licensed market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So historically, Vashon Island has been a
very popular, unlicensed, underground
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis growing community.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had good flowers coming out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had, you know, a ray of good purple
genetics like OVP, which here is known as
[SPEAKER_04]: the original Vashon Purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And bands that would come to Seattle would
intentionally put their feelers out to
[SPEAKER_04]: have somebody come over to Vashon Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, invite somebody to the show
that would bring them some Vashon grown
[SPEAKER_04]: flower during their tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the island's been in some
popular magazines.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a classic early 80s Playboy
episode that talks about Vashon cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, there's a bit of a
reputation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when medical got started,
suddenly became far more popular because
[SPEAKER_04]: the underground growers were kind of
selling against each other on the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there wasn't a lot of the flower
leaving the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Vashon had incredible flower at very
low prices because these talented growers
[SPEAKER_04]: were just selling against each other in
the same community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the prices tended to go down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once medical started, that's where I got
involved more with cannabis here on Vashon
[SPEAKER_04]: Island by starting a trade organization
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Called Vimea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Originally, it was the Vashon Island
Marijuana Entrepreneurs Alliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: But since licensing, we've changed the E
from being entrepreneur to being
[SPEAKER_04]: enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in the early days of Vimea,
what I was doing was developing
[SPEAKER_04]: relationships with the dispensaries over
town in Seattle and Port Orchard in
[SPEAKER_04]: Tacoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were moving the flowers that were
grown on island into dispensaries all
[SPEAKER_04]: around the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: All around the Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, farmers were happy because they
were getting more for their pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also we started doing things like bulk
buying soil and other soil amendments and
[SPEAKER_04]: inputs in bulk as a group and then
splitting them up so that everybody could
[SPEAKER_04]: save money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started having meetings and then
the laws changed, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I know how Prop 64 screwed so many of
your people and the same thing happened
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they gave licenses to a whole bunch
of people who were new to the industry and
[SPEAKER_04]: were not part of the medical scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they limited the licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of people who wanted to
transition from the legal-ish medical
[SPEAKER_04]: market to the more legal licensed market
were not given that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, as you all are experiencing down
there, they started cracking down on
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody else who doesn't have a license.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it became the people who were
growing for the medicinal market and doing
[SPEAKER_04]: so with some amount of legal protections
now don't have the stores to take their
[SPEAKER_04]: product and also are under much greater
risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've seen this change from there
being maybe two dozen significant,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, traditional market growers back
in the day and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a whole bunch of small things,
but, you know, two dozen big ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And granted, we only have about 10,000
people on the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that transitioned to, oh, my gosh,
you know, several hundred medical growers
[SPEAKER_04]: on the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now the the commercial scale black
market unlicensed folks are mostly gone on
[SPEAKER_04]: the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the medical people are definitely gone
because there's no stores to sell in to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we have now is a lot more people
growing for their own head.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got a lot of people who used to
be afraid to grow, you know, five or 10
[SPEAKER_04]: plants for themselves, a lot more people
doing that for themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got a much more decentralized
grow for yourself environment here on the
[SPEAKER_04]: island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people who are not growing for
themselves are either buying in the still
[SPEAKER_04]: existing, you know, heritage market on the
island or honestly, people go to the two
[SPEAKER_04]: stores on the island, even though the
prices are high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you believe it?
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't test for pesticides in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: People, the convenience and the variety is
really great because you don't find a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of people growing sativas on the island
because they can't grow outdoors here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not a lot of people want to spend 12
or 13 weeks of electricity to essentially
[SPEAKER_04]: get the same for the same price as you
would a bag of indica or and so the
[SPEAKER_04]: market's really changed here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very unusual thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one of the things that I want to
just recognize Washington Ford,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's also a member of your
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: David Rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came from Humboldt originally,
but one of the things is sungrown.
[SPEAKER_02]: If Washington had not passed ungrown with
their legalization, it might have been
[SPEAKER_02]: harder for us in California, believe it or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, really, that was Jimmy
Moberg from Cannesville Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also had a lot to do with getting sun
growing into Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that that also helped us
here in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeremy Moberg is a he's a force to be
reckoned with.
[SPEAKER_04]: He he not only is a high energy person who
does a lot of research, but he doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: take no for an answer very often.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's got a lot of inertia behind him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I've I've interviewed him on my
first podcast for Gangepreneur.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we talked at length about the
importance of sungrown both for cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: culture, but also it was important to not
make all flour have to be grown indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: with electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, eventually we're going to be
growing indoor with solar, but the
[SPEAKER_04]: batteries are not quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we will get there eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the you know, one of the worst parts
of indoor will, you know, be gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that'll be great for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Activists like Jeremy and the Sun Growers
Association and, of course, all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful sun grown people that you've got
down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really took us working together
because, you know, the politicians mostly
[SPEAKER_04]: they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the minimum that they have to put
on the line to make this happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: And doing the bare minimum to protect
yourself politically is really not going
[SPEAKER_04]: to necessarily make the best policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for them to say, OK, we're going to
allow cannabis, but oh, gosh, people might
[SPEAKER_04]: get it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to do it under lock and key in
buildings.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a that is a crisis of vision.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is people who are not choosing to
learn the bigger picture or they are being
[SPEAKER_04]: influenced by indoor lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there's a lot of influence
going on by lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think there's some amount of,
you know, kind of backpedaling that the
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians have to do because there's
been so many decades of stigmatizing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that it's so widely recognized and
accepted, it's really hard for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: just be like, oops, are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, all cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go and do you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like, well, we're not going to
necessarily say this isn't dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to say that maybe you need it
if you have a medical condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still need to be, you know,
conscientious of keeping the children
[SPEAKER_01]: safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's really,
at least in California and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Western states, this real push of,
you know, safety and environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: concern, which are all very legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's funny to talk about
environmentalism and then still allow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so much indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, I'm not going to go too far
down that road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's just a whole wormhole in
and of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I definitely think that sun grown and
outdoor is, you know, obviously kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: where we need to be pushing and having
things like auto flowers is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: could help those smaller growers get
through some of these processes to to get
[SPEAKER_01]: to where they would like to be,
which is maybe just doing full term
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one way there's one challenging
about auto flowers that's worth
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is the fact that you cannot clone
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there is an increased price to
growing auto flowers because, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so much so many of us will we will hunt
for the particular mom or moms that we
[SPEAKER_04]: really like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we will clone heavily.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we have those plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with auto flowers, since you cannot
clone them, you have to germinate your
[SPEAKER_04]: seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most people germinate it in the final
pot or ground, if that's what they're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to do, because they don't transplant
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means that instead of buying one
pack of seeds and hunting it for mothers
[SPEAKER_04]: and making a few hundred or more clones
off of that, if you want 600 plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: you need to buy 600 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that is something for people to be
aware of as well, because that's not
[SPEAKER_04]: that's not a convenient aspect of autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Shango, you said if you want 600
plants, you have to buy 600 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these being feminized or are they
straight run?
[SPEAKER_04]: Both both.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, certainly the feminized auto
flower seeds are a hotter property and
[SPEAKER_04]: they are more popular and they sell more
because generally the people who are
[SPEAKER_04]: growing auto flowers in the first place
have got space, time or just convenience
[SPEAKER_04]: issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And man, there is nothing more sad than
mentoring or helping out a cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: patient who grows seven plants and then
four or five of them end up being male and
[SPEAKER_04]: they have to call them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now they're down to two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, that's such a sad thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the kinds of people who are our
first to experiment with auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're mostly getting feminized seeds
because they want to know if they grow
[SPEAKER_04]: seven seeds, they're going to have seven
medicine producing plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so certainly there are lots of regular
male female seeds available in the auto
[SPEAKER_04]: flower market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're fabulous.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are not for everybody either.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a call in question from someone who
said that everyone he knows who grows auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers has a problem with hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you comment on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was certainly a problem back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't I can't ask the caller,
you know, how many of their friends and
[SPEAKER_04]: where do they live and what seeds do they
use and how long ago was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, hermaphrodites can show up
in regular seeds and in them seeds and in
[SPEAKER_04]: auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sloppy breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can sloppy breed in anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sloppier stuff that I've received from
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll see some bananas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll see some bananas in my regular
stuff as well from a sloppy breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you're getting your seeds,
make sure they know what they're doing and
[SPEAKER_04]: buy good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say there's been something
going on lately also because we have some
[SPEAKER_01]: legacy cultivars that we've been growing
for, you know, forever and still managed
[SPEAKER_01]: to get some real hermaphrodite this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked with a lot of people that are
like, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this isn't normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been I've seen quite a few grows
now, a surprising number that grew really
[SPEAKER_01]: good genetics from really good breeders
and ended up having all kinds of very
[SPEAKER_01]: bizarre things happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most notable was a early bloom where
it did not come out of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it started putting out vegetative
branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those would go into bloom and
that would put out another vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were getting all of this like
different kind of like a consecutive
[SPEAKER_01]: planting of corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was all one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like I've seen that once about
five or six years ago with a cultivar that
[SPEAKER_01]: we got out of China Creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it grew great for the first year and
it grew great for the second year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third year it did exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never seen it since until this
year when I know four growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them didn't tell me who the
genetics or cultivar was, but at least two
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders not related.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while I do agree that most
hermaphrodism is sloppy breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: or it's a cookie genetic, which just has
that tendency and then not good
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation strategies and their cultural
methodology is off and they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, have light leaks and weirdness
of that sort or watering issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it kind of is interesting to see
that there's some weird things happening
[SPEAKER_01]: this year too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I don't know with the
hermaphrodism and the auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: if that's something like you were saying,
if that was current or previous,
[SPEAKER_01]: we never experienced that with auto
flowers way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, I only played with them
once and then I was not going to mess with
[SPEAKER_01]: it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: For your listeners who are very much
interested in plants that hermaphrodite or
[SPEAKER_04]: more technically become intersex,
the podcast that I host, Shaping Fire,
[SPEAKER_04]: we had a really good interview recently
with cannabis breeder Ryan Lee,
[SPEAKER_04]: also known as Chimera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes into detail about female only
breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we talk at length about what causes
plants to go intersex and the variety of
[SPEAKER_04]: pressures that can be put on a plant to
cause them to show, you know, both
[SPEAKER_04]: genders.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so folks might want to check that out
if they're, you know, if they're nerds
[SPEAKER_04]: about hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which episode is that again, Shango?
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I knew the number.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to guess it's like 65.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know it off the top of my head,
but it's with Ryan Lee, Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard that one yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to backtrack a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working and not listening very
much to anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's definitely an interesting
aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far so good on my in-house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have any hermaphrodite going on
or any branches, but yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's any other callers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And callers, there are a few minutes to
call into the radio show and we can't put
[SPEAKER_02]: you on the air, but our engineer BR can
take your questions and we can get to you,
[SPEAKER_02]: get to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the number is 923-3911.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you caller.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were asking earlier about growing in
the Pacific Northwest and it's fun because
[SPEAKER_04]: many people consider indoor originating
here in the Pacific Northwest and the
[SPEAKER_04]: first big jumps and lights, you know,
starting here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I must admit, I have not dug deeply
into that histories, but it's a common
[SPEAKER_04]: thing for me to hear even when I'm down in
your area at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: People talking about the early tech and
best practices coming out of indoor in
[SPEAKER_04]: this area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, we've got really great
indoor in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we have a good summer,
it's so much more preferable to get the
[SPEAKER_04]: wide open terpene profiles that you get
under the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course it's less expensive and it's
easier to hide and you know, it just feels
[SPEAKER_04]: good to grow in the ground versus indoors
or in a tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing we've been experiencing is
that even though the Pacific Northwest is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be a good place to live for,
you know, the rest of my lifetime anyway,
[SPEAKER_04]: there is no doubt that the climate is
changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we will eventually have longer,
hotter summers, more like Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the moment, we are experiencing
the increasingly wet winters, which means
[SPEAKER_04]: that when we used to just get like,
oh, a little spot of rain the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: September, a little spot the first week or
two of October, and then about October
[SPEAKER_04]: 15th, the rains really started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our cold, our nights going below 55
started six weeks ago and our rain started
[SPEAKER_04]: four weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly there is seasonal variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you listen to the meteorologist,
they're saying, wow, every year the rains
[SPEAKER_04]: are starting early earlier and earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's another benefit of autoflowers
is that if your medicine or your income is
[SPEAKER_04]: based on bringing in agriculture,
it's a great idea to have some autoflowers
[SPEAKER_04]: going as a backup plan in case like this
year, we have the worst weather that we've
[SPEAKER_04]: had in a decade for growing outdoor
full-term cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are losing, you know,
easily 60, 70% of their outdoor uncovered
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, even in hoop houses, because we've
had so much fog and cold nights that puts
[SPEAKER_04]: the substrate to sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, but the people who also had
autoflowers and they hedged their luck,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're like, yeah, you know, I'm taking a
hit this year on my full terms,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I pulled in a whole bunch of autos.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll still be able to, you know,
take care of either my medicine or their
[SPEAKER_04]: customers, you know, for the time being.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that some of the hermaphrodism
we're experiencing this year is because
[SPEAKER_01]: like for me and most of us that have been
doing this for quite some time,
[SPEAKER_01]: we generally start our seeds right in mid
February, mid to end of February.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were the plants that most of us
had the most trouble with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's because our year was just
so weird this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so cold for so much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the plants possibly kind of
thought it was going into winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden it was summer and
then they just got confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that can just warp those
kind of that epigenetical potential of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you guys are getting our,
it's a longer winter than we're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: these just a shift of seasons almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember that cold spell we had
early, early in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did plant later, which made me why I
didn't have many issues with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, I got another listener question
about auto flowers and she, I think she
[SPEAKER_00]: direct seeded and she said it took two
weeks longer than she expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the, you know, how long do they
go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it blend on the variety?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause this one was an OG strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, there's, there is a,
there's a, they seem to, depending on the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the original the cultivar that you're,
you're breeding into that will play a
[SPEAKER_04]: role.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there are different, there are
different Ruderalis cultivars that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: go into.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so loose, loosely auto flowers run
into 60, 90 and a hundred day cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly I've really only come across good
plants that are 90 to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: 90 to a hundred days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say good, I mean, I'm looking
for bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, there's fantastic small plants
that are 60 days, but that's just really
[SPEAKER_04]: not enough time to get big for,
you know, the kind of effort that I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, when the plants take longer when
direct seeded, it's usually because the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant is not being kept warm enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, certainly I don't know what you're,
what the caller is doing, but we
[SPEAKER_04]: experienced that here ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people tried to start their auto
flower seeds May 1st this year,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was cold here until second week of
June.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and so a lot of people who direct
seeded in the beginning of May,
[SPEAKER_04]: their plants just sat there as sprigs
until June.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they started going off and they,
they weren't entirely successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas people who waited a month to June
1st.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they direct seeded into a warm
substrate where the microbe life was
[SPEAKER_04]: alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: They popped right up and these were the
same seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They popped some of them in May and some
of them in June.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so keeping the substrate warm,
I don't think that in most cases,
[SPEAKER_04]: substrates are going to be, you know,
as warm in May in most parts of the
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the workarounds that we've used is
to, even though the plants don't like to
[SPEAKER_04]: be transplanted, if you want to grow in
the ground, which is always warmer,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can start in a one gallon and let the
plant start indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the first, say two,
two and a half weeks, then go ahead and
[SPEAKER_04]: transplant it outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way the, you can transplant outdoors
without disturbing the root zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people get away with that,
but you want it, you want to make sure you
[SPEAKER_04]: keep that root zone warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Shango, you've said a few times that
they don't like being transplanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that just that they're going through
some heavy transplant shots?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what's the deal with the transplanting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_04]: These plants don't live very long and
we're all used to with photos,
[SPEAKER_04]: we transplant them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It slows them down for, you know,
a little bit and then they just come on
[SPEAKER_04]: right back and that's no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if a plant's only going to live for 90
days, the transplant shock slows them down
[SPEAKER_04]: enough to make them really, you know,
disappointing plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when using autoflowers, you want to do
your best to germinate in the soil you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to stay at and you don't want to
disturb the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you want to pack your one gallon a
little more tightly so that when you,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you were to transplant into a larger
container or the ground, that you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: disturb the roots that will be in the
interior of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So could you do a direct seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to me like thinking back to
some traditional agriculture, what we used
[SPEAKER_01]: to do way back in the day was you have
these little things called cloches or hot
[SPEAKER_01]: caps, and you would put that over your
tomato to germinate your tomato in ground
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just like it created a tiny
miniature greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering if that would be
something that might work for that or if
[SPEAKER_01]: you think it would still be too cold
regardless?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that's a great idea actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's interesting too is that when we
are direct seeding outdoors, we run into
[SPEAKER_04]: many more mice and bird problems because
normally when we go outside, we're already
[SPEAKER_04]: to a, you know, 12 inch or more clone that
is not as susceptible to mouse and bird.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're putting an autoflower seed
that is this like delicious, newly alive
[SPEAKER_04]: morsel birds and mice are way more likely
to attack them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once, what, four years ago or so,
we lost like, you know, 30 of these
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, you know, when you're,
when you're buying them right off the
[SPEAKER_04]: shelf and you're paying 10 bucks a seed,
that hurts, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think the idea of a cloche or,
you know, a lot of people just take,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, plastic two liter bottles that
would normally go into the trash or the
[SPEAKER_04]: recycling and they'll, they'll cut off the
bottoms of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, certainly that's not going to work at
commercial scale, but for somebody who's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to do 10 plants in their yard,
that'll be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, I mean, commercial scale,
even if you're still paying $10 a seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, that starts to lose its
attractiveness pretty rapidly for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: At commercial levels, you're not paying
$10 a seed though, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying $10 a seed if you're buying
a pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: At commercial level, if you're buying a
hundred or a thousand seeds, those seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: are more down like two or three bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might have a, you know,
a commercial volume you have to buy at
[SPEAKER_04]: that rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the vast majority still, like,
like we're all saying, they're,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're, the auto flower folks fall into
two categories, patients and home growers
[SPEAKER_04]: who are buying like one or two or more
packs and they're growing those,
[SPEAKER_04]: or commercial, scale people and they are
buying in, in, you know, 100, 500 or 5,000
[SPEAKER_04]: counts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're very different markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, they're, they're different
types of seeds too.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's far more variety in the,
in the, I don't know, the, the patient and
[SPEAKER_04]: home grower market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there are people who are creating a
large scale seeds, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: by far the, the top commercial grower,
or breeder is Oregon CBD seeds that makes
[SPEAKER_04]: plants for the hemp market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their minimum buy is 5,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas you get to somebody who's making
high quality THC plants, like Daniel from
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart Rock Mountain, you know,
he's doing a hundred and 500 packs into
[SPEAKER_04]: the light licensed market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And much less that you're going to buy one
pack at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hey, I noticed that we're,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say, I noticed we're
getting to the top of the hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I plug a couple of things before we
suddenly close?
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so, so, um, first I'd like to,
uh, plug the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, if, if you are interested in
interviews with the top minds in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, with an eye towards regenerative first
and patients, um, I encourage you to check
[SPEAKER_04]: out my podcast shaping fire, where we
focus on, uh, cultivation technique,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, solvent lists and hashing technique
and a lot of patient focused medical
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis topics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find that at shaping fire.com or
wherever you download your podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we also have a very successful YouTube
channel with over 200 videos of different
[SPEAKER_04]: speakers and events that I attend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just bring those back and upload them to
the YouTube channel and you can find that
[SPEAKER_04]: on YouTube either by searching Shire or my
name Shango Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're really into the auto flower
topic, um, there have been a couple more
[SPEAKER_04]: auto flower episodes on shaping fire that
are in depth, but then on the YouTube
[SPEAKER_04]: channel, there's also, uh, uh,
videos of Jeff Lowenfels, the soil
[SPEAKER_04]: specialist talking about auto flowers,
uh, Seth Crawford from Oregon CBD talking
[SPEAKER_04]: in detail about the rise of the auto
flower market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so just want to direct folks that,
uh, you know, most people enjoy listening
[SPEAKER_04]: to a podcast while they're trimming or
working in the garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I invite you to check out shaping fire
.com and hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was telling people before you came on
that, um, I was not a fan of podcasts
[SPEAKER_01]: until I found shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden the whole world of,
you know, all of the information on
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts became, it just shifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea that there were podcasts
like that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you're a commercial
cultivator, and you go back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of these shaping fire episodes,
there's really important, amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm glad you turned on the podcast
and thank you so much for having me on the
[SPEAKER_04]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
