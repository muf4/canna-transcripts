[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you do a presentation,
you're always very clear to point out that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of active debate on a lot of
these topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's very fair and you'll
often give both sides and then just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of give your opinion of what you think is
going to end up being right over time in
[SPEAKER_00]: the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those hot debates right now is
the bacteria to fungal ratio in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh my God, like the online debates are
like a blood sport, you know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you're a nice even
handed guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would appreciate if you would give us
a general overview of what the debate
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have a little context and then
give us an idea of where you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to end up being played out for
Canada specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, for those who don't
know anything about fungal bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: relation, your soil is usually dominated
by either fungus or it is dominated by
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's dominated by fungus,
then it likes a ammonia type of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: or micro food, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's got a bacterial dominance,
it likes the nitrate type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two kinds of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All soils have a balance of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, if it has more fungi than
bacteria, it is acidic in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it has more bacteria than fungi,
it is a basic or an alkaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it is bacteria, it has nitrogen
fixing bacteria that fix the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are those differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your soils have one or the other or
dominance, but they have both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's always some fungi in bacterial
soil and vice versa, unless you're at the
[SPEAKER_01]: very far ends of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when we first started talking about
this stuff and the concept really has been
[SPEAKER_01]: developed by Dr. Lane Ingham, who is a
goddess among mortals as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never want to put words in her
mouth, but Dr. Lane Ingham showed us about
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal bacteria ratio and explained to us
that if you are in a beginning ecological
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, what I call the beach,
you know, where life is just beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to the old growth forest,
which is the other end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're at that beach end,
you have bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is nothing really for the fungi to
eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as things grow and develop,
you start to get detritus and fungi move
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you move further along that
spectrum, more and more fungi begin to
appear.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria number basically stays the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get all the way over to the old
growth forest, you've got so much stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: for the fungi to eat that fungi dominate
the soil 50,000 to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they really, they really go nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got those two ends of the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to know what your plant
likes, you figure out where along that
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum, you get, I suspect that debate
started this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was too difficult for me to figure
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Lane is a lot smarter than me,
I promise you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just too difficult for me to
figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so I came up with this idea
because I was giving talks to regular
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners, not intelligent, highly
intelligent cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had to dumb down the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came up with this idea that if you
grow things for less than a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: they like bacterially dominated soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically when you look at the
spectrum that Dr. Lane has, sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow things for more than a year,
perennials and trees and shrubs,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tend to want fungally dominated soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've got this slide, fungal
dominated is more than a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: less than a year is bacterially dominated.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is less than a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is bacterially dominated,
says Jeff Lohenfeld.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Dr. Lane, again, a lot smarter than I
am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she's done some research and she's
decided that no, really cannabis has a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit higher bacterial, I mean a
fungal ratio than bacterial ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm willing to accept that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't bother me at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm willing to accept anything Dr. Lane
says frankly, but she really, what she has
[SPEAKER_01]: done for the world is phenomenal as far as
I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so maybe a little bit more
bacterial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, last night we talked about
autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the new race car of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, they are so fast and it's hard for
me to believe that they want a fungally
[SPEAKER_01]: dominated soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll experiment and find it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little fungi versus a bacteria makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria like green things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like sweet things, molasses,
straws, hay, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the green mulches we were talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the green mulches and then the fungi
like the brown mulches and so you can use
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for folks who don't know, brown
mulches, we're talking things like wood
[SPEAKER_00]: chips and just leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go out and just pull a bunch of leaves
off my yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure they're not oak leaves because
those are allopathic to a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then the more you grind them up,
the more bacterial oriented they become.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take a fungal food and really
grind it up, it becomes a bacterial food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you really wanted to do it right,
you get a fungal food, grind it so it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bacterial, little fungal food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if folks want to know which side
they're dominant on, is this something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can just get from a simple soil
test?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's one where you need a soil food
web test or a microscope of your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a grid and try to figure it
all out or you can bottle some and send it
[SPEAKER_01]: into a soil food web lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you find the soil food web lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: You Google them and they're all around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you your fungal bacterial
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, thanks for taking apart that debate
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I probably cost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
