Thanks very much
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that very kind welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys don't have time for your
conference, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this wonderful speech all prepared
and it's pretty much gripped it up after
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday's announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll touch on a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first of all, thanks so much for
having me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, where to start, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot has happened in the last 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought what I'd try to do is take
something I can, share what's been
[SPEAKER_00]: developing in the last 24 hours,
obviously with a focus on the announcement
[SPEAKER_00]: by the Attorney General.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to that specifically,
though, and you touch on this in your
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction, is I just have such
tremendous frustrations with the Attorney
[SPEAKER_00]: General.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not just because we have a
disagreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, truly not, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have disagreements with people all the
time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of my job as a lawyer is off an
adversarial system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from a family of seven kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six boys, one mom's covering sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a big family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we're at the Christmas table
or the Thanksgiving table.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't all agree on everything,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way it works in a big family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm used to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the part that the Attorney General,
I just want to get to first, that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: is important is number one, we had no idea
this was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had no idea this was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, the governor, if you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two is the Attorney General,
since he became Attorney General,
[SPEAKER_00]: has simply refused immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Refused me with the governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think face-to-face conversations on
issues of this magnitude, the legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana for God's sakes, right,
what that means for our country and our
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty big, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it strikes me that face-to-face
conversation is helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean you're going to agree on
everything, but they're helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an example, right after I got elected
Attorney General, Governor James Lee was
[SPEAKER_00]: elected governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, President Obama was coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington had legalized marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Holder was the Attorney General.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to do systems that we're
going to put in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked Eric Holder if we could meet
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, back then, things were really
uncertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado and Washington were the two
states that legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't sure what the Obama
administration would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my old Washington, Colorado legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked for a meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got that meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was in a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were back in D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: with Eric Holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that's productive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: My role in that meeting was pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to communicate to Eric Holder
respectfully, but communicate to him very
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly that I would defend the will of
voters in Washington state, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That there was no end game that did not
involve Washington having legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana from my standpoint, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was open to talk about things up to that
point, but that's the end game from my
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, Attorney General Sessions,
he won't meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He won't meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What aggravates me even beyond that is we
got a letter from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's that date.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was earlier this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a letter from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the letter is a lengthy letter signed
by the Attorney General to Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: state, myself, the governor, in which he's
very critical of Washington state's
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a disagreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the part that's so frustrating is that
in that letter, he literally is saying
[SPEAKER_00]: things like, oh, there's a problem in
Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got this great market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have brought together your bed of cola
and recreational marijuana systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: He cites a report.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The report is years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And subsequent to that report,
of course, the state legislature brought
[SPEAKER_00]: those systems together.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's oblivious to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whatever wrote the letter for him is
oblivious to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you, I mean, candidly, candidly,
it's hard to take someone seriously who
[SPEAKER_00]: signs a letter like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just being, I'm a raccoon,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to take someone seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to engage intellectually and
understand what actually is happening in a
[SPEAKER_00]: system that he reports to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and that wasn't the only,
I mean, there are misstatements of facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just was, it was riddled with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the governor and I wrote a very,
very detailed letter back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was August of this year that
was maybe a bit more candid than I would
[SPEAKER_00]: typically write to a city U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney General.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I felt things had to be said,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things had to be said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this did not really come as a surprise
as happened yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I had to, it's been a full year.
[SPEAKER_00]: His views on marijuana are very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess a couple points about what
came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one we're surprised, two is what came
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This memo, as you know, it's very,
very brief, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not lengthy documents, very, very brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that could have been
crafted by a member of his team in 25
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a complicated document,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rolling back the golden ran and the Ogden
ran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about the Ogden ran in a minute
as well, which doesn't get as much
[SPEAKER_00]: attention, but it's important on the
medical marijuana front.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, it's not a detailed work
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I was surprised once he decided to
do something that this was what he did,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there wasn't more to it, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not minimizing at all what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deeply disappointing, deeply troubling,
what the impacts are on him long-term,
[SPEAKER_00]: remain to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about that from my
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since it's been a full year,
I thought it couldn't be worse,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the program gonna take a specific step
at Washington State to stop Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: State from moving forward, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What he did, of course, is say,
hey, all of you U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys, you've got the discretion to
basically do what you think is
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part that, I don't know if it
surprised me, but in rolling back the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden ran, which of course was by the
Obama administration that said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, states like Colorado and Washington,
which I legalized at that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: is essentially an uneasy truce,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, essentially they were
communicating, you can move forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, just make sure marijuana's not in the
hands of minors, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting beyond your state borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty reasonable request.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can work to that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have for a number of years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he eliminated DAPT, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He took that DAPT, that guidance,
where essentially it's a low priority to
[SPEAKER_00]: process marijuana cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he also, in the footnote, lawyers
always know, read the footnotes very
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the footnote, he mentions the Ogden
memorandum of 2009, which many of you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably know is a memorandum that applied
to medical marijuana, in which the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Justice said, to U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorneys, it's a letter written,
it's a memo written to U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorneys, folks who prosecute this stuff
on the ground, all around the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of authority in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Ogden memo, what the Department of
Justice said was, when it comes to medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, in states that legalize medical
marijuana, medical marijuana generally,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was 28, maybe, or 29, some of you
probably know this, 29, thank you,
[SPEAKER_00]: 29 states that legalize medical marijuana,
they said someone, a cancer patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: is using medical marijuana in one of those
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a priority for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget the exact words, but the memo is
essentially saying, yeah, no, we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone lives in a state, has medical
marijuana, is using it, that's not your
[SPEAKER_00]: priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got other things to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sessions's memo yesterday took that back
as well, which I don't think people fully
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate right now, where there's so
much going on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that was the focus as much
as, take back the clothing random,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what that's, again, disturbing to me
on many, many levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess a couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, after becoming Attorney General,
my staff were closer to the staff of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney General in Colorado than Colorado
Attorney General, because we're the two
[SPEAKER_00]: states that legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met all the time at conferences,
our staffs talked all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I created a work group of
states that had legalized marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: of AGs of states that had legalized
marijuana, or are going to legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been a group that's been
meeting periodically now, or I guess five
[SPEAKER_00]: years, in which we discuss all sorts of
issues related to the legalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the legal standpoint of defending the
will of the voters, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Internally, my team has been preparing for
something like this to happen for five
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I just want to emphasize to you,
we're not caught flat-footed, our
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments aren't prepared, we have
contemplated hypothetical scenarios in
[SPEAKER_00]: which the will of the voters could be
thwarted, or attempted to be thwarted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're not caught flat-footed by the
federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my team's very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the introduction,
I have some experience with the Trump
[SPEAKER_00]: administration in court, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have sued the Trump administration 19
times, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have sued the Trump administration 19
times, and five of those cases have been
[SPEAKER_00]: resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more appeals, they're over,
and it's not like I'm keeping score of
[SPEAKER_00]: over five and 0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a sixth case, we recently won,
that was the ban on transgender
individuals in the military.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recently won that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That case is not forward, they can appeal
that at some point, you get the idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: but five cases over, we won all five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're not going to win them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each case is obviously different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, the way I view my job is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay focused on my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do anything about what's going on
in Congress, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can write letters to members of Congress
saying, hey, do something to help the
[SPEAKER_00]: banking industry when it comes to
legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send those letters, we communicate,
I've been to DC, I've been able to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Congressional delegation to communicate my
views on that, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not in Congress, I don't have
that, oh, that's not my lane, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can write a letter, but so can you,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I can do, my role is very
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time general of each state,
our job is to defend, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington state law, whether adopted by
the state legislature or adopted by the
[SPEAKER_00]: people through the initiative process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, when it comes to initiatives,
it's critically important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we take that, and I take that
very, very seriously, okay, defending the
[SPEAKER_00]: will of the voters, each and every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just so you know, the folks who work
on this, they are the best attorneys in
[SPEAKER_00]: the office who work on these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the best attorneys in the office
who work on this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get briefings from them all the time,
I have for years when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana legalization, in part because
it's so important to the people who passed
[SPEAKER_00]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: One, in part because there's huge
implications for the state of Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the law firm, or the look on cannabis,
or we give them legal advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of issues that are out
there, we need to be on top of our beam
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the future of what's gonna
happen, I've been asked that a lot lately,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that any more than you do,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what could happen in Washington,
maybe, different than other states,
[SPEAKER_00]: because what Attorney General Sessions has
done is essentially said to those local US
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys, that you have discretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you think is appropriate,
I'm paraphrasing, but that's essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: what they ran and said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, Governor Inslee spoke about
this yesterday at a press conference we
[SPEAKER_00]: had at some length, quite passionately,
where he said basically a no US attorney
[SPEAKER_00]: could walk down the streets of Washington
state trying to shut down marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have spoken, people are doing what
they want, we have a system that's moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that, you know,
US attorneys are aware of what the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who they serve think about any particular
issue, and they have a lot of discretion
[SPEAKER_00]: in what they choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would submit, and I'm gonna be reaching
out to our US attorneys, current ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and any of them that may be appointed by
Trump in the future, is to emphasize a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, we have a system that's working,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, the people want that system,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And number three, don't we have other
priorities?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't we have, I come up with a few,
I bet everybody here could, we could spend
[SPEAKER_00]: all day, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A big one I'm focused on, opioids every
other, that we have in our state,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two people die every day in our state on
average because of an opioid overdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two people every day in Washington state
alone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There we've got opioids prescribed,
I think it's in 2012 we had a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that opioids we've been prescribed in
2012 for every man, woman, and child in
[SPEAKER_00]: our state alone that has a 16 day supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that making any sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we do something about that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we focus our energies on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the conversation I'll be having,
right, with the US attorneys in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern District of Washington and the
Western District of Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately it is up to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks should communicate to them what they
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should do that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not elected officials,
they're appointed, but they're human
[SPEAKER_00]: beings, they're lawyers, they're smart
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should communicate to them what you
think about that, it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one more issue I'll touch on
that's not sessions related before I let
[SPEAKER_00]: you get on with the rest of your
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important in Washington state
setting aside the session situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: controversial one as well in some
respects, less so in other states,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the issue of whether or not local
jurisdictions can ban the sale of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can a city, can a county ban the sale of
marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when our initiative passed,
there was a lot of questions around that
[SPEAKER_00]: because local jurisdictions started
banning the sale of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, wait a second,
if you just passed marijuana, you can't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my office was asked to give a legal
opinion about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My legal opinions are not binding on any
court.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're essentially guidance to state
actors or businesses, but courts
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately resolve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we issue a legal opinion,
our crack record is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a lot of thought on those,
attorney general signs off on those,
[SPEAKER_00]: my sister general knows we're selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some sharp people looking at
those, but they're opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were asked to give that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to emphasize those are not policy
positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not asking, is it a good idea if
local jurisdictions ban the sale of
marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the question I'm asking,
answering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question I'm answering is legally,
legally, do local jurisdictions have the
[SPEAKER_00]: power to ban the sale of marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the legal question I'm answering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer to that question, this is a few
years ago now, was a yes, they do have the
[SPEAKER_00]: authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people aren't happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about that for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of things, without too much on
the legal side of it, but at a high level,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most folks grasp intuitively that
local jurisdictions have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're granted authority by the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set rules, regulations as we see
appropriate or closest to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except local jurisdictions can be bound or
limited by the state, but only if the
[SPEAKER_00]: state is very explicit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the state has to say to
the legislature or the initiative process,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, local jurisdictions, you must do X or
you cannot do Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be very, very explicit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preemptive is what we call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of cases about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the state preempt local
jurisdictions from the usual authority
[SPEAKER_00]: they have and do what they want?
[SPEAKER_00]: We read the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the initiative had had a single
sentence saying all local jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_00]: must provide for the sale of marijuana,
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's preemptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initiative does not say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My view was, I'm not saying it's a good
policy, but I'm saying legally,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, the initiative is silent on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, local jurisdictions retain
their authority that they always have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this has been in court since we issued
our opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine judges around the state have abated
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All nine have agreed with my analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local jurisdictions can't ban the sale of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just Googled this morning when I came
down, California allows for banning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every state that's legalized has
it allowed for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason for that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm convinced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what is it's an important one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In court, when local jurisdictions are
sued by a business owner who wants to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in a county or a city that's
placed a ban, the local jurisdiction has
[SPEAKER_00]: two arguments when they go to court.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, let Ferguson guide with
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initiative does preempt our usual
authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to what Ferguson said.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our usual authority, whatever we
want, and that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they say in the alternative,
if that's wrong, if Ferguson is wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: the initiative does preclude us from
banning the sale of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an alternative argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alternative argument is, well,
look at the federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the federal law, they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal law is pretty clear on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal law preempts state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one thing, if you get to that
argument, and no court's gotten that
[SPEAKER_00]: argument yet because they've all agreed
that I'm right, that local jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_00]: can ban sale of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no court's had to reach the argument of
whether or not federal law preempts state
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's interesting about that is if
you get to that argument, if a court
[SPEAKER_00]: thinks, or a state screen court thinks,
and hopefully this will go to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supreme Court and you can decide for
yourselves how comfortable you view the U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supreme Court to sign this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does federal law preempt state law?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would just be a local ban.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an existential threat to
legalization of marijuana, not just in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, but all across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you avoid that conversation
for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supreme Court is if each state allows for
local bans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhat ironic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ironically, local bans actually,
mind you, preserve the legalization of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any state goes forward and says,
no, you've got to do it, it's only a
[SPEAKER_00]: matter of time before that issue of
whether federal law and state law ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: squarely before the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supreme Court, it would be inevitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that was not a reason for our
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just looking at the initiative and
the language of the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has the language been clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: All local jurisdictions must ban the sale
of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have said that in the answer,
but it does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those cases got to our state
screen court yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually somewhat surprised that
they've been bouncing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this issue may end up a local ban
before our state screen court.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would just say is it's not
unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like California, I just read an article
this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: States provide that, and I'm convinced
there's a reason why they specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: provide that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to wrap up, before Donald Trump
became president, actually, before Donald
[SPEAKER_00]: Trump became president, if you ask me what
single issue I spend the most time as
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney general thinking about,
it would have been marijuana legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it impacts so much of state
government, such importance to people,
[SPEAKER_00]: so high profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Media is interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just a big, big, big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other AGs are asking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big, big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the few issues I would say
where I would literally receive regular
[SPEAKER_00]: memos updating me on court actions around
the state and issues with state government
[SPEAKER_00]: and the liquor in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with Trump becoming president,
obviously this year there's been a big
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on our litigation with the
president.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that the issue of
marijuana legalization, my team knows this
[SPEAKER_00]: is critical to me personally and I think
to our office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to do everything in our
power and everything in my power to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: the goal of voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, that's our job.
[SPEAKER_00]: B, I think it's the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: C, I think we'll win.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll win.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think part of it is that I felt we were
most vulnerable the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we were most vulnerable the
first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thankful that President Obama and Eric
Holder held their respective offices the
[SPEAKER_00]: first year we legalized marijuana instead
of visiting the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think things could have been different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just mechanic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that we had those five years
to come forward, other states have come on
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listed some of them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only going in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have this conference in five
years, there'll be a lot more states in 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years, more states still.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we're going to find a way
forward to allow the goal of voters to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for giving us a chance to
say a few words.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
