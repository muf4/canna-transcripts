[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to a lot of Roots reggae when I
was in my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a stoner in school generally meant
that there was a lot of reggae around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my early 20s, I discovered the band
Israel Vibration specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many other bands in the Roots
reggae genre, but for me, Israel Vibes is
[SPEAKER_00]: the quintessential Roots band.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel Vibration embodies the essence of
Roots reggae through their messages of
[SPEAKER_00]: spirituality, social consciousness,
and liberation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their use of rich melodies, uplifting
chord progressions, and melodic horn
[SPEAKER_00]: arrangements further contribute to their
quintessential Roots reggae sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They address themes such as African
identity, Babylonian system criticism,
[SPEAKER_00]: the struggle of the oppressed,
and the importance of faith and
[SPEAKER_00]: perseverance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel Vibration's lyrics resonate with
the poetic nature of Roots reggae,
[SPEAKER_00]: encapsulating the struggles and hopes of
the Jamaican people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surely, I listened to lots of the popular
reggae at the time, and these themes imbue
[SPEAKER_00]: most reggae, but I didn't understand the
authentic roots and meaning of reggae in
[SPEAKER_00]: my soul until I listened to Israel
Vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, we can talk about the
importance of cannabis roots, a thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere and root zone, and the love of
a thick mass of healthy plant roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But only when we really lean into Roots
culture, cannabis roots science,
[SPEAKER_00]: will we have both the heart and the
knowledge to grow our best cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_00]: ever.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is plant biologist Sarah
Lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah Lane is wrapping up her PhD in plant
and cellular biology at University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Victoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her work primarily focuses on root
exudates that are involved in iron uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: in plants and their potential medical
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah consults for licensed cannabis
cultivators in Canada and is an avid
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil cannabis home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to her university research needs,
she is also very experienced in fog ponics
[SPEAKER_00]: and hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah has a wicked large plant collection
and is currently designing a specialty
[SPEAKER_00]: terrarium for growing cloud orchids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah Lane appeared on Shaping Fire 99
just a few episodes back talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiotic relationship between roots and
other residents in the root zone via
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set today, we will look
at how roots and root hairs are created,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they absorb nutrients, the exudate
relationship and how different fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: impact the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second set is devoted to root
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will look at the various forms of root
structure in soil, cocoa and hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and why they work and don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will look at the relationship between
root structure and the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will discuss how various growing
containers impact root structure and what
[SPEAKER_00]: that means for your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we will finish off with a
discussion of best practices for growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and thriving root structure,
including water, pH, soil amendments and
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't usually ask guests back
right away, but our discussion of root
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates during episode 99 just brought up
so many root related questions for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the comments online that I
just knew that it was probably better to
[SPEAKER_00]: just invite you back right away and push
forward into our discussion of roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for making the time to come back
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to start out with some
basics because it's become pretty obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years of taking questions from
audience members and the people who I talk
[SPEAKER_00]: with at conventions that there's a lot of
us in cannabis cultivation that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: take roots for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to start with some
basics of what are roots and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the ultra basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are roots made of and how are they
formed by the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So roots are basically an organ of the
plant that are made up of a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a vascular tissue to help
transport water and nutrients up into the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's surrounded by some other tissues that
can kind of respond to the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an epidermis layer that kind of
acts like a skin around the whole thing to
[SPEAKER_02]: prevent like microbes and things like that
from getting in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the purpose of a root is basically to
provide anchorage so that the plant stays
[SPEAKER_02]: put and can survive wind and all that kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also for getting nutrients into
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is that there are
different types of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the primary roots, the big chunky
parts that we can see, but then they seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to have smaller and smaller branching
roots all the way down to the root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many different flavors of roots are
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so many flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also depends on the type of species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very broadly, the type of root system
that you can have depends on what species
[SPEAKER_02]: you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for most angiosperms,
so those are the flowering plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: they get split up into roots that can form
from a taproot and then roots that are
[SPEAKER_02]: fibrous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a taproot basically just means that
the plant will make one big long root that
[SPEAKER_02]: goes down and lots of roots will come off
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A fibrous root system is closer to the
stem and they're not as long, they're kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of just lots and lots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also many other plants that
don't even have a true root system that
[SPEAKER_02]: have root-like structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we get into just a regular
root ball that we're familiar with,
[SPEAKER_02]: so like a houseplant root ball,
for example, there's the primary root,
[SPEAKER_02]: but these can get split up into other like
branching lateral roots that kind of move
[SPEAKER_02]: away from the root into other parts of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, you can have,
I guess root hairs would be the next
[SPEAKER_02]: option.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a single celled little root
hair that sits at just a very short amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of distance from the root itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that helps kind of pull up some more
nutrients in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that taproot for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we are talking about the roots
specifically for our favorite cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you know, it comes up all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will say this just kind of off the
cuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will say, you know, they prefer to
grow from seed because they want to grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant with a taproot because when we clone
cannabis plants, the clones when we plant
[SPEAKER_00]: them don't have taproots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a particular reason why clones
don't have taproots?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the function of the taproot in
a seed plant that we are missing out on
[SPEAKER_00]: when we grow a clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that's a really interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess when we talk about the types of
root systems that a plant can have,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are usually referring to like a
developmental thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant when it's in a seed is
programmed to have a taproot root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we clone, we're actually taking
advantage of almost a wound healing
[SPEAKER_02]: response instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant has the ability to make cells
that wouldn't normally be roots turn into
[SPEAKER_02]: roots to help it survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that isn't necessarily how it was
developmentally designed to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we go to the taproot, when you
grow from a seed, that taproot goes as far
[SPEAKER_02]: down as possible to get as deep as
possible into the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the advantage to like having a very
long taproot is that if you can go like
[SPEAKER_02]: meters and meters down into the soil and
then produce lateral roots from there,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you can access so much more of the of
the ground to get your nutrients from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have like a really short
taproot, then you're probably like if you
[SPEAKER_02]: can only go four inches down, you're only
able to access that much of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you grow from a clone,
I don't think it truly matters in the long
[SPEAKER_02]: run because we're usually growing in pots
and pots like even if you have a taproot
[SPEAKER_02]: system, you can only get to the bottom of
the pot and then you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: branching out from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from a clone's perspective,
like you wouldn't have if you were growing
[SPEAKER_02]: out in like a field, you wouldn't have
access to that same depth of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be harder for you to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to push on this one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the perspective that you shared
about how a clone rooting itself is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like a recovery or a first aid event
because it's been damaged and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: repurposing other dare I say stem cells,
but no different cells in the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: create this root environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the plant get stabilized and kind of
shake off that damaged first aid kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: living bias and like become a thriving
plant or will a clone forever be hobbled
[SPEAKER_00]: by the fact that it wasn't from seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I, I love both.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two things I want to talk about
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So absolutely plants can recover quite
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about it, they have to,
they don't have feet like we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't just like wander over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of their like responses,
they're constantly adapting to new
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it was one damage later,
one damage event, like say they got
[SPEAKER_02]: flooded or something and then they can't
recover.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't survive very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like any wound or anything like that
that you can do usually, as long as you
[SPEAKER_02]: treat it properly and it comes back to a
healthy environment, you should be totally
[SPEAKER_02]: able to recover, which is often why many,
many different types of plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetatively propagated, including like
potatoes and all sorts of other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the idea of a stem cell plants do
actually have the ability for so many of
[SPEAKER_02]: their cells to become stem cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike us where we just have this little
tiny amount of stem cells when we're born.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a couple of pockets of it,
of stem cells in our body that can react
[SPEAKER_02]: in certain ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants, almost any cell can become a stem
cell that will then be able to be any
[SPEAKER_02]: other part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why tissue culture works so
brilliantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that I stumbled into that
brilliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I didn't realize that was the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to make a pun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a stem cell, but it's also a stem
cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so let's talk a little bit about
the roots job of bringing in nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we talked about
in the Exodate show that I found so
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting is all of the different ways
that roots, um, mechanize bringing in
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, on shaping fire,
we tend to focus on living soil solutions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we'll definitely be covering,
you know, all other types of substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: today, especially since we're talking
about roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this question, what are the forms
of various nutrients that roots can
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb, assuming that they are in thriving
living soil environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm assuming that they're gonna,
they're gonna absorb like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like minerals in one certain way and
maybe fungus in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get what I think you understand
what I'm asking.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I understand what you're asking
correctly, um, how do roots take on
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of nutrients in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there, there's a bunch of different
things when we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess all nutrients at the end of the
day can be broken down into nitrogen or
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus ions, or like, like basically a
salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happens either because the plant
is able to provide some sort of,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, chemical or enzymatic process that can
break something down right next to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: or because some bacteria or fungus next to
it was able to do the same thing and they
[SPEAKER_02]: can take it up that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some evidence that plants can
take up nutrients as slightly larger
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules, but I think this is very
species dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think all plants can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or at least I'm not familiar with
enough, uh, papers that have shown this to
[SPEAKER_02]: be kind of a universal thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it comes to like bacteria or
mycorrhizae or those kinds of things,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's more of a conversation between
the, the organism and the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that involves some chemical signaling
and some invitations are sent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the plant is able to repurpose
the structure of the root to house it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not necessarily that it's actually
getting into the cell, more like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: getting a special place in the root to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, your answer, uh, is, seems to suggest
that, you know, another good reason that
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're going to be growing in soil,
it really behooves us to try to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: thriving and varied, um, you know,
living root zone, because if the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves are not necessarily breaking
these different, uh, nutrition's down and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's their partnership with bacteria and
other types of microbes, all those friends
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the ways that, you know,
all the ways that we try to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: thriving root zone and not, and not drown
them with our water is all important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the, if the root zone is going to be
able to have the buffet that we want them
[SPEAKER_00]: to have in their living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more vibrant that community is,
the better, um, nutrition is available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, a lot of the microbes
that are found in the soil provide other
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits aside from nutrition,
like competition against, um, pathogens,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, if you have a lot of healthy
bacteria down there, then there's less
[SPEAKER_02]: room for, uh, an unhealthy bacteria to
show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it might just be stimulating the plant
to make little immune compounds because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're there and they don't react
strongly to that particular fungus,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're aware of fungus is there and
they might be more ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's so many things that they
provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know that you do a lot of aeroponics
and so this, um, this may be an unfair
[SPEAKER_00]: question to ask you specifically for
living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not looking for us to like plug
any manufacturers, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as somebody who is constantly looking at
ways to create healthier and more thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, as you do in your research,
um, are there any inoculants or particular
[SPEAKER_00]: teas or anything that you would recommend
for living soil people to help support
[SPEAKER_00]: this, uh, thriving rhizosphere?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, so for my research,
I'm generally trying to avoid the,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the presence of bacteria as best as
possible because I'm really trying to just
[SPEAKER_02]: get at the root, but I do use compost teas
a lot when, um, when I'm growing at home
[SPEAKER_02]: and I, I usually, I don't know,
in places where you can get them,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's like a nettle, horsetail,
bracken fern tea that you can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them have molasses bases,
which is really helpful to get certain
[SPEAKER_02]: types of bacteria and fungus to get
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like so many good recipes online
to be hard to plug just one, but if you,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you go and, and have a look at some
compost tea recipes, I think the simplest
[SPEAKER_02]: ones are the best, like a little bit of
soil that's healthy, plus some sugar
[SPEAKER_02]: sources, plus some plants is usually a
good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus in the one that you mentioned,
I mean, you've got the, the, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: the silica from the horsetail and the,
the growth hormones from the spring
[SPEAKER_00]: nettles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a pretty potent mix you
just suggested too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the other one I would say too is,
um, it depends on the stage that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: adding it because I will often,
when I have very young plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do like a barley tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you soak barley for a little while and,
um, all the different growth factors that
[SPEAKER_02]: allow the barley to sprout are then
present in the liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can either buzz it up or you can
take the liquid off and put it on young
[SPEAKER_02]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, it, it's thought to help grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you, when you were back recently,
uh, or back when you were here the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time recently on episode 99, that show was
all about exudates, um, which is a,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a process that the roots bring on,
uh, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now granted that's an hour and a half
episode that we talked about exudates and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask you to summarize it just
in, you know, in, in a short answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I think it's important that
folks understand that roots do have this
[SPEAKER_00]: exudate relationship because it's pretty
bad ass, but I'll, I'll, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my goal was maybe to hopefully to tease
people with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they understand kind of what
you're talking about for this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then to encourage them to go back and
listen to episode 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you just briefly, uh, explain how,
um, cannabis roots, uh, work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: exudate relationship?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So broadly speaking, exudates are,
um, molecules that the plant root will
[SPEAKER_02]: make that goes outside of the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, it's, so it's made inside the
root.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's exported outside the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it, while it's out there,
it can do lots of different jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can provide food for microbial
communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can help to loosen up some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like we were just talking about
breakdown nutrients and things like that
[SPEAKER_02]: nearby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can provide some protective,
um, efforts too, to prevent, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it could be anti-microbial or
anti-fungus idle or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it, they're, they're just a huge
broad range of, of molecules that do this
[SPEAKER_02]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, uh, go back and listen to episode
99 for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so I'm really curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we, we've already talked about how
the, um, the roots, uh, take on,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, nutrition and, um, and I believe
that mostly happens at the root hair
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you explain to us, um, in,
in, you know, kind of both a chemical and
[SPEAKER_00]: a mechanical way, what's actually
happening there at the root hair that
[SPEAKER_00]: allows the nutrition to come on board
inside of the root?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think for the root hair,
it still kind of comes across the way that
[SPEAKER_02]: it would come across in a lot of other,
um, cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're talking about transport from
inside or sorry, from outside the,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the soil environment into the root,
all cells are wrapped up in this nice
[SPEAKER_02]: little membrane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has, essentially you could think of
them as like little trap doors,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, for nutrients to come into the root
that are regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd have to turn on a switch for them
to come in and that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: All, all cells are doing this all the time
and that is no different in a root hair
[SPEAKER_02]: cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big advantage to root hairs is it's
increasing absorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think of like, think of how big
a root is and how visible it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually depending on how long the
plant's been growing, it can be super
[SPEAKER_02]: thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, whereas these root hairs are super,
super tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so while the main root can plow
through the soil at a pretty good clip,
[SPEAKER_02]: the little root hairs are meant to kind of
slide in between soil particles and
[SPEAKER_02]: increase the surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of their primary purpose is
to, is to increase the absorption rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when plants are trying to choose what
kind of doors they want on their cells,
[SPEAKER_02]: the root hairs will often have a lot of,
um, like for my work, I'm interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: how iron gets in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those root hairs can have more iron
doors on them so that more iron can get in
[SPEAKER_02]: on those root hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that trap door analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's all these different flavors
and they only open when they are looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for the particular nutrient that
approaches it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a, like a secret knock or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little handshake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, cannabis cultivators often
come into contact with the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes just briefly when
transplanting, but other times if the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is root bound in a container,
um, you know, we might be really
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive with the roots, like grabbing
them and ripping them and thinking that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting rid of tired roots that were
compacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and most people will say,
oh, I'm stimulating new growth by pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: these, uh, these, um, you know,
roots that were compacted off and giving
[SPEAKER_00]: it more room to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: How careful should we be when handling the
roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because on one hand, you know,
because I learned it from my mentor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the ripping apart of the roots like
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what I was taught,
but I also constantly hear from soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biologists that, that the roots are very
sensitive and we can put the plant into
[SPEAKER_00]: shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming that the truth of the
matter is somewhere in that range.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think it's wrong to think that
you are stimulating growth because just
[SPEAKER_02]: like we were talking about earlier with
the clone and, and how that's a wound
[SPEAKER_02]: healing response that it makes more roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you damage the roots, that is
definitely something a plant will respond
[SPEAKER_02]: to and it will make more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more about like hoping you don't
damage it so much that the plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like roots are very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as soon as you take them out of the
pot, they're being exposed to light.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't expecting you're touching
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those finer structures,
like the root hairs that are so,
[SPEAKER_02]: so small and fragile, like they're only a
single cell thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you're, you're definitely
destroying those and it will definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: take the plant some time to recover from
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it, it depends on the type of
plant that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, specifically cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's going to be a certain amount
of cannabis plants that are very sturdy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there might also be more sensitive
plants that maybe don't grow as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean specific, like what we call
strains or varieties, not different
[SPEAKER_00]: species entirely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like, I grow a lot of plants,
so I would say species too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we're talking strictly about
cannabis, different cultivars are
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely going to have different vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in a plant that has a lot of vigor,
you're probably okay to maybe manhandle
[SPEAKER_02]: the pot a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in a plant that's very sensitive and
doesn't grow that well, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: trickier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think most of the time I would,
I would say that unless the roots are dead
[SPEAKER_02]: or diseased, I would try and keep them
intact as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can break them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you encounter, particularly with
hardwalled pots, sometimes you see the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots kind of run around in a big circle.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can kind of try and loosen them
up so that they'll not break them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like try and kind of untangle them a
little bit so they might go somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluff them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I try and be as gentle as possible
with my root balls, but yeah, it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to happen regardless.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just the extent that it happens,
you might have to be careful with some
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars over others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be fair to say that if we're
growing from seed and we have a taproot,
[SPEAKER_00]: we definitely shouldn't mess with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, if we're going to,
if we're going to trim roots, trim,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, secondary roots, don't be
touching the taproot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's probably fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know enough about what happens if
the taproot gets super damaged,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it would produce a new taproot and
like how that developmentally would occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it like, because it does serve
this different function than the other
[SPEAKER_02]: roots that if you damage it too much,
it will cause changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know whether those changes
would be good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it would be fair to intuit
that, you know, a damage to a taproot
[SPEAKER_00]: would put, you know, extra undue stress on
the plant that it would have to bounce
[SPEAKER_00]: back from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we're all dealing with a timed
growing cycle that none of us want,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of us want to cause that slowdown in
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our, for our plant, we should
probably just stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this actually is a good point
that you're bringing up the whole time
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have like a mother plant that's
meant to be in vegetative growth for a
[SPEAKER_02]: very long time and it'll never get flipped
over into flower, you might have different
[SPEAKER_02]: choices to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, it gets root bound because
it's growing so long and maybe you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of have to do some pruning
above and then some pruning below.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, those are choices you would have
to make with a, with a mother plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: how much or how little you do of it would
probably again, depend on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're dealing with like a plant
that's about to go into flower and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: only got a certain amount of time,
that's where you really don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: damage the roots too much because they
don't have enough time and all the time
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's going to spend recovering is
time that's not necessarily going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: put towards yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in like a, in a yield situation,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely don't want to be,
you know, making that plant suffer too
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great delineation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what biology determines if the roots,
you know how like when you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant, when you, when you pull it out
of the pot, sometimes it's got those like
[SPEAKER_00]: bright white, like pearly white teeth,
beautiful roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then sometimes it'll be
like, you know, somewhere between a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more beige or gray, and then you've got
roots that are just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, is it just our guesstimate that,
that the white roots are the most
[SPEAKER_00]: thriving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the ideal or are lots of different
roots of different colors, perhaps just
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I see the bright white roots,
I'm all like, hell yeah, I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and when I see the beige ones,
I'm like, oh, I'm not, I'm not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, treating this pot right in some
way, but like, I, I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just made that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the roots, like all of the root is
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love seeing those little white root tips
and in aeroponic, sometimes they're a
[SPEAKER_02]: little fuzzy because of those little,
little hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're adorable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they only occur usually pretty close
to the root tip because then they die off
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the plant has other, like,
that's where you might see a lateral root
[SPEAKER_02]: form or something passed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the white tips are the actively growing
parts of the root, which I think is why we
[SPEAKER_02]: love them so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, yay, we've got a lot of
white growing areas, but the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots still super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the browning isn't necessarily because
of bad things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So oftentimes what will happen is
different chemistry happens at the tip of
[SPEAKER_02]: the root compared to the older root.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants might put down, for example,
more tannins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or protective molecules that, that will
change the color of the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's because the function of the
older root is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that kind of makes some sense to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we see those kinds of Browner
roots at the, at the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: closer to the stem, that's just because
the function has started shifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the chemistry of the root has
started shifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, it would be hard to pinpoint
exactly what is happening there for a
[SPEAKER_02]: given cultivar, but that's generally
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones where it's scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is when there is a black root tip,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if that black, black or dark Browner
or those kinds of colors are happening at
[SPEAKER_02]: the very tip of the root, particularly in
cannabis, cause it's root tips are white.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do work with some plants that have a
whole bunch of different colors happen
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in cannabis specifically, the white
tip, if that's starting to Brown or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything like that, you might have a
bacterial problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it just depends on where it's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's say not quite as bad as that
black tipped pathogen version,
[SPEAKER_00]: which sounds like a horror movie to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there, is there any way for us to
identify roots during transplanting that
[SPEAKER_00]: we should shave off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, historically I would
shave off a bunch of those beige ones if I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I know that that was probably not
well thought because perhaps the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: creating tannins in those regions for,
you know, safety and security reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just like cut them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, is there any way for us to recognize
roots that are, are a damaged part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: system that should be shaved off?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can kind of think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the other part is there's a
connection between the roots and the
[SPEAKER_02]: shoots where like there's usually certain
roots that service particular parts of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant above.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really hard for us like looking in
the pot as we're trying to transplant to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to determine like, oh,
this branch I cut off here are these roots
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these ones can go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it is a bit of guesswork.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like if they're, if they're like
particularly dry looking, like they're
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of shriveled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when a, when a root is like full of
water, they're kind of, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: the best word to describe it would be,
but they're almost like plump,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like they, they have,
they have like kind of a juicy look.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're unhealthy or dead,
oftentimes they'll be quite thin,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a thread almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe like the thready ones you can
get rid of a little bit more easily,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is a lot of it's guesswork.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have a firm answer for you as
to which part would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually for myself, I look for as a,
as we were just talking about kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: the brown or root tips that might be
experiencing some bacterial effects or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but there can be good, good bacterial
effects too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I generally just try and do my best
guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had a better answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that actually is pretty good because
what I took from it is that if you see
[SPEAKER_00]: roots that are particularly emaciated and
they visually look thin and like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not carrying water that perhaps those can
be removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, we want everything
in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't see like a black or colorful
tip on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just give, give your roots a light
fluff and then go into the bigger pot and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just don't think you have to touch the
roots when you're transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't assume that that's going to be part
of your transplanting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only do it if, if you actually see visual
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a pretty fair statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, or at least that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know lots of people have different
philosophies and what the best solution
[SPEAKER_02]: is, but I think for getting your plants to
recover quickly from transplant,
[SPEAKER_02]: like as little damage as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as, as you say, like if they look
emaciated and they're really sad looking
[SPEAKER_02]: roots, like maybe trim those off,
but otherwise a little fluff will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the, one of the
interesting, you said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's got their own philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you know, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are, there are different ways to
have different philosophies within actual
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think when it comes to cannabis,
we've all been taught so much like bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science by our mentors and then from
friends that, um, like if, if anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: should be decreasing the number of
justifiable philosophies, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's our community because we have so much
bad information to root out of our
[SPEAKER_00]: community first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once all that bad information is
gone, then people can like find different
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of, of, you know, that the remaining
area to, you know, count as their
[SPEAKER_00]: particular technique or philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I dunno, I kind of, I kind of
think that, that, that we, we haven't had
[SPEAKER_00]: access to proper science, scientists,
analytics and research folks for the last,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 40 years that, um, that,
you know, us all trying to kind of bring
[SPEAKER_00]: the techniques all towards the center,
which has actually got a scientific basis
[SPEAKER_00]: is probably a pretty good set for all of
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, um, I think that there's,
there's all these little habits that we do
[SPEAKER_02]: that we don't really question and those I
like to question myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and as you say, there's a lot of myths
and legends about exactly what type of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing you should do at what time and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's a lot of tried and true
methods that have worked for people for a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I do agree that bringing things
around to like a scientific perspective
[SPEAKER_02]: and not just doing it because someone told
you to do it, um, which is kind of ironic
[SPEAKER_02]: to me giving advice about this,
but you know, like think about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I've got two more questions before
we go to the break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the, in the third set, we're going
to be talking a lot about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the care and feeding of a thriving root
structure so that we can have the best one
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, but before we go to the set
break, I want to talk about things that
[SPEAKER_00]: degrade root growth and, uh, two,
two different categories specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there particular amendments,
inputs or fertilizers that can degrade
[SPEAKER_00]: root growth that we should avoid in
cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a, this is a more of a
conversation of amount or like what the
[SPEAKER_02]: state is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause this can happen when you're building
a soil, but it can also happen when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it's too, I guess, quote unquote,
hot is the term that we end up throwing
[SPEAKER_02]: around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the time I would argue it's
because, um, particularly with
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizers, it's probably because of pH
or something like that, where it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just, the poor little root is
getting flooded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it also happens more with,
um, certain limiting nutrients like
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen, where the plant is less,
um, less able to close the trap door.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, nitrogen is almost always
like all the trap doors are open all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time because there's not enough of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you flood your root system with too
much nitrogen, it builds up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way that plants convert what we
feed them to a usable form of nitrogen to
[SPEAKER_02]: them, all the intermediates between
fertilizer and usable nitrogen are toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll start killing the cells off if
there's too much of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think with soil, if it's not
well mixed, um, it can actually heat up in
[SPEAKER_02]: not just hot as in like too much
nutrients, but as in like temperature hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and obviously if your roots are too
hot, zone is like 60, 70, 80 degrees,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have a hard time surviving
in those kinds of conditions too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like your example about if,
if we have too much fertilizer in a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular place that it kind of,
um, jams the trap doors open and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: force feeds the plant to its detriment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's the same description that
people, um, use when describing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bottled salt nutrients about how
it force feeds the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at the root level is that the,
um, the, the, you know, the synthetically
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared, um, fertilizer is essentially
breaking down the doors and, and going
[SPEAKER_00]: into the roots, um, more nutrition than
the root zone would normally let in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So especially with it, I think it's more
dangerous with, um, with like synthetic or
[SPEAKER_02]: bottled fertilizers because it's so
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's in such an available form,
the plant doesn't have to do any work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just does flood into the root
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as, um, as I was just mentioning it,
like, it's not so much that the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: itself is toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the, in order to be able to turn it
into something usable, it goes through a
[SPEAKER_02]: toxic stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the roots can't, it's just too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't do that process quick enough to
avoid all the toxic effects of that
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually can happen with really rich
composts too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, I think as a, at least in my
personal opinion, it's harder to do
[SPEAKER_02]: because a lot of those composts still need
some breaking down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little bit slower, but if you
dump like pure compost at the root zone of
[SPEAKER_02]: a particularly sensitive plant that isn't
capable of taking it all up, it'll start
[SPEAKER_02]: to do similar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, the last one is how about
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, sure, we, we apply the
pesticides usually fully or up top,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we know that through, you know,
watering and then just the regular biology
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants, either the pesticides will
drip down to the soil or the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: take it in and move those chemicals,
um, you know, whether or not they be
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic or, you know, organic,
they're going to move them around the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, are there any pesticides that we would
want to avoid because they too degrade
[SPEAKER_00]: root growth?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have a personal bias against
this cause I don't generally like to use
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that when you apply, I guess it
depends, very much on the type of
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide you're referring to,
cause a lot of them have toxic effects if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're in too high of a quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually can be both the naturally
sourced ones and also the synthetically
[SPEAKER_02]: prepared ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you put too much mint oil on your
plants and turn the lights on,
[SPEAKER_02]: like those, those poor little guys are
fried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but with the pesticides, like on,
they're still able to take some up through
[SPEAKER_02]: the foliar system, but depending on what
mechanism the pesticide is supposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: work by, um, I don't know if it would
degrade the root particularly,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it might have the ability to affect
the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it's acting like a growth
regulator or, um, or it's got a heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: metal component to it or something like
that, I'm sure that it can be taken up by
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it doesn't have a way to deal with
it and it's toxic in higher quantities,
[SPEAKER_02]: that will probably happen in the plant,
just like it would in any other system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep on coming back to balance,
you know, it's like, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you've got a lot of different options
for how to cultivate your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whichever one you do, do it properly
and not so much that you knock your root
[SPEAKER_00]: system out of balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I think particularly with
pesticides, I don't know if I would be
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I'm not personally aware of any
pesticide that if you watered it in at the
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts that you would spray it,
it would cause a huge amount of damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you did that, you'd probably be
killing it above as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it might affect the root community
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're adding an antimicrobial or
an antifungal, uh, agent to the top and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it drips into the roots, I think
you'd be affecting the root community more
[SPEAKER_02]: than you'd be affecting the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which of course does affect the plant
eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be careful with that myself
because one of my favorite, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, well, I think of it as a pesticide,
but really it's, it's more about,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, discouraging pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I really like a, uh, a garlic
fermented plant juice on, on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, sprayed foliar during,
uh, during vets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, no, no, like aphids is my
big problem where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't want to live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like, they don't like the
experience for, you know, whatever smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: taste reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but, but if, if I put too much of
that onto the plant and it soaks down into
[SPEAKER_00]: the substrate, well, garlic also has
antimicrobial, um, uh, aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I don't want that happening in
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think it, as you say,
it's, it's about a balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you, if you just have to be careful,
especially when you're trying to alter
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's happening to the plant in
a way that doesn't affect the plant too,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just gets, you know, it's sometimes
it's subtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the more we get into the cultivation
specifics, uh, it is more and more subtle,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, when you first start growing
cannabis, it's like, Oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just put the seed in the ground and it
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end you got some weed,
but then you like want more yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: better weed and healthier plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to keep more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the subtleties come as,
as we get, you know, more and more in love
[SPEAKER_00]: with this, uh, way to express ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is plant biologist,
Sarah Lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, without these advertisers,
shaping fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know
you heard about them on shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert has the beneficial insects,
mites and nematodes, microbials,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky cards, and air distribution units.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to partner with nature to defend
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_00]: from chemical sprays towards clean and
natural solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1967, Copert has assisted growers in

[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options in who to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_00]: ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend Gaslamp Seeds to my friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners who are looking for a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably already know Gaslamp Seeds as
Hembra Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hembra recently changed their name to
Gaslamp Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp Seeds is not just another seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp is a female operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: With over 60 breeders and over a thousand
strains to choose from, you will certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: find something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp Seeds has something for everyone
with over 650 feminized strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 regular varieties, and over 200 auto
flowers to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Names you know you can trust like Compound
Genetics, Humboldt Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Owl, In-House, FastBuds,
Gnome Automatics, and Ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money but have no
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited Gaslamp to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_00]: about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have A plus customer service with
lightning fast response times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will get
your order out the same day you place it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most seed banks are simply not this
organized or interested in getting your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to you so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Gaslamp Seeds cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even get free seeds with every order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helene and Caitlin get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been in the cannabis growing
scene for over a decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want some extra freebies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the code SHAPINGFIRE all one word at
checkout and they will give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: additional set of Gaslamp provided
freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an extra $30 in free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy seeds from good folks who will send
you great seeds reliably every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit gaslampseeds.com today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Gaslamp Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard me talk about the
award-winning cannabis seeds that come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the analytical breeding program of
Seth and Eric Crawford who founded Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Seth was a guest on Shaping Fire
in 2020 to talk about triploid genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC
seeds for home growers and farms as Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the Revolution Seeds at gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their high THC seeds are extraordinary in
that they will start to flower at 16 and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half hours of daylight instead of the
typical 14 and a half hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means in most regions your plants
will start to flower outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of July instead of the middle of
August.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means these photo period plants
finish in September and not October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally upending the photo period seed
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric took their prized early
flowering CBG line and bred it to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most desired verified genetics out
there including Sour Diesel, Triangle
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, Wedding Cake, Chem Dogs,
Skittles and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: These crosses all express powerful photo
period terpene profiles and THC giving you
[SPEAKER_00]: a great high.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTR seeds has a new THCV line with plants
like Double Durbin and Gigantor that boast
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one THC to THCV and people want
that THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTR seeds are very consistent true growing
inbred F1s from stabilized inbred parent
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds are nearly homogenous and the
plants should all grow the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only one phenotype in every pack
available as diploids and triploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric's company is still family
owned, patient and employee centric and
[SPEAKER_00]: partially powered by their two acres of
solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can purchase these seeds and the
entire catalog of Oregon CBD seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to gtrseeds.com today and choose
something revolutionary for your next
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor or outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, you are listening to Shaping
Fire, I am your host, Shango Los and my
[SPEAKER_00]: guest today is plant biologist Sarah Lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set we looked at what
exactly a root is and the jobs that it
[SPEAKER_00]: does and some things we want to avoid if
we want a thriving root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the second set we're gonna talk
more about the actual structure which is
[SPEAKER_00]: what the topic that was the genesis of me
asking Sarah to come back right away
[SPEAKER_00]: because during the Exodate show she got
into this explanation about how the root
[SPEAKER_00]: structure is different in coco coir and
peat non-soil or soilless containers than
[SPEAKER_00]: it is in living soil and I wanted to go
down that path but we just didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: time then and so here we are today and
we're gonna go down that in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sarah, let's start at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we use the phrase root structure what
specifically do we mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like when I think of root
structure I think about the root ball
[SPEAKER_02]: itself, the different components that make
up the root structure and how that differs
[SPEAKER_02]: between plants whether that be cultivar or
species or whatever and that's usually
[SPEAKER_02]: like how the different components might be
arranged whether they're present or
[SPEAKER_02]: absent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that would be something I would
call root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a typical cannabis plant what would
we expect the root structure to look like
[SPEAKER_00]: in soil like is there you know since since
in nature it's in soil I'll say that the
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil root structure is the air quotes
more natural one just for the for the time
[SPEAKER_00]: being just okay let me get away with that
and and so what would we expect root
[SPEAKER_00]: structure to look like in soil in the
ground outside?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay um well I mean we can stick with our
beautiful cannabis plant a nice big tap
[SPEAKER_02]: root goes straight down as far as it
possibly can grow um you can think of that
[SPEAKER_02]: like the vertical axis I guess and then
from that all these lateral roots start to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow that kind of stick out from the main
root and they go sideways so they're
[SPEAKER_02]: they're trying to like increase the
different places that the root can access
[SPEAKER_02]: and then from there there might be even
more little branches and more little
[SPEAKER_02]: branches and then at the growing tip of
the root there's a little tiny zone there
[SPEAKER_02]: where there's a bunch of little root hairs
that grow and they don't live for a hugely
[SPEAKER_02]: long time because that root is still
moving places and they so maybe like a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple weeks um but they're they're so
tiny we can barely see them with the naked
[SPEAKER_02]: eye and we definitely can't see how thin
they are because they're a single cell
[SPEAKER_02]: wide um but they they would be just in
like a little maybe I don't know a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: centimeters long zone right there and they
would kind of bush out into the into the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see diagrams of root structures of
different um types of plants um some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them go you know quickly really deep and
some stay at the top and then some will
[SPEAKER_00]: throw down like a tap root and then and
then and then the rest will stay at the
[SPEAKER_00]: stop at the top what is the architecture
of the the the root system in an adult
[SPEAKER_00]: plant are are they mostly up top where
they can support the plant from falling
[SPEAKER_00]: over and you know get uh rainwater or with
a cannabis plant are they all making this
[SPEAKER_00]: mad dash for depth uh in order to create
stability that way and get you know water
[SPEAKER_00]: that is in the soil or aquifer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um in in cannabis plants yes we talked
about this a little bit earlier like if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a clone it might not get as deep if
we're talking about like in soil uh
[SPEAKER_02]: because it doesn't necessarily have that
deep tap root to go driving down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom but in most cases like that tap
root it also anchors the plant as well
[SPEAKER_02]: because I mean I don't know if you've ever
tried to get up some of these weird little
[SPEAKER_02]: red carrot type weeds in your garden you
have to really yank on them like that tap
[SPEAKER_02]: roots deep and that plant is not falling
over for the most part so it does provide
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of anchorage um but I think like
what we're talking about diagrams and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that that we find like I think
most of the time it depends on species so
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis it's it's mostly going to be
on a tap root system that's going straight
[SPEAKER_02]: down and then it's there for water for
anchorage for all these different things
[SPEAKER_02]: but then all the lateral roots provide
support for whatever that purpose is so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of digging in there but also
increasing absorption the deeper the tap
[SPEAKER_02]: root too the more likely it is to survive
things like drought because it can access
[SPEAKER_02]: that groundwater layer whereas we find in
a lot of plants and here I'm not talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about cannabis specifically but a lot of
plants that make surface roots it's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually a very nutrient rich layer of the
soil where most of the organic matter sits
[SPEAKER_02]: so a lot of the lateral roots above are
meant to get nutrients specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not particularly good at getting
water because there's not a lot of water
[SPEAKER_00]: usually in that layer so earlier you
mentioned that um in um in container
[SPEAKER_00]: plants uh clearly the cannabis tap root
cannot go as deeply because it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be stopped by the bottom of the pot um
other than a tap root that doesn't go as
[SPEAKER_00]: deeply as it may like what other root
structure changes might we uh find in the
[SPEAKER_00]: the lateral and other root structures when
they are in a container versus when they
[SPEAKER_02]: are free flowing in the ground I think
mostly I think I would have to say length
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really dissected a like you know
removed all the soil to have a look but I
[SPEAKER_02]: would guess that because um and again it
does depend on the type of pot too so for
[SPEAKER_02]: example we use uh cloth-sided pots and
they're meant to be sort of like
[SPEAKER_02]: self-pruning so we don't get like running
roots and so for us we would end up
[SPEAKER_02]: probably seeing more and I'm speculating
here but I would expect to see more
[SPEAKER_02]: shorter lateral roots that are coming off
that main tap root um and and they
[SPEAKER_02]: probably wouldn't grow as much but there's
probably more branching and by branching I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean like lateral and then these little
roots branch off of that and some more
[SPEAKER_02]: roots branch off of that kind of exactly
the way a tree looks on top but below so
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens well you know what are the
effects of compaction on the root
[SPEAKER_00]: structure um you know we talked in the
first set about um how in a um a pot bound
[SPEAKER_00]: plant how the the roots run along the
sides but I would think that as a plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting more and more root bound that
there are other uh changes uh that happen
[SPEAKER_00]: in the root zone to deal with that
systemically yeah I mean when we when we
[SPEAKER_02]: look at like root bound plants like
oftentimes there's just not that much soil
[SPEAKER_02]: and and I mean I would expect the first
thing would be just like the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: properties change so you don't have as
much water retention um there's not as
[SPEAKER_02]: many um like when we talk about things
like cation exchange and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_02]: there might not be as many sites for that
to happen so that's basically the way that
[SPEAKER_02]: soil acts like a little kitchen cupboard
if you will um and there would be less
[SPEAKER_02]: kitchen cupboards available for nutrients
to be retrieved from and so most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: time when we have a super root bound plant
it's just that there's not enough physical
[SPEAKER_02]: space and soil to support that much plant
does that make sense yeah it's not so much
[SPEAKER_02]: that the root architecture itself may be
changing although it might it's more just
[SPEAKER_02]: it just can't support that much root in
that little space and so then the systems
[SPEAKER_00]: will start happening happening um and
efficiently and it'll essentially just
[SPEAKER_00]: fall out of balance and your plant will
get sick in one of many ways yeah and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: usually like I think the first thing I
noticed when when plants are too root
[SPEAKER_02]: bound is like it's just hard to keep them
fed and watered you have to water more
[SPEAKER_02]: often um I've had a couple of plants that
have actually almost pushed through the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottoms because I haven't had a chance to
get to them so the like they just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: push the pot out of the way um but it it
can get pretty bad and then you end up
[SPEAKER_02]: with a root ball that just can't sustain
the amount of shoot growth that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: um and then and then the plant just ends
up getting super deficient and if we
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to relate that to something like
yield I think your yield would be severely
[SPEAKER_02]: impacted because they just can't put that
much nutrients towards the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it's always a bad scene when you
find the plant that you forgot to
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant and it's got all the roots that
are coming out of the holes the drainage
[SPEAKER_00]: holes and you're like oh baby I'm so sorry
I didn't see you over there and and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know sometimes you get lucky and it was
sitting on something else and so now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's rerooted itself in like the pot under
it or something you know yeah which is
[SPEAKER_00]: which is always interesting but yeah
that's that's that's a bad day at the
[SPEAKER_00]: office when you find that you've neglected
a plant that bad because you know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have to cut those roots and that's
not gonna be a good day I've gotten pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: adept at pulling those roots out of holes
partly because of the way that I deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: my research plants um I need them to kind
of do that so um there's ways to untangle
[SPEAKER_02]: them very carefully but uh but that does
just go to show you how efficient plants
[SPEAKER_02]: are at seeking out nutrients like nothing
in this pot out we go we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere and we don't know where it is
but it will find something somewhere to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat yeah and you know that's a really good
point you know for for folks who are home
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who are you know growing two or
four or fifteen plants where every plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is important because they need to yield
their medicine for themselves um you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot more time to kind of you know
wiggle the plant back and forth and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know gingerly pull them up and try to save
as many of those roots versus you know in
[SPEAKER_00]: a in a scaled commercial or you know
medical environment where you've got you
[SPEAKER_00]: know a hundred or thousand plants where
you know you're just going to pull your
[SPEAKER_00]: your knife and go you know cut cut cut and
pull it out and transplant it and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a that's a very different kind of
of of cultivation but it is interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: how um the same problem has to be solved
different ways depending on the variety of
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation that you're doing absolutely
yeah yeah and I think it's it's something
[SPEAKER_02]: to mention too like like if you have the
time to try and save the roots I think it
[SPEAKER_02]: it helps we were talking earlier about
like how much root to lose and that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of stuff but the actively growing roots
are really the ones you want to try and
[SPEAKER_02]: save so I do my absolute best because
those little runners are probably the most
[SPEAKER_02]: active as they're trying to escape my poor
little pot situation so so this next
[SPEAKER_00]: question is the one that um that was that
was spun off in in episode 99 and the
[SPEAKER_00]: exudate so which is kind of the seed for
this episode which is um you know cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: and peat cultivation systems have become
like really popular over the years and I
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think still increasingly so and you
know in the in the beginning folks were
[SPEAKER_00]: using cocoa coir and peat to supplement
what we generally think of as living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: as a as an aeration and water retention
solution but nowadays people are just
[SPEAKER_00]: using cocoa and peat and they're not even
using um you know the living soil aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they are then they are adding
nutrition into these cocoa and peat pots
[SPEAKER_00]: with um you know whatever whatever kind of
fertilizer they choose from from compost
[SPEAKER_00]: teas to to amendments to to bottled stuff
so there's there's a lot of options with
[SPEAKER_00]: these these systems and you had mentioned
that a root structure is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: different in these types of pots and and
I'm super curious to hear what the
[SPEAKER_02]: differences are I guess that I guess when
we think of root structure we kind of have
[SPEAKER_02]: to back up and realize that the root
structure is kind of dictated by the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment and the needs of the plant so
like when we talk about whether plants
[SPEAKER_02]: make a lot of lateral roots or not like
they're going to make lateral roots but
[SPEAKER_02]: how many depends on things like nutrients
availability or oxygen presence absence
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of thing so in a soil that's
very mixed up there's like when you mix a
[SPEAKER_02]: good so like it's going to be
quote-unquote homogeneous to your eyes
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to make sure that like the
pearl lights in there evenly there's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: big clump and stuff like that but I don't
know on like a microscopic level it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: really there's little pockets and so
that's going to influence the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: because it has to move towards little
areas of nutrients in a system where the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients are actually homogeneous when
we're watering it in and we're not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily providing any other source the
plant's still going to be moving around in
[SPEAKER_02]: there but it might it might need to act
differently because it doesn't have that
[SPEAKER_02]: many different pockets in the in the soil
system and I think hydroponics is the most
[SPEAKER_02]: extreme of that because we can not only
can we really see the roots to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: them but there there's just one place that
all of these nutrients are and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: evenly available so I would expect to see
less branching and less root hairs and
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of thing that's interesting so
one of the one of the things we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about in the show a lot is how in a in a
in a living soil with a good fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that the fungus is you know
creating channels for the water to seep
[SPEAKER_00]: through and for the the roots to find
their ways through and it would be my
[SPEAKER_00]: expectation that in cocoa and pea systems
because there is less tiny particles of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil to fill in in between that a cocoa
and pea system will have a lot more air
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets and well I'm not don't want to
dwell on the air part but more like pads
[SPEAKER_00]: passages for the roots to follow do do you
find that in cocoa and pea systems the the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are are growing more willy-nilly
because they have so many more options
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of the fewer options that you
would find in a living soil system I guess
[SPEAKER_02]: it depends like I think I think the more
complex the soil system is the more
[SPEAKER_02]: complex the roots become because they're
just like I said they have to go
[SPEAKER_02]: adventuring for all of the things that
they need and it's not all immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: readily available I feel like with
aeration for example or like pockets like
[SPEAKER_02]: there there's probably other things and
whether you'd notice it if you just like
[SPEAKER_02]: pulled the two root systems up like you
might notice that if you count up the all
[SPEAKER_02]: the lateral roots or if you you know
measure the thickness of the root it might
[SPEAKER_02]: might change but I think it would be a lot
of chemistry would change too does that
[SPEAKER_00]: make sense yeah question yeah yeah and
then I'm gonna ask you a similar question
[SPEAKER_00]: but with two different varieties first
will be you know a hydroponic version
[SPEAKER_00]: where there is you know there is some kind
of cistern of water and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients there and the roots are growing
down into it and I guess this would work
[SPEAKER_00]: for an earth box too where the the the
roots are sitting in the the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: water how will the roots grow differently
in that kind of environment where they
[SPEAKER_00]: really don't have to travel at all to
access the nutrition I think they'd
[SPEAKER_02]: probably grow down more the one thing that
I've noticed the most at least in my own
[SPEAKER_02]: research is that the root hairs are
missing because they're so fragile and
[SPEAKER_02]: there might like if you took out a
microscope and did a little cross-section
[SPEAKER_02]: and did some fancy staining you might
still see like the starts of a root hair
[SPEAKER_02]: or the types of cells that could form a
root hair but when you actually look at
[SPEAKER_02]: roots that are grown in hydroponics
especially because there's a current and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that it doesn't really permit
those super fragile structures from
[SPEAKER_02]: showing up at least not macroscopically
like I can't see them with my eyes whereas
[SPEAKER_02]: like other systems they probably would be
present because they're not being
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbed as much do you think that that
impacts the thriving nature of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: or is it just like equal and different I I
lean towards equal and different because
[SPEAKER_02]: the purpose of a root hair is to increase
absorption and that's really important
[SPEAKER_02]: when we talk about like that super complex
soil mixture we were just discussing where
[SPEAKER_02]: you might need the extra absorption
because that little pocket of of minerals
[SPEAKER_02]: is just a little too far away for the the
chemistry of the main root to help and
[SPEAKER_02]: just needs like a little finger to go in
there and collect it and whereas in a
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponic system you're readily changing
the nutrients over you're readily
[SPEAKER_02]: providing it with what it needs and it
doesn't necessarily like it a regular root
[SPEAKER_02]: tip might be totally fine for absorbing
what's there I follow so the last one I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk about is aeroponics and you
know there are certainly not very many of
[SPEAKER_00]: us cultivating cannabis who have got adult
plants that are using aeroponics however
[SPEAKER_00]: it's incredibly common for folks to use
aeroponic cloners at the beginning of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's life so my question again is when
the plant is hanging but it is suspended
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not in it's not you know actually
submerged in the nutrient water it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually being sprayed with fine mist how
does that impact the root structure like
[SPEAKER_02]: for me I use even finer mist I use fog and
I notice quite a big difference like like
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant just doesn't need to go down as
much and I don't have empirical evidence
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's like particularly long or short
but for for my plants in aeroponics I find
[SPEAKER_02]: they kind of they're pretty bushy and
those root hairs are retained that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: big thing that I noticed there because the
fog is so gentle it's just like a little
[SPEAKER_02]: air current and you can actually see the
the root hairs come out but they also last
[SPEAKER_02]: longer because they're not getting moved
around in the soil or like this stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: so they do seem to increase absorption it
kind of makes sense when you're dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with a very gentle fog or mist because
it's not it's not as evenly distributed as
[SPEAKER_02]: a liquid would be because it's relying on
air currents to for delivery so I think
[SPEAKER_02]: the root hairs they tend to stay longer
and they're more important in in
[SPEAKER_02]: aeroponics there I think if you're
spraying like because you know what the
[SPEAKER_02]: grocery store high-pressure aeroponics
that keeps your lettuce wet yeah that mist
[SPEAKER_02]: might be enough to change the root hairs
depending on how fragile they are and what
[SPEAKER_02]: you know again cultivar species whatever
differences you want to talk about if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: being sprayed directly at the root you
might see less root hairs but if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: being sprayed into the chamber to increase
the humidity you might you might again see
[SPEAKER_02]: more root hairs that's a big noticeable
difference for me yeah right on the the
[SPEAKER_00]: the root structure in fogponic cannabis
plants is really incredible it really
[SPEAKER_00]: looks unlike anything else and you're
right it does look like you know this this
[SPEAKER_00]: this more compact shrubbery with with all
that these fine fine hairs it does look
[SPEAKER_00]: like its own animal do you have any
suggestions for folks who are are starting
[SPEAKER_00]: their clones in an arrow cloner but their
plan is to move them into a a cocoa peat
[SPEAKER_00]: or a um a living soil system because the
the root system that they have when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're being moved it's not designed for
that environment maybe you'll tell me it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't matter but I want to address that
one way or another I think it does we uh
[SPEAKER_02]: we kind of experience similar issues when
you're transferring from tissue culture
[SPEAKER_02]: too because it's a very specific
environment that the root has been growing
[SPEAKER_02]: in it's got a certain weight to it it's
got a certain um water content all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different things that can happen at the
root surface that it can sense it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be very different whether it's gel or
air or water or whatever you are using
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to the soil and so my my
suggestion would be that you know most of
[SPEAKER_02]: the times we fill a pot and we dig a
little hole and we put our plant in it my
[SPEAKER_02]: general suggestion would be don't do that
fill a little bit and then just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: hold the plant up and sort of like gently
fill it in that way so it can kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: retain that structure a bit more you still
have to be careful with like large air
[SPEAKER_02]: pockets you're going to have to gently
press down but I think that that would
[SPEAKER_02]: probably preserve the structure a little
better than just kind of smushing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: there don't jam it in there let it let it
hang of its own accord and then fill in
[SPEAKER_02]: around it yeah yeah I think that would
that would be the best way I think to
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve that very delicate sort of
structure and I don't have again like this
[SPEAKER_02]: is speculation I think it should provide
the root some support as you're filling it
[SPEAKER_02]: in um and I think it would cause less
damage it's still going to experience some
[SPEAKER_02]: differences compared to what it was
growing in so you might still see some
[SPEAKER_02]: damage um just just because it's not as
wet or it's having to adjust the type of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient acquisition it's doing like those
kind of things but hopefully that way the
[SPEAKER_02]: root architecture is preserved and I know
that's something I do with digit culture
[SPEAKER_02]: is I like I'll fill the pot three quarters
full and then I'll just kind of try and
[SPEAKER_02]: like fill in around it so that the roots
kind of supported from below before I
[SPEAKER_00]: start squishing it down all right so um
let's talk about um uh comparing a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of these different um uh substrates as far
as microbial life interaction goes so in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil most cultivators are looking for
complex micro systems so that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: thrives and is pest free and has a complex
terpene profile um and that happens
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is this burgeoning community
of life in the root zone in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere um however in in cocoa and pea
and in hydroponics were were were pouring
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition and in many cases were pouring
microbes in uh to the root zone but uh
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is not an established soil
community I kind of get the idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're kind of anything that we add is
just passing through um because there
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't uh a system to sustain life in those
other non-soil environments so um how how
[SPEAKER_00]: does this impact the experience of the
roots to thrive and to bring nutrition
[SPEAKER_00]: that the added microbes and nutrition are
not I guess I'll say residents of the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate but more that were were pouring
it in and it's there for a little while
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they're gone and then the roots
are waiting for us as the human to add
[SPEAKER_02]: more yes so I guess I'll answer that in a
couple parts first supplementation of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes um it's it's sort of a spicy take
but I don't love the addition of that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of stuff because as you say it is very
transient and most of the times that were
[SPEAKER_02]: like when we talk about building a living
soil and we're adding like like
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizae or um like bacterial I think
bacterial is the easiest to get started
[SPEAKER_02]: with and because they grow so quickly and
they have such a quick life cycle it might
[SPEAKER_02]: do better but most of that is relying on
the fact that it's going to stay put um in
[SPEAKER_02]: particular mycorrhizae because like the
mycorrhizal structure that actually
[SPEAKER_02]: provides benefit to the plant includes
like hyphae which are basically little
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal roots that that need time to grow
they're very fragile they're even they're
[SPEAKER_02]: even this thin maybe even thinner than a
root hair like they if you start moving
[SPEAKER_02]: them around um and this is something I
don't know if you've heard of no-till but
[SPEAKER_02]: it's one of the main reasons why people
try not to till their soil because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually disrupting all those little
fungal roots um and I don't see that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's really going to be something that
can form properly in something like hyphae
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponics where there's current and in
the same way that the root hairs don't
[SPEAKER_02]: farm I would not expect to see fungal
hyphae form at least not to the extent
[SPEAKER_02]: that where they're helpful um bacteria a
little different because again they can
[SPEAKER_02]: they can still colonize kind of on the
surface of the plant root but their main
[SPEAKER_02]: job in an in a soil system is to help
break down nutrients and some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: we were talking earlier like provide
protection and stuff and they're just
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be more limited um as far as like
how that fits into I think it's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: easier to get that started in peat but as
you say when we're watering it through and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not really providing for the
bacterial or mycorrhizal community as well
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not really getting set up there
before you're adding something different
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're just pouring more stuff in
there does that answer your question yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it does and um it would make me think then
that um without the the constant access to
[SPEAKER_00]: the resident microbes and nutrition as you
described it and instead um it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be there when I add it that um
you know you might you might still get
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly fine cannabis plants but there's
some percentage of of thriving or or in
[SPEAKER_00]: our case with the cannabis plant
specifically um yield and uh and terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile that you might experience a little
less in these mediums where we have to um
[SPEAKER_00]: add the new nutrition through a coco peat
or hydro system whereas in living soils
[SPEAKER_00]: it's there um would you agree with that
assessment that those those plants will be
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly fine and people have great
success with them but but there's there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some percentage that's more than
zero that would be benefited by the living
[SPEAKER_02]: soil approach i like i am i'm heavily
biased towards living soil i think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like such a such a fantastic like build an
ecosystem from the ground up and let your
[SPEAKER_02]: plant live in it um i think we've talked
about this before maybe on the last time i
[SPEAKER_02]: was here where i certainly believe that
there is a shift like each growing method
[SPEAKER_02]: that you use does something a little bit
different to your plants and it depends
[SPEAKER_02]: when we're talking about like um like
terpene profiles and stuff like that there
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely is a difference when you when
you grow in living soil versus when you
[SPEAKER_02]: grow in hydroponics when you stress them
out when you don't like we we know we can
[SPEAKER_02]: influence these terpene profiles depending
on what we do to the plant so i don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: if that necessarily makes it better or
worse but when we talk about things like
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria and adding adding mycorrhizae i
think you really have to ask yourself why
[SPEAKER_02]: you're adding it because when we're going
to hydroponics and aeroponics uh we're
[SPEAKER_02]: providing pretty much everything the plant
needs to put on weight as far as yield
[SPEAKER_02]: goes like we're providing it nitrogen and
minerals and phosphorus and you know all
[SPEAKER_02]: these little things to to help it out it
might not be as good at defending itself
[SPEAKER_02]: from disease um or something like that
that might be benefited by a living soil
[SPEAKER_02]: but like for just making flowers grow
it'll be perfectly fine um but that's why
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're adding it to a hydroponic
system i don't know that it always is
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the thing that people think it
should be doing if that makes sense yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it does make sense all right so to to wrap
up this uh second set um i'd like to get
[SPEAKER_00]: you to weigh in on um pot variety um
plastic pots versus fabric pots um you
[SPEAKER_00]: know a lot of people were happy to move on
from the plastic pots um because you know
[SPEAKER_00]: a they they get hot if you live somewhere
hot because they're black uh b you know
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't breathe if that is an advantage
uh c it can get kind of swampy in there if
[SPEAKER_00]: you tend to overwater or if you don't have
a good uh soil structure um versus the the
[SPEAKER_00]: air pot which uh excuse me the fabric pots
and air pots i guess where they they talk
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time about how uh the roots are
air pruned along the side and um you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there can be more oxygen exchange but i
don't really know that air pruning along
[SPEAKER_00]: the side of a fabric pot um or more air
exchange with the pot are necessarily good
[SPEAKER_00]: things i i don't i i know they claim them
to be good things but i don't know that to
[SPEAKER_00]: be true it does seem that the plastic pots
would be more akin to to actually being
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in soil but i don't know that so i
would like to hear you compare the two
[SPEAKER_02]: okay well um i guess for starters i do
tend to use air pots or or fabric pots um
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's it's sort of a combination so if
we think about the whole oxygen air thing
[SPEAKER_02]: we do actually need soil to be aerated
most of the beneficial microbes that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about today are um they're
requiring oxygen just like everything else
[SPEAKER_02]: is and in on the opposite hand we have a
lot of bacteria that are not healthy that
[SPEAKER_02]: grow in anaerobic or like oxygen free
areas so when it comes to extra oxygen i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm all for that it sort of prevents i
mean there's still other husbandry things
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would want to consider but in my
opinion it helps prevent things like
[SPEAKER_02]: pythium and stuff like that from really
taking root um and like air pruning and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that changes the root structure
i'm not 100 sure if it's for the better or
[SPEAKER_02]: if the worst but it does seem to do a
pretty good job of growing like mother
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and stuff like that i will say they
are paint water because um the water just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of leaks out the sides you still have
to have like a plastic saucer underneath
[SPEAKER_02]: and they don't there's definitely things
that i don't absolutely enjoy 100 about
[SPEAKER_02]: them when we look at like a hard wall
plastic pot um i think you do like they're
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely easier to water and they
definitely retain um they don't dry out as
[SPEAKER_02]: as quickly i guess um so you can put water
in there it's not evaporating out the
[SPEAKER_02]: sides so the whole root ball it might be
easier to control for water moisture if
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't water as often or something like
that um and again i think there's other
[SPEAKER_02]: husbandry issues that you that you'd also
have to look into as far as whether that
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily makes the growth of bad
bacteria easier or not that often has to
[SPEAKER_02]: do with the type of soil you have too so i
don't know if it's directly relatable um
[SPEAKER_02]: but i feel more comfortable in in the in
the fabric pots and one way to get around
[SPEAKER_02]: the miserable watering situation is to use
like drip emitters or something like that
[SPEAKER_02]: where your soil is more constantly um wet
which is actually especially for living
[SPEAKER_02]: soil better because a lot of the microbes
need to be wet constantly too so as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: living soil goes my personal preference
would be fabric pots right on thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great analysis um i use the fabric
pots as well and there was one thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: i learned about them that that really
annoyed me i still continue to use them
[SPEAKER_00]: but i i didn't like this fact figuring it
out um i was i was talking with uh uh uh
[SPEAKER_00]: josh from dragonfly earth medicine about
them and about how how i you know i i like
[SPEAKER_00]: using fabric pots versus plastic pots so
that there's you know i'm using less uh
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic and uh he had the audacity to
point out that even though we're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: term fabric pots that uh nearly all of
them on the market are spun plastic and i
[SPEAKER_00]: looked into it and damn it he's right and
so they're they're plastic pots just in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different form and so um that fact pissed
me off and so i went and i and i i
[SPEAKER_00]: intentionally purchased actual hemp pots
and they degraded and fell apart in one
[SPEAKER_00]: season and i'm like well damn the biology
of it um makes the spun plastic i guess at
[SPEAKER_00]: least necessary for the time being until
we got another material but um yeah me
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that air quotes fabric pots were
some kind of linen was like totally wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: no and i think a lot of um i think you're
probably not alone because i think a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of us are trying to use less plastic and
that kind of stuff and i don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: think that fabric pots will mean less
plastic because it's basically like
[SPEAKER_02]: wearing a polyester shirt or something
like that there's definitely some plastic
[SPEAKER_02]: in there but as you say many of the
natural fibers tend to disintegrate very
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly um so like felt or spun or
whatever you're you're gonna the the more
[SPEAKER_02]: natural and less plastic you go the more
often you have to replace them which isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really a big deal i guess when you want to
like transplant into a field or something
[SPEAKER_02]: you probably like if they degrade in a
couple of months of you know watering
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably okay but what i hate
though is the idea of my uh spun plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: fabric pots that are outside and once i
learned that as they degrade over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years they are very likely shedding
microplastics into my farm's ecosystem and
[SPEAKER_00]: that was very disappointing to me and so i
don't have a solution for it but i think
[SPEAKER_00]: that i think that it's important for us
all to be aware of of the truth of it
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely and i think that goes to like
like when we're choosing things to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: preference over like i think when you
choose a fabric pot because you aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily saving the plastic um and i
don't think in the heart well plastic like
[SPEAKER_02]: especially because you're putting acidic
fertilizer and things like that through
[SPEAKER_02]: you're breaking that plastic down too so i
it's it's a trade-off more about is it
[SPEAKER_02]: providing you the great right growing
environment for your method and then make
[SPEAKER_02]: your choice based on that because fabric
pots certainly in my opinion anyway
[SPEAKER_02]: support living soil better when you get
them going um but i mean a hard wall
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic is totally fine too right on cool
all right let's go ahead and take uh our
[SPEAKER_00]: second short break and be right back you
are listening to shaping fire and my guest
[SPEAKER_00]: today is plant biologist sarah lane online
cannabis seed distributors often seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: be all the same but multiverse beans
constantly works to provide you with

[SPEAKER_00]: shops simply buy breeder minimums but i
get messages all the time from breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: saying some version of multiverse asked to

[SPEAKER_00]: you can find rare cannabis seeds from
night owl seeds including the dark owl sub

[SPEAKER_00]: go to multiverse beans.com now for a
buying experience you won't get anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else one of the challenges with buying
auto flower seeds is that often you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have as many different phenos as you will
have seeds in a pack that can be fun sure
[SPEAKER_00]: but so many varieties in one pack is a
sign of an immature seed line that hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been worked enough i prefer my auto
flowers to be worked enough that each
[SPEAKER_00]: phenom in the pack really captures the
aspects that the breeder was intending
[SPEAKER_00]: this is why i recommend gnome automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cannabis seeds gnome automatic
seeds are not just crossed and released
[SPEAKER_00]: they are painstakingly sifted again and
again tested in a wide range of conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and taken to a level of maturity that each
plant will be recognizable by its traits
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that were hard earned so that you
can have your best growth cycle ever over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last 10 years gnome automatics founder
dan jimmy has become a trusted breeder and
[SPEAKER_00]: he continues to pour his passion of
breeding cannabis into every variety he
[SPEAKER_00]: releases for you to grow check out the

impressive plants folks are growing you
[SPEAKER_00]: can score gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_00]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website commercial cannabis farms
[SPEAKER_00]: across the country love growing gnome
automatics because of their consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed to seed short grow times thc
percentages and colorful bag appeal farms

want reliable seeds hand-built from effort
[SPEAKER_00]: expert selection and experience choose
gnome automatics one of the reasons why
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till cannabis growing is so valued by
farmers is because the mycelium networks
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil remain established from year
to year and we know these fungal networks
[SPEAKER_00]: are essential because they are the
nutrient superhighways that extend far and
[SPEAKER_00]: wide in the substrate to feed your plants
the trouble with growing in new living
[SPEAKER_00]: soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
it takes most of the plants life just to
[SPEAKER_00]: create these mycelium highways dynomycho
endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant reduces
[SPEAKER_00]: that time and gets your plant eating a
wider array of nutrients faster and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: three times the concentration of the other
popular brand in the US at 900 propagules
[SPEAKER_00]: per gram of two fungal species selected
specifically for cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: dynomycho is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the vulcani
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture research institute in israel
it has also been vigorously trialed by
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and food growers across the US
dynomycho is now available at grow shops
[SPEAKER_00]: and on amazon in the united states i love
using dynomycho to both speed up the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of the mycelium networks in the
soil but also as a bio stimulant to make
[SPEAKER_00]: clone cuttings more virile you can see

zing to tired soil choose dynomycho to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize your plants potential dynomycho
endomycorrhizal inoculant welcome back you
[SPEAKER_00]: are listening to shaping fire i am your
host shango los and my guest today is
[SPEAKER_00]: plant biologist sarah lane so here we are
in set three for the big finish what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to focus on this set is is the you
know the care and feeding of a good and
[SPEAKER_00]: thriving root system because you know it's
one thing for us to understand what root
[SPEAKER_00]: structure is and what the what the root
system is doing but we as cultivators we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make it as as healthy and happy as
we can so um so sarah let's talk about how
[SPEAKER_00]: much to water um what should our
considerations be across the various
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate systems we have discussed today
to make sure that we're we're watering in
[SPEAKER_00]: a zone that is enough for the root system
but not enough to drown it well that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: good question so i think the first and
foremost things is that roots do not like
[SPEAKER_02]: to dry out so you want to keep making sure
that the soil is wet and that the roots
[SPEAKER_02]: the root ball itself is is nice at least
damp obviously over watering is a problem
[SPEAKER_02]: because the roots then can't breathe
they're kind of like drowning if you will
[SPEAKER_02]: um and and that's a problem so but it
depends on the substrate of what this
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like for example in hydroponics
they're kind of always sitting in water
[SPEAKER_02]: and there it's more important to make sure
that the the liquid is aerated properly so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not stagnant in aeroponics this is
almost never a problem you just want to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that the spray is happening
often enough that the roots are not drying
[SPEAKER_02]: out while they're waiting because it's not
usually a constant thing and then in soils
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to usually um when i'm watering i
lift my pot up a little bit and as it
[SPEAKER_02]: starts to get lighter and lighter you know
that the water is evaporating and then
[SPEAKER_02]: before it has a chance to get too dry um
then you water again and with living soil
[SPEAKER_02]: um systems it's even more important that
it stays damp so if the surface of the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil starts to dry out too much it isn't
that healthy for that system so then i
[SPEAKER_02]: would i would check probably daily or
every couple of days to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: that top layer is staying at least damp to
the touch and another read that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: another good reason to use some kind of uh
a small plant cover crop of some sort to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the top of the pot um moist so it
doesn't go hydrophobic and push the water
[SPEAKER_00]: off and uh and and helps the water get
into the pot i would think also that cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops um would be helpful because the
roots of the cover crop um also interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with the roots of the cannabis plant and
um you know they communicate and share
[SPEAKER_02]: resources right absolutely and cover crops
are an excellent um especially if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: working in a soil system they can be super
beneficial not only to to keep the water
[SPEAKER_02]: in because it's not getting lost and
evaporating as much um but also as you say
[SPEAKER_02]: because those roots are are providing like
a little layer of of support and
[SPEAKER_02]: networking if you are careful about what
you choose you can also be contributing
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen for example we often plant like
micro clover um or red clover in our pots
[SPEAKER_02]: because it does kind of give back to the
the system as opposed to some cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: where it would also be using up nutrients
i'm forgetting the the vocabulary word for
[SPEAKER_00]: it but um there are certain plants that uh
you can uh uh plant as a companion plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually do does the other plant harm
um are you aware of any plants where the
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots of that plant actually are
combative against cannabis roots um off
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of my head i'm not 100 sure i i
know some like classic i think what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: referring to is allelopathy yes um and
there's like definitely some plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: are just like absolute no toxic but
they're like big trees like you never
[SPEAKER_02]: plant anything under black walnut it's
like a circle of death but you're
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously not planting that next to a
cannabis tree i think if you're worried
[SPEAKER_02]: about it sticking strictly to things like
like clover um and some of the like if you
[SPEAKER_02]: go to a farm supply store they often have
good cover crops there and those plants
[SPEAKER_02]: usually are compatible with a lot of other
plants i don't know anything off the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of my head that i would want to put in a
pot that would do that but yeah stick with
[SPEAKER_00]: the basics unless you're choosing to
research it first essentially basically
[SPEAKER_02]: and like there's lots of lots of great
opera like options we do marigold you can
[SPEAKER_02]: do um like basil you can do like some some
types of herbs are pretty good in there um
[SPEAKER_02]: basil is really good basil and marigold
both are good too because um they can be
[SPEAKER_02]: planted in with your cannabis plant but
they also act as like an insect trap
[SPEAKER_02]: because um like everything loves basil so
if you plant a basil plant you're probably
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the first signs of bugs will show
up there so they can be kind of useful
[SPEAKER_02]: that way and of course like the clover is
a really good one too i've gotten into the
[SPEAKER_00]: habit of of throwing um different types of
food producing plants in my pots um i i
[SPEAKER_00]: toured um a farm where they were growing
potatoes under their their plants outside
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're in in the kind of um the duff
berm that they were doing out there at
[SPEAKER_00]: green source gardens and i thought that
was such a great idea but like you know we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be in containers where we are so
so you know i got strawberries grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: one i got carrots grown in another like
culinary herbs in another and uh and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you get you get that wind from the
cover crop but also you know if you get
[SPEAKER_00]: hungry out when you're working in the
field you have snacks so a little snack
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great right on so um how impactful
is the ph of the water that we're watering
[SPEAKER_02]: with on the root system um i think that
depends on the soil i it's so the ph of
[SPEAKER_02]: water that's one of the things that
preferentially kicks off nutrients and so
[SPEAKER_02]: the more acidic the water i think the more
nutrients you might kick off what does
[SPEAKER_02]: kick off mean so i guess if we want to
talk about the soil is like essentially a
[SPEAKER_02]: kitchen cupboard all these structures that
you see with your naked eye on the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: have all these little charges on them that
that sort of collect all the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: salts that you're adding whether that's
because a bacteria has broken it down or
[SPEAKER_02]: not as i said earlier everything is
basically a salt at the end of the day um
[SPEAKER_02]: but it stays there until something would
prefer to be in its spot more and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: usually um acidity so it will it will take
its place on that soil structure and
[SPEAKER_02]: because it takes the place then that
nutrient is free and it can go back into
[SPEAKER_02]: the water does that make sense it does so
then that once that ion is or salt is free
[SPEAKER_02]: then the plant can use it and so the plant
actually does it itself it makes acids to
[SPEAKER_02]: go out into the soil and to kick off all
the nutrients off the soil so that it can
[SPEAKER_02]: take them up and if you are watering in a
sit like an acidic um like liquid even if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just like water itself or whether
you've added like citric acid or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that you're going to be doing the
same thing the plant is doing but you can
[SPEAKER_02]: do that in excess where it would be too
much um but the soil kind of buffers
[SPEAKER_02]: itself too so it's one of those things
where on a on a like a a big level i'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: sure it's that impactful but that's what's
happening on a small scale so um so as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as like what we can learn from this it
sounds like you know unless your water is
[SPEAKER_00]: uh making a significant swing um that uh
the buffering of the soil and if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: generally trying to stay near neutral
anyway um the watering that you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: is not really all that impactful on the
roots on the ph level because it's the the
[SPEAKER_00]: system is more or less going to
self-regulate so long as there isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: something like really wild happening yeah
pretty much and i will i will put the
[SPEAKER_02]: caveat in there that um hydroponics is a
little bit different and i've heard
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple opinions about whether to ph your
hydroponic feed or not i personally do um
[SPEAKER_02]: because it it's hard to especially over
time it's hard to tell what um the soil or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever medium you're watering into has
retained and so making sure that your your
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients are the the ph they should be at
before they go in sort of helps if your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil's out of whack um but that's some
people don't and they seem to find it
[SPEAKER_02]: works fine so again it might just be like
like we were talking about earlier all
[SPEAKER_02]: these things that we do because someone
else told us to do it um it might not
[SPEAKER_00]: matter in the end right on let's talk
about temperature so there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different variables that can impact the
temperature of the substrate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: container uh this isn't something that we
need to worry about in soil because
[SPEAKER_00]: geothermal takes care of any plants that
are actually in the ground but um you know
[SPEAKER_00]: uh dark colored pots are are going to
attract and hold more of the sun's heat um
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got uh green houses and and tents
outside that can get exceptionally hot on
[SPEAKER_00]: on really hot days even if we are i've got
fans in them and i run into this on my on
[SPEAKER_00]: my deck because uh the the hours right
before the sun goes down my deck will get
[SPEAKER_00]: up to you know 95 115 like way up there on
a hot day and and any plants that i have
[SPEAKER_00]: on my deck will just will just cook i i
just imagine the the root zone's just like
[SPEAKER_00]: turning to mush so um i'm sure that there
is a range though where um you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the root zone is optimum so
we kind of talk about what temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: range makes sense for the root zone and i
don't know i guess i guess the only way we
[SPEAKER_00]: would know on a hot day would be to
actually throw a probe in there yeah so i
[SPEAKER_02]: guess the first part i would mention is so
it's kind of insulating um and again this
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of goes back to your growing method
like if you're a bare root ball hanging in
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponics that's going to be way more
important um on on a deck or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that like i think the same range that
you'd expect the plant to grow in so like
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 or i i guess i'm in celsius um i think
like around like a mild spring summer day
[SPEAKER_02]: would be fine obviously if you're getting
up to really really hot summer days you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to start seeing some effects but the
soil does buffer it it both hangs on to
[SPEAKER_02]: heat but also protects it a little bit and
most of the time when we're looking at i
[SPEAKER_02]: guess the second part is when we're
looking at heat stress on a plant most of
[SPEAKER_02]: what's happening is water so the heat is
is causing them to photosynthesize more um
[SPEAKER_02]: they're losing more water because that's a
direct part of photosynthesis is to lose
[SPEAKER_02]: water um and because it's happening at a
faster rate in heat and and they're also
[SPEAKER_02]: getting cooked at the same time so their
leaves are kind of not happy um it can put
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of water stress on a plant so that's
why you might see wilting or burning or
[SPEAKER_02]: those kind of things and so if it's a hot
day i think the best way to keep the
[SPEAKER_02]: insulating properties of the soil would
just be to water more because the water is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to take up some time to to properly
heat up it's also going to be providing
[SPEAKER_02]: for the fact that the leaves are
transpiring more and it's going to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots a little cooler on hot days like
this it's kind of generally accepted that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's better to uh water more times less
water during a hot day because um you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to say oh it's a hot day i'm
going to water more and just go with more
[SPEAKER_00]: volume because now not only is the plant
trying to take up water but you've kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like in you know um flooded the substrate
and and it's there's like almost too much
[SPEAKER_00]: water and it has to it has to deal with
moving the water around at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: as trying to take on water would you agree
with that best practice that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of doing your same two waterings a
day but you know make them larger in
[SPEAKER_00]: volume instead you know do the do maybe
even less than you would on a normal day
[SPEAKER_00]: but break it up into maybe four waterings
i feel like there's a couple options there
[SPEAKER_02]: because usually when i'm dealing with
plants that are outside that are like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a heat dome or whatever um i water more in
early morning when it's not hot so that
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant can i guess if you want to call
it water balance like then it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: already water stressed when the heat hits
and then i probably would check more
[SPEAKER_02]: because i i don't know if if you like if
it's best practices and people tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: follow that rule i'm far be it for me to
go against that um but i do think that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's less about like the volume of water i
think i think especially in pots there's
[SPEAKER_02]: only so much water that you can put in
there per soil amount but it evaporates
[SPEAKER_02]: really fast so i would say that it's
better to water more frequently and then
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you don't have to add as much water
but like in a pot on a patio there's only
[SPEAKER_02]: so much water that can fit in there and
it's not gonna be enough to keep it like
[SPEAKER_00]: cool throughout the whole day and and the
amount of water is probably gonna also
[SPEAKER_00]: change about whether or not you're in a
hardwalled plastic or if you are in a
[SPEAKER_00]: fabric pot too because those fabric pots
they just get all hot and they they start
[SPEAKER_00]: to you know lose water out the sides
pretty fast so fast yeah and then like in
[SPEAKER_02]: a garden for example i think because of
just how much soil there is like if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're in in soil in the ground like a
good watering first thing in the morning
[SPEAKER_02]: before it actually gets really really hot
you might have to check on that part way
[SPEAKER_02]: through the day hardwall like i was
mentioning but yeah absolutely for fabric
[SPEAKER_02]: pots because they evaporate out the sides
as well they're just not going to retain
[SPEAKER_02]: as much as much water so yeah and in which
case like you're going to be watering
[SPEAKER_02]: again in two hours anyway you don't need
to flood the part right um um let's talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about um uh supplements you
know there are there are different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of fungal supplements that are sold that
people say to um you know mix into your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil so that when you transplant a pot the
the roots will interact with the um with
[SPEAKER_00]: the supplemented uh fungi and will support
root growth you know essentially the the
[SPEAKER_00]: the connection with the um between the
root hair and the supplement will wake up
[SPEAKER_00]: the supplement and and that that fungal
presence will will ease the transition um
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant um do you see that happening
and and does that kind of support make
[SPEAKER_02]: sense i think it does to a certain extent
but it depends like we were talking
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier about the system that you're
coming from and into so it does take some
[SPEAKER_02]: time if we're talking about like
mycorrhizal inoculum or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that it does take time for that process to
happen because like i was alluding to
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier it's a conversation between this
fungus that's trying to help out and needs
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant and the plant which has to
prepare itself to accept the fungus so it
[SPEAKER_02]: can be helpful to get that going early um
but it really only makes sense especially
[SPEAKER_02]: for fungus i would say if you're going to
then put it into a pot where it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be disturbed or into the garden
where it's not going to be disturbed and i
[SPEAKER_02]: also think it depends on the health of the
system you're planting into like in a pot
[SPEAKER_02]: we have good control over compost and
stuff like that but it's a real old garden
[SPEAKER_02]: remedy to put a little extra stuff in
there when you transplant into um maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: not as rich of a soil or something like
that to give it a kick start and i would
[SPEAKER_02]: say if you're doing that with inoculum too
and you're not confident that the health
[SPEAKER_02]: of the soil you're planting into is is
that great then i'm sure that would give
[SPEAKER_02]: it a little boost and with bacteria i
think bacteria are a little bit a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more broad because they again they
don't they don't have those like root type
[SPEAKER_02]: structures like the hyphae um they don't
have that hyphae like the fungus do so
[SPEAKER_02]: they're more likely to just kind of build
up a little film somewhere and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: probably easier to water in in different
systems or more systems it might apply to
[SPEAKER_02]: more systems but um i think there's
there's no harm in trying i just again
[SPEAKER_02]: some systems are just not that set up to
support it afterwards in the first set you
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned uh two or three different
simple teas that you like to use um for
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition for the root zone i was curious
whether or not you have any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: simple recipes uh for beneficial bacteria
to improve the root growth because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned beneficial bacteria a couple
different times as playing you know an
[SPEAKER_00]: important role of uh both helping the the
roots thrive but also breaking down
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition for the entirety of the root
zone um i don't know if there is such a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing i'm just kind of fishing here but
but do you have a beneficial bacteria prep
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be uh poured into the pot and and
will help out yeah i think um i think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a bunch of good recipes online but
what we often do and what we do actually
[SPEAKER_02]: in research about um uh beneficial
bacteria and how it helps the root is to
[SPEAKER_02]: take soil or compost that's already full
of all the microbes you need um and then
[SPEAKER_02]: put it into some very well aerated water
um and then you can add a sugar source of
[SPEAKER_02]: some kind depending i know people talk a
lot and this is also very i guess veers
[SPEAKER_02]: into sort of compost literature but you
can get like green compost and brown
[SPEAKER_02]: compost and those will have different
types of microbial communities in them um
[SPEAKER_02]: and so you can you can be pretty confident
that if you're taking a sample from a
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy soil and providing it food like a
sugar source that you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of beneficial organisms including
beneficial bacteria so that's usually what
[SPEAKER_02]: we do like a good couple of composts a
little bit of molasses like i was saying
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier um and then some something for it
to nibble on like leaves or like i was
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about earlier bracken fern and
stuff like that and depending on the ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get different stuff now
are you talking about a a brewed compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea in that in that uh point because the
delineation i'm trying to make is um uh
[SPEAKER_00]: you know adding molasses to um a a compost
brewer if you're going to let it run for
[SPEAKER_00]: you know 36 hours or something and so
you're going to incubate those microbes or
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case bacteria that we want um and
then and then uh root drench that into the
[SPEAKER_00]: pot that's one use of molasses but then i
also have been hearing folks talk about oh
[SPEAKER_00]: i want to feed my microbes and so they're
they're pouring you know molasses or a
[SPEAKER_00]: water molasses slurry into the pot
directly which that sounds super scary and
[SPEAKER_00]: unbalancing to me versus in the first
example we're going to add enough molasses
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to feed the the microbe and
bacteria communities and then we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to pour it in the pot which is going to
decrease the i don't know hotness if you
[SPEAKER_02]: will of the molasses yeah i guess i guess
like i i just assumed we were talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about culture um which is my bad i should
have i should have clarified um when i use
[SPEAKER_02]: compost tea my idea is usually based off
of um i know a lot of people do this too
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're taking a small amount of
something and trying to encourage growth
[SPEAKER_02]: of that something into a supplement um you
can just water in compost water and it
[SPEAKER_02]: will do just fine and it might take a
little longer but remembering that a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of these bacteria and fungus like they eat
the stuff that's already in your soil so
[SPEAKER_02]: like rather than add molasses you could
probably add leaf litter or compost or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that to help them um
because that's what they're eating at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of the day so when i'm talking about
molasses and aerated teas i'm definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about a brewing tea where you're
trying to grow microbes for watering in
[SPEAKER_00]: later great i just wanted to make that
delineation really sharp since we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about both aerated compost teas and then
compost extracts right which won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: aerated and um i don't want anybody to get
those confused and just like you know free
[SPEAKER_00]: base molasses into their pot you know
because because it happens unfortunately i
[SPEAKER_00]: i and then and then and then they get a
decent plant and then now they swear by it
[SPEAKER_00]: right it's like oh but that's that's
dangerous so oh yeah and like superstition
[SPEAKER_02]: you you know you have the things that make
you work and and like if if it worked for
[SPEAKER_02]: you you're much less likely to not do
exactly what you just did because it did
[SPEAKER_02]: already work for you and there isn't
really any harm in watering compost in
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's already got all these
nutrients if anything you're just freeing
[SPEAKER_02]: up the loose nutrients that were already
free in the compost and watering them
[SPEAKER_02]: through your soil column and then and then
you also have all those little microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: that come with so if you don't have an
aerated compost set up um for brewing
[SPEAKER_02]: compost teas you can certainly just take a
couple of handfuls of compost put it on
[SPEAKER_02]: top and water through and it'll do the
same thing it might just take a little
[SPEAKER_02]: longer because you haven't encouraged that
the growing growth of those microbes in
[SPEAKER_02]: the same way i don't know about the sugar
i i tend to agree with the like it might
[SPEAKER_00]: be it might get things a little toasty in
there yeah right on so before i go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: the last question um of our chat um i want
to just throw a wide net here um uh is
[SPEAKER_00]: there anything else that we haven't talked
about today that can be done uh to support
[SPEAKER_00]: um healthy root life and root growth um
this is i just want to mop up any other
[SPEAKER_00]: best practices that i may not have known
to ask you but you because um because you
[SPEAKER_00]: are rootly uh you you you might know so is
there is there anything else that you uh
[SPEAKER_02]: would suggest or recommend i think i think
i've kind of covered a lot of areas that i
[SPEAKER_02]: would talk about with root health but i
think one big one is like trying to avoid
[SPEAKER_02]: disturbing the root system and and really
going for some sort of balance because i
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like we often just kind of manhandle
them they're this mysterious thing under
[SPEAKER_02]: there that we don't really think about and
if you're going to go for a healthy plant
[SPEAKER_02]: you need both a healthy top half and
bottom half so being gentle with them
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to trying to think about the
different things that you can do to
[SPEAKER_02]: support them especially the watering part
um we don't want stressed out roots so
[SPEAKER_02]: making sure that you're keeping them wet
and able to do their job i think that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: big one um but i think i think all the
things we've talked about today are good
[SPEAKER_02]: ways to try and promote root health but at
the end of the day it's up to the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can usually tell if the top half
is healthy the bottom half is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good too right on it does seem like
you know we keep on coming back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that our cannabis plants like uh the
most is balance and consistency right if
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can go slow and steady you know do
the same thing every day and try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it a consistent environment um while that
is so hard you know based on our different
[SPEAKER_00]: bio regions it it is the name of the game
absolutely and especially i guess the
[SPEAKER_02]: other thing i would mention is we focus
very much especially on a plant like
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis where we have an end yield that
we're really interested in that it's you
[SPEAKER_02]: still have to respect the process of
growing it and making sure that the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is healthy because at the end of the
day that one little part of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: you're concerned about relies on all of
the rest of the plant to grow properly and
[SPEAKER_02]: in the way that we want so don't neglect
your roots yeah amen right on all right so
[SPEAKER_00]: for this this last question it's it's fun
it is still a root question but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from a totally different direction
so um all the way back like i don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: four four or five years ago or so on
shaping fire episode 26 um i interviewed
[SPEAKER_00]: your neighbor up there in uh bc natasha
riz uh are you are you familiar with
[SPEAKER_02]: natasha i am oh fantastic quite a few nice
dinners together excellent well we like
[SPEAKER_00]: her too and um and we had her on the show
to talk about root ball medicine because
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis roots are filled with um all
sorts of cannabis uh um biochemicals i
[SPEAKER_00]: i'll guess i'll say um that do things like
uh uh reduce inflammation and and and
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that we tend to use the tops
of the cannabis plant for and and there
[SPEAKER_00]: are these biochemicals like there's
there's triterpenes in there and the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that most people focus on is freedom in f
r i e d e l i n for anybody who that's new
[SPEAKER_00]: but then there's also a whole bunch of
other ones which i could totally butcher
[SPEAKER_00]: the names of but the the point i want to
get to is that um since that show i have
[SPEAKER_00]: had audience folks from across the country
reach out to me and say hey we've started
[SPEAKER_00]: making these tinctures and salves from the
cannabis root zone and we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: really good um effects from them but we
want to know how to grow roots that have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten more of these various sterols and
alkaloids and triterpenes and these these
[SPEAKER_00]: these useful delicious medicinal
biochemicals and they ask me what can i do
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plant so that so that my roots are
more rich with these these these target um
[SPEAKER_00]: you know biologicals and you know i don't
have an answer for that except to say you
[SPEAKER_00]: know a thriving plant will probably
produce more of those like it does more
[SPEAKER_00]: resin and more terpenes but like i don't
know like i just made i just made that up
[SPEAKER_00]: i just given my best educated guess right
um but um this is so similar to the kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of research that you're doing i'm
wondering if you have a more educated
[SPEAKER_02]: guess i actually love this question i
think that um like my my work uh at uvic
[SPEAKER_02]: is very focused on trying to use plants
like plant processes that the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: already performs um to try and find things
that are medicinal about it um and this
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of does exactly that so when we think
of the different types of molecules that
[SPEAKER_02]: we find medicinal in a plant they often
have some sort of what we call uh broadly
[SPEAKER_02]: bioactivity which just means that it has
some sort of job that it can do in a
[SPEAKER_02]: biological system and like a common
example of that might be like an
[SPEAKER_02]: antibiotic like if we take it we get rid
of an infection hooray and it's usually
[SPEAKER_02]: from something that is also trying to
fight off an infection so a lot of our
[SPEAKER_02]: antibiotics might be from derived from a
bacteria that was trying to fight off
[SPEAKER_02]: another bacteria we found what it worked
so we use it same with antifungals and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that so my work is mostly
trying to decide okay if this is something
[SPEAKER_02]: that plants already make these molecules
for what if we stress them out a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit in this way so for example if you
wanted an antibiotic then you maybe give
[SPEAKER_02]: it a little bit of an infection or
something like that because then it might
[SPEAKER_02]: make more of that antibiotic for you um i
don't know how this translates to root
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine necessarily because a lot of
these things we don't fully understand um
[SPEAKER_02]: what they do like we know that when we
take them they have a lot of medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects and especially with cannabinoids
they have so many different um things that
[SPEAKER_02]: they do for us that they've like they've
been all sorts of different things that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have found out about them um but a lot of
those aren't things that plants do right
[SPEAKER_02]: like they don't like for anti-seizure for
example like plants don't have seizures so
[SPEAKER_02]: we can't make them have a seizure to make
more of that but for some of these things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that molecule you were just talking
about if it has an anti-fungal activity or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that then then maybe a
plant that has a fungal um problem might
[SPEAKER_02]: be good and then the other thing would be
we don't want plants that are too stressed
[SPEAKER_02]: out though because it still needs to have
energy to fight off whatever you're you're
[SPEAKER_02]: giving it um so it might be something
where you can um just expose it to any
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria like maybe a compost tea and
maybe it has some friends and maybe some
[SPEAKER_02]: not so friendly bacteria in the compost
tea and maybe that will stimulate it to
[SPEAKER_02]: make a little something extra and i'm i'm
just going to put the caveat that i'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: telling you to go out and like try and
make your plant super sick or dump
[SPEAKER_02]: fusarium in them or something yeah please
don't do that um but there's ways that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can say with our own bodies like um being
exposed outside and and those kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: things or eating organic foods that have
things on them and those kind of things
[SPEAKER_02]: that we know that um that if we're too
sterile our systems aren't happy so maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: the suggestion would be to just um feed
them some compost teas and some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that we've been talking about today
um so that the roots are not only healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: but also are interacting with other
organisms and then maybe that will
[SPEAKER_02]: stimulate more of a response just a guess
yeah yeah i like that guess um and while
[SPEAKER_00]: you were saying that i thought maybe maybe
we could get that from from watering in
[SPEAKER_00]: some non local indigenous microorganisms
right i mean we talk about imos all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time and how much we love them and how how
helpful it is to use localized ones well
[SPEAKER_00]: well maybe if we were to use some imo from
a different environment since that will
[SPEAKER_00]: have a whole bunch of strangers to this
environment maybe you can get a similar uh
[SPEAKER_00]: defensive medicinal capability um without
having to go so far as to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: actually cause damage to the root zone
just just threaten it yeah and like this
[SPEAKER_02]: might even be like we we know that
microbial communities are pretty local and
[SPEAKER_02]: like even maybe local to your garden
versus like across the street down the
[SPEAKER_02]: hall so maybe it's just as simple as like
if you live next to a bunch of oak trees
[SPEAKER_02]: and your friend lives next to a bunch of
pine trees maybe just get some soil from
[SPEAKER_00]: there and water it in right on cool well
thanks thanks for going down that
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical line with me just because um
you know you're you're you're my root
[SPEAKER_00]: expert and i mean i know i'm gonna be
getting this question more and so at least
[SPEAKER_00]: i've got you know more to say even though
we don't know exactly what it is so thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: for that and thank you sarah for joining
us again you know i'm so glad that we got
[SPEAKER_00]: a chance to uh continue the conversation
that we started in episode 99 about roots
[SPEAKER_00]: because there really is so much there and
that really showed me how much i take the
[SPEAKER_00]: the the roots themselves for um for
granted i talk a lot about the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: and the root zone and the community and
all that but specifically the roots i just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of i just kind of take them for
granted and and the more questions i asked
[SPEAKER_00]: last time we talked the more i realized i
didn't know so thank you so much for um
[SPEAKER_00]: for for joining us and sharing your you
know good cheer and expertise and um and
[SPEAKER_00]: and helping us uh grok a little more about
what's going on um underneath the surface
[SPEAKER_02]: in our pots oh my pleasure thank you so
much for having me again right on dear
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners so if you are interested in uh
reaching out uh to sarah lane or just to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of follow her along she doesn't do a
lot of social media because she's focused
[SPEAKER_00]: most of her time on the research but uh
there are there's one place that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: follow along and that's at her twitter and
uh her twitter is exudet rootley so that
[SPEAKER_00]: is e x u d e t t e r o o t l y and and if
you have um a question uh that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: not been able to find the answer for uh
out there on the internet or or an answer
[SPEAKER_00]: that you actually believe um sarah does uh
invite you to write to her directly um but
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that you give her some time to
get back to you because remember she is in
[SPEAKER_00]: a doctorate program right now and and her
