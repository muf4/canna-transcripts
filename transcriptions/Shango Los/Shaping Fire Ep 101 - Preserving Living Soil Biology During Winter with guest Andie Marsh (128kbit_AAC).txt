[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of folks in the
regenerative cannabis community who will
[SPEAKER_01]: say that they have been into natural
farming their whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't that I was against natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that I had never really
considered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a Midwest city boy with a great dead
head weed dealer and I just didn't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: need to grow my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never really gave it much thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after I moved to San Francisco in
1994, all of that changed when I visited
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis Perrone's Cannabis Buyers Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came in contact with epic varieties of
kind bud that totally changed what I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought weed could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really couldn't afford them in the
amounts that I wanted to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top shelf weed is expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that if I wanted to smoke those
flavors that I was going to have to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: how to grow them myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started learning about basic NPK
growing focused on the mineral and
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical content of the soil and really
wasn't all that passionate about it and I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't really follow through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of growing the fancy flowers I
now knew I wanted, I decided to just get a
[SPEAKER_01]: better job in the virtual reality industry
that allowed me afford to buy that top
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything changed though when I learned
about Elaine Ingham and her model for
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation called the Soil Food Web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of being focused solely on the
nutrient composition of the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: Elaine focused more on the life of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing cannabis went from boring nutrient
math to suddenly having a relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: with microbes and other life forms in the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like having friends in the soil who
I was getting into a relationship with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unlike the Tamagotchi that I kept
alive at the time, when I kept the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes in the soil alive, they grew me
amazing thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my kind of relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: My new friends were nematodes,
worms, arthropods and fungi and we shared
[SPEAKER_01]: the same goals.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is soil biologist,
Andy Marsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andy is a soil health practitioner and
focuses her efforts on soil restoration
[SPEAKER_01]: through her business, Rizos LLC,
based in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: She studied bioenvironmental science at
Texas A&M, focusing largely on
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural microbiology and
bioremediation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andy has studied the soil food web with
Elaine Ingham and is a certified soil food
expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is also a soil food web lab
technician.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that Andy has completed all of
Elaine's foundational soil food web
[SPEAKER_01]: courses and has gone further to earn a
soil food web certification and
[SPEAKER_01]: microscopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon she will also have her soil food web
consultant certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andy has been practicing soil microbiology
for over 12 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the first set, we will talk about
seasonal impacts on soil and biological
[SPEAKER_01]: activity, focusing on the metabolism of
the soil, changing food sources,
[SPEAKER_01]: and differences between container soil and
ground soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second set is the big one today as we
look in detail at the sorts of nutrition
[SPEAKER_01]: available during winter and discuss
preparing soil with specific compost tea
[SPEAKER_01]: brews, biological inoculants like protozoa
infusions and fungal foods, as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: effective use of mulches and crop covers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, we finished the episode in set
three with a discussion of best practices
[SPEAKER_01]: to revive your soil in the spring in order
to shorten its transition from winter
[SPEAKER_01]: dormancy to actively growing your thriving
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's episode comes from the perspective
of living soil and the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we are most interested in microbial
life and the prey and predator
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship in the soil and how that
changes seasonally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly there are soil chemistry aspects
to be considered after having a yearly
[SPEAKER_01]: soil test done, but that's not the focus
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we set aside mineral and other
amendments and focus squarely on the
[SPEAKER_01]: preservation of biological activity in the
soil so that you can preserve your gains
[SPEAKER_01]: from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the season, temperatures
obviously decrease and at the lower temps,
[SPEAKER_01]: life slows down both above and below the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the soil food web is cycling life all
summer, so our cannabis plants can grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to understand which aspects slow
down into the fall and winter in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: which causes everything to kind of go to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'd like you to start off with
a description of an active soil food web,
[SPEAKER_01]: a summertime soil food web, and then
describe the mechanisms that change and
[SPEAKER_01]: slow as we go into winter so that as we
talk about how to interact with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know the mechanisms that we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you know, with the food web,
we're talking about these predator-prey
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships below ground for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who's eating who?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the summertime in a vegetative
growth cycle, flowering cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a very active partnership between the
plants and the microbes below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're constantly communicating,
they're feeding one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in theory, if you've done a great
job of inoculating your soils in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring and you've established these
relationships or really introduced these
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships between the plants and the
microbes, there's a lot of predators
[SPEAKER_00]: eating prey, which is cycling nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say predators, I'm referring to
things like nematodes that feed on
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, nematodes that feed on fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the protozoa, which are primarily
bacterial feeders, things like flagellates
[SPEAKER_00]: and amoeba ciliates as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, and we can come back to this,
ciliates are more of an indicator species
[SPEAKER_00]: that we use to provide as a sign of
anaerobic conditions in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't want to see too many
ciliates among the protozoa in that
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this brings me to the point of another
feature that's happening in a thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone is the element of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have a lot of these different
types of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just going to see fungi or just
going to see bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a little bit of
everything in your soil at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as things kind of get colder and
are going into a more dormant state,
[SPEAKER_00]: the main element that is changing there is
as the plant dies back, it's no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: providing the root exudates to kind of be
a source of fuel and energy for its
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial partners below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their dynamics change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbial partners below ground are
going to start feeding on other things and
[SPEAKER_00]: finding other food sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really important for us to
know as stewards is what are those food
[SPEAKER_00]: sources?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have enough food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in theory, we actually want them
to stay as active as possible throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some really important reasons
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of what that root zone could
look like in the winter, if we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: consider the microbes' needs through that
period where they don't have their plant
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesizing above ground,
things tend to go really dormant below
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means you have protozoa that are
insisting and they're no longer feeding on
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, bacteria are kind of the
hardiest group so that you're always going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have your cold-loving bacteria,
your heat-loving bacteria, and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: always have some kind of bacteria activity
happening in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really a matter of losing some of
those larger organisms like your fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: activity, your nematode activity,
and protozoa that we want to really try to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep those organism groups active rather
than allowing them to go into dormant
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting, because I thought
that you were going to say that things
[SPEAKER_01]: slow down because of the temperature
primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm getting the idea that while,
yes, temperature probably plays a role,
[SPEAKER_01]: that really it's about the abundance of
summertime food sources that are
[SPEAKER_01]: decreasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is actually what causes the,
I don't know, metabolism of the soil to
[SPEAKER_01]: slow down.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like in nature, if you think about a
really mature forest ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_00]: one way that the trees in that ecosystem
continue providing for the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: underground that they're going to rely on
more so in spring and summer is many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the deciduous trees are going to drop
their leaves and actually feed that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's no longer through root oxidates,
but it's through this leaf litter on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's doing two things, that's
insulating the soil from those harsh
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures that you've referred to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also providing some kind of
organic matter to feed into that system to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the metabolism going below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can actually be quite busy if the
ecosystem is providing some kind of food
[SPEAKER_00]: source and protection to the
microorganisms in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that if the food source is
changing during the winter from being our
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis roots and potential companion
plants to now not being cannabis roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps still the companion plantings,
but now leaf litter and potentially a top
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch or whatever we're going to put on
the pot to help it over winter,
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's actually going to change the
varieties of life forms that are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be active in the soil too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will, it will certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times that leaf litter or
mulch that you're topping off a container
[SPEAKER_00]: with, or the soil itself with,
those are carbon rich materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is going to provide more
benefit to your fungal types of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your fungi are breaking down carbon
rich materials more so than bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're all linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as one organism starts feeding on a
particular material, it inevitably creates
[SPEAKER_00]: a by-product that another organism can
feed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's dependent on everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: When, when, when the pots, I guess this
question is specifically container
[SPEAKER_01]: oriented, but when a container gets cold
during the winter, you know, it gets,
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets true, truly cold in a way that the
ground won't since the ground is enjoying
[SPEAKER_01]: some geothermal benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there some parts of the root zone,
some inhabitants that we just know we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to lose during the winter because
they'll cyst up because it just simply,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cold is enough to knock them,
knock them back into a dormant state
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of just the losing of their food
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of think of this on a good,
better, best scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So best case scenario, you're able to
provide the root zone enough fuel to,
[SPEAKER_00]: and protection to actually maintain some
level of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not always possible, but the second
best option would be to protect it enough
[SPEAKER_00]: that those organisms that you do quote
unquote lose are at least insisting and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not actually dying, which is,
you know, the worst case scenario is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the extreme temps or conditions that that
soil is exposed to is so severe that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're actually killing the organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're essentially starting from
square one come springtime when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to rejuvenate that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so often we treat our containers and
sometimes even our fields as, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're done with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just like people just walk away
from it and, and, you know, they get into
[SPEAKER_01]: trimming or or start focusing on the
holidays or, you know, just doing anything
[SPEAKER_01]: other than farming because they've had a
long summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm actually getting this idea now
that, you know, the, that, that you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure that you button up your soil
properly before you walk away from it and
[SPEAKER_01]: not to be too hasty about it because we,
we want to kind of turn it from like the
[SPEAKER_01]: high, you know, the high, very active
setting down to like a low simmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the winter because we don't want it to
go entirely to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want it to turn down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, it, it, it eats through the
nutrition that we're setting it up with
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, so that when we, when we re when
we re approach it in the spring,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not, we're not having to start it
from a cold start, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's already a low warmth going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you observed there about how hasty we
can be once our growing season is over is
[SPEAKER_00]: really an invitation to reflect a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would, I always encourage people to
consider what's your relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil, that soil that you discarded or
the soil that you're no longer tending to
[SPEAKER_00]: just because your cash crop isn't growing
in it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And asking the question, you know,
are, are we going to need that soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: support our goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Later?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did we rely on it this past season to
produce something meaningful for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just because the cash crop
isn't actively growing, doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: our stewardship responsibilities for that
crop are over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have responsibilities and there's
the biodiversity of the partners below
[SPEAKER_00]: ground are part of what makes our crop
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just, you know, building a
relationship and considering that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have your, your crop in season,
what are you doing to ensure that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: caring for that soil system so that you
are introducing your plant to a very
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitable new home come spring?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that emphasis on the
stewardship.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a couple of years back,
I visited Nicholas over at Green,
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Gardens in Wolf, Oregon,
and he was walking me through and I like
[SPEAKER_01]: it because they do a lot of food planting
underneath their cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll have cannabis growing up top
and, and put potatoes growing underneath
[SPEAKER_01]: and green source gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and I asked him, I said,
Oh, I bet you, I said, Oh, I bet you're
[SPEAKER_01]: really going to be happy to like walk away
from the garden and be done with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, you know, I've never really
done with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all like the, the soil is a family
member, you know, and, and just because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, we're going into winter,
I don't, I can't just turn my back on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to do what I can to make sure that
it's taken care of and fed and loved
[SPEAKER_01]: through the winter so that we're not
strangers in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and like the first part of that,
I may have paraphrased poorly from him,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the, so that, so that we're not
strangers with the soil in the spring is
[SPEAKER_01]: the part that really held on for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I thought, I thought that was
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds very similar to the,
this idea of stewardship that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that phrase too, to, to be
strangers in the spring feels so
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you almost start feeling guilty at
that point, you know, cause I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: there, even, even as someone who considers
themselves very enamored with soil more so
[SPEAKER_00]: than the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when that planting season's
over, you just are eager to get
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable and, and kind of step away
from that work for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's room for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we all deserve rest and we should
snatch rest when we can, when we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's, you know, finding a balance,
like what does it mean to you to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: connected to that soil throughout the
winter and finding ways to do it that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes sense to you and given that
season of, of the year and in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also to take it into a non-soil
example, I feel the same way when I rush
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the plastic off of my greenhouses
in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I don't put them away properly,
you know, if I don't, if I don't wash them
[SPEAKER_01]: down, let them dry, fold them up and like
lovingly put them back, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's a season where I pull them down
wet, I roll them into a ball and I shove
[SPEAKER_01]: them in the back of the barn, which,
you know, it's not something that I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I'm ever proud of, but it happens
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I come back in the spring,
I see that now, you know, now the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plastic is more moldy and it's,
and it's, and it's crunchy and it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all like, oh, you did me bad shango,
you know, and I, that same thing happens
[SPEAKER_01]: with our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if we, if we want to have a good start
in our spring, we need to end the fall
[SPEAKER_01]: properly as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's, let's talk about the,
some of the differences that, that there
[SPEAKER_01]: is in the, the changing from a container
versus the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you know, during, during set two,
we're going to go into more detail about
[SPEAKER_01]: the things we want to do for our soil,
whatever, whether it's in the ground or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's in a container.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the, the coming of winter,
I would think that the containers are at a
[SPEAKER_01]: much higher risk of getting true seasonal
damage than the soil is because we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller diversity, diversity of life forms
because it's just contained in the
[SPEAKER_01]: container and things aren't generally
coming in and out unless it's being like
[SPEAKER_01]: delivered by, you know, birds or frogs or
people, people and life forms that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going by, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus the, the, the actual ground soil,
which has got a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity and also is being somewhat
kept warm just from the nature of earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree that, that, that those of
us who are growing in containers really
[SPEAKER_01]: have to pay more attention because the
ground some more often than not will cover
[SPEAKER_01]: your mistakes, whereas a container won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the ground is much more forgiving in
that way, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, not to say that we can't
also find a way to mess that up by poor
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, but in general, more forgiving
in ground planting and in ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, stewardship of the, of the micro
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like anything in controlled
agriculture or when we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: emulate nature, it's, it's always
imperfect, but we just do our best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we have these containers,
I think definitely the two points that you
[SPEAKER_00]: brought up are the, are the most obvious
ones, you know, like you have more of that
[SPEAKER_00]: surface is exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the surface I'm talking about is
like the actual root zone is exposed where
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just not the case in ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the observation you made about
migration of organisms is kind of a less
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious one to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really is a limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, like even during
the growing season, you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: migration between one root zone and
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that can be helpful if you
have really strong plants with great
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are thriving and then maybe some
plants that have some kind of disease and
[SPEAKER_00]: could benefit from, you know, the
migration of those organisms from one side
[SPEAKER_00]: of your planting to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people would actually view that
in the opposite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a, is this glass half
full or half empty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people would be concerned like,
oh, well, when you share a root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: now you have the risk of pathogens tearing
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that is also true, but if
you're, if you're actually growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: biological perspective, your decisions and
your amendments are all about focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial organisms and kind of taking up
real estate on, on the root surfaces and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant surfaces as well, because they
migrate below ground and above ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're, you're taking up real estate
so that pathogen, pests and pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even have a chance to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really what we're doing with our
amendments, whether it's in pots or in
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do find that you have to be much
more diligent in any kind of container
[SPEAKER_00]: because each, each plant now is,
has its own root zone that you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to rather than one single root zone
that has shared resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shared communication between the
plants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the first things
that we have to give up when we start
[SPEAKER_01]: practicing natural farming versus some of
the more sterile kinds, like, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, certain types of hydroponics and
such is that we are, we don't have sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are pathogens in every one of our
pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it's not about like making sure
my containers don't have any pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about feeding the beneficials and
making sure the environment for the
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficials are positive so that they are
always out competing the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know the pathogens are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a hard truth that's like
really creeps a lot of people out when
[SPEAKER_01]: they, when they come to regenerative style
farming at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but, you know, technically the
pathogens are part of, of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the food web as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just want them to play a very small
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like there might even be an
analogy here somewhere, like with our
[SPEAKER_00]: human societies, like you're always going
to have a bad egg on a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, that team is much more
resilient when you have a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, good, healthy, communicative
partners that are helping move the ball
[SPEAKER_00]: forward, you know, and they might even
band together and say enough is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting rid of this parasite that is
in, you know, messing with our,
[SPEAKER_00]: our goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, if you can kind of, sometimes that
helps to just relate to the soil in some
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like thinking about their
communities, similar to ours in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, their, the systems in place are,
are moving towards beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only when there's an imbalance in
the ecosystem that there's a specific set
[SPEAKER_00]: of organisms that take advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me just take a moment to,
Shingo, if you don't mind kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining some of my perspective on
pathogens, because I think it might be of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, when I think of pathogens,
this is, you know, this is me trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: reframe pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not perfect at, you know,
not getting angry when I see, when I see
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is destroying the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think of pathogens as filling a role
in the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a pathogen is essentially doing and
why it's evolved is that that soil is sick
[SPEAKER_00]: in some way, and it's destroying the above
ground organic matter to feed that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in time, that process of
pests and pathogens destroying the above
[SPEAKER_00]: ground parts of the plants and returning
those nutrients to the soil would set the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage for a stronger, more resilient
environment that would actually support
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more beneficial microorganisms
and kind of do themselves the pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: out of their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see a pathogen, it's really
telling to say, oh, well, something's
[SPEAKER_00]: amiss here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant isn't actually getting
everything that it needs from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, that's one way that the
ecosystem is communicating with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of trying to stamp it out with
pesticides and whatever else we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: our hands on, that is more of like a
sterilizing effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just consider what can we do to add to the
system to give that plant what it needs in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to fight that pathogen or eliminate
it so that it's no longer needed in that
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really healthy way of
looking at it, that even though,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because our goal is to have
beautiful, high terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: high cannabinoid flowers, that's the end
goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if the pathogen is challenging us
from getting to our goal, it makes us want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be pissed off at the pathogen when
actually it is playing its role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like if I get sick and I get a high
temperature myself, and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I'm so tired from having this high
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my body is intentionally increasing
the temperature so that I can heal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's trying to heal me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if we embrace the
pathogens as being a partner, but a
[SPEAKER_01]: partner that we really don't want to have
to do their role very often, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a more holistic approach to
thinking about our soil instead of like
[SPEAKER_01]: good guys and bad guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that analogy that you
provided as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all right, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that's set to where we talk
about the what to do and why is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the fattest of the three sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't we go ahead and wrap up and
go to our commercial break, and then we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get right to set two, which is probably
what most people are here for anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to go ahead and take a
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is soil biologist Andy
[SPEAKER_01]: Marsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without these advertisers, Shaping Fire
wouldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options and who to choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_01]: ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend gas lamp seeds to my friends and
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners who are looking for a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably already know gas lamp seeds
as HEMBRA genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: HEMBRA recently changed their name to gas
lamp seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas lamp seeds is not just another seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas lamp is a female operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: With over 60 breeders and over a thousand
strains to choose from, you will certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: find something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas lamp seeds has something for everyone
with over 650 feminized strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 regular varieties, and over 200 auto
flowers to choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Names you know you can trust like compound
genetics, Humboldt seeds, seed company,
[SPEAKER_01]: night owl, in-house, fast buds,
gnome automatics, and ethos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money but have no
[SPEAKER_01]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invited gas lamp to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_01]: about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have A plus customer service with
lightning fast response times.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will get
your order out the same day you place it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most seed banks are simply not this
organized or interested in getting your
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds to you so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But gas lamp seeds cares.
[SPEAKER_01]: You even get free seeds with every order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helene and Caitlin get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been in the cannabis growing
scene for over a decade.

[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of good people launching
new businesses in cannabis, psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_01]: and other psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very strange time for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the same moment that psilocybin
mushrooms are illegal at the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: level, they are becoming increasingly
legal in states across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: These businesses leading the way into the
future of plant medicines require
[SPEAKER_01]: specialized legal representation by
attorneys who have depth not only in
[SPEAKER_01]: litigation, mergers, and acquisitions,
but also in psychedelic and other plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Light Law Group has been empowering
cannabis businesses since 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the market has diversified into
psilocybin and other plant medicines,
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Light has been right there,
evolving with their diverse clients to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide legal expertise with a high level
of legal acumen, creative strategy,
[SPEAKER_01]: and precision that comes with an intimate
and specific understanding of both
[SPEAKER_01]: business law and plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a business owner trying to
navigate the layered local and national
[SPEAKER_01]: drug laws on your own, you are at risk of
fumbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: These confusing and quickly changing laws
complicate everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Light Law Group is ready to help you
when hit with a lawsuit, or because you
[SPEAKER_01]: were shafted by a vendor or business
partner, or simply because you want to

guidance before cultivating a controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: substance as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Light Law Group is a collection of
folks who care profoundly about their
[SPEAKER_01]: work, and I know this is true because I
know the folks from Green Light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a huge difference between a big
legal firm who has decided to start
[SPEAKER_01]: representing a few drug companies versus
working with a collection of high
[SPEAKER_01]: integrity, passionate lawyers who are
personally interested in new plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines and firmly believe in their
power to heal.

[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_01]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plant industry, and today many
cannabis cultivators are moving from
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays and chemicals to beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copert has the beneficial insects,
mites and nematodes, microbials,
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky cards, and air distribution units
you need to partner with nature to defend
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is soil biologist, Andy Marsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we were talking about
getting us all on the same page as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: an understanding of the soil food web,
what is happening systemically in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: as temperatures cool, and kind of making
sure that we all understand that the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter does not make the system stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The winter makes the system slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so set two is going to all be about
what can we do for our soil in what ways
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we can turn our soil down to this
slow simmer so we don't become strangers
[SPEAKER_01]: with it in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think about this,
Andy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to figure out what our goals
are for containers and soil going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made this list that we want the soil
to be fed, warm, watered, drained,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then undamaged during the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound like a pretty good list to
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really like the last one,
undamaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have used the word undisturbed,
but I think we're getting at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically just not trying to disrupt
that all of those organisms that are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: their work during the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start by getting rid of something
that I see all the time on like not not
[SPEAKER_01]: huge farms, but just like scaled
regenerative farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not uncommon for me to go to a farm
tour, and to see that cultivators have
[SPEAKER_01]: stacked their large containers during the
off season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just looking at it, it looks like an
obviously bad practice because at the very
[SPEAKER_01]: least, we are compacting the soil by
stacking the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time you go up a level,
it's more and more weight that's
[SPEAKER_01]: compacting a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I bet that you have other more
specific reasons why we should not be
[SPEAKER_01]: stacking our especially fabric pots over
the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would we start with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I want to I want to remove that as
an option for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there's a lot of a lot of
evidence for not wanting to to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure well, let me just first start by
kind of empathizing with why you might
[SPEAKER_00]: find yourself doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suspect it's one kind of what we
were talking about earlier about you're
[SPEAKER_00]: done with the growing season, you're just
trying to pack things up and get things
[SPEAKER_00]: put put away and kind of out of sight and
in a space where they're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: completely drenched in snow or whatever
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can empathize with wanting to stack
your pots of soil, you know, in a corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might even think that you're doing
a good thing by removing them from the
[SPEAKER_00]: elements in some regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more you kind of consider what's
going on in those pots, the less of a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea this becomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're right, you are certainly
compacting the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's problematic for a lot of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason number one, though, a soil
structure is something that I get really
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's it's where like biology,
chemistry, and the physics of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: meat is like creating great soil
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that we are attempting
to create throughout the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we whether we realize it or not,
are contributing to or or taking away from
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then come wintertime, if we don't
realize what kind of gains we made in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the improving the soil structure,
and then we go and stack these soils like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, we're really setting, we're really
kind of regressing in terms of whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: progress we might have made in improving
that soil's structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, compaction is like a surefire way
to kind of you're you're not only
[SPEAKER_00]: physically putting pressure to the soil
surface and creating compaction from the
[SPEAKER_00]: top down, but you're also kind of sealing
off the top of that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's limited air exchange and and
limited moisture exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what happens in in ground
systems when we can compact them through
[SPEAKER_00]: any number of means.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called soil sealing when you do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether you're doing it by stacking
pots or, you know, mowing a space too too
[SPEAKER_00]: often, and creating compaction that way,
the at the end of the day, you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing that soil's ability to bring
oxygen in which all of these microbes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about all these beneficial
microbes really need oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that thrive in oxygen poor
environments are our pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we want to make sure that you we are
topsoil can get air exchange, it can get
[SPEAKER_01]: some, you know, rain and snow and interact
with with nature as it will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like what you said, where,
you know, if we've spent all summer
[SPEAKER_01]: treating our soil fantastically,
why on earth would we want to suddenly
[SPEAKER_01]: give those advances back by by stacking
them and then crushing the soil structure
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've and our worms have spent all
summer working on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes our job a lot harder come
springtime when we're dealing with soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you plan to reuse that soil,
which, you know, you might not you might
[SPEAKER_00]: find that you actually need to purchase
new soil or make new soil, which can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the more you can do taking
care of the soil you got, the less labor
[SPEAKER_00]: and inputs and expenses you'll have come
springtime in dealing with that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really grateful that the the cannabis
growing scene as a whole has embraced
[SPEAKER_01]: reusing soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't it wasn't too long ago that
people thought that they needed to rebuy
[SPEAKER_01]: soil for every cycle, both indoors and
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they wanted to keep it as
sterile as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but but now we're realizing that that
aged older soil has with has got so much
[SPEAKER_01]: more personality, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and it's that biodiversity,
which actually makes your cannabis taste
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like sipping on my coffee here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear that about about cannabis
culture is that you're able to see this
[SPEAKER_00]: shift towards reusing soil and
rejuvenating it rather than creating more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more sterile environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if our goals for our soil is to have it
fed, warm watered and drained,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's start with the fed part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many folks have got their favorite
amendments that they you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've harvested their cannabis plant and
then they will they will amend or
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculate or add something before they
walk away for the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's let's talk about a couple of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically, you know, as I was
saying in the introduction, we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: approaching today's episode dryly
chemically like, OK, I did my soil test
[SPEAKER_01]: and now I need to add this kind of NPK
kind of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about what kinds of
amendments we're going to be doing to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: the the life force of the living soil
intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by all means, you know,
do your do your soil tests and and react
[SPEAKER_01]: to those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also want to make sure that our
soil just stays alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so let's start with nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so taking what you said during the
first set that there are the food sources
[SPEAKER_01]: are changing from the from the
rhizosphere, getting exudates from my
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant roots and having that back
and forth relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now the cannabis plant is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to add some nutrition so
that everybody stays alive in the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the root zones are not feeding them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what types of nutrition as a soil
biologist do you find are are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: most beneficial for the folks that we want
to keep going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way to think about this is to take
it, take an approach where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: providing a variety of foods, because
again, the theme here of the day is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to cultivate,
nurture and maintain a biodiverse
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial community, then you the more
different types of foods you can provide
[SPEAKER_00]: to your soils often the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one way to do that is to take a
multiprong approach by feeding the soils
[SPEAKER_00]: through maybe a cover crop so that that
you know, something that would survive
[SPEAKER_00]: your conditions when you're not growing
your cannabis plant anymore, but you
[SPEAKER_00]: instead come and plant a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will feed the soil root exudates in
lieu of your cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then compost tea is another great
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just want to take a moment to
kind of explain the difference between an
[SPEAKER_00]: extract and a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: An extract is you're generally just trying
to knock the microbes off the surfaces of
[SPEAKER_00]: solid compost so that you end up with a
liquid that has just kind of free floating
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms and those are really great for
soil drenches also in containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, to kind of infiltrate those
organisms through the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And teas are a little bit different in
that you have that brewing step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do the same thing where you're
knocking off the microbes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces of the solid compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this time you have a brewing cycle
where you're adding microbial foods and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're effectively increasing the
population sizes of those organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're kind of providing them this
packed lunch, so to speak, whenever you
[SPEAKER_00]: distribute that liquid onto your soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like teas as a method to feed the
root zone in the wintertime because it has
[SPEAKER_00]: more microbial foods in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not so focused on inoculating
because it is a challenging time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in theory, if we've done a lot of
great inoculating throughout the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: our main goal is just providing a food
source and not so much on inoculating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, inoculating is always
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of want to differentiate that
you'd be more focused on introducing new
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms into that soil, but not so much
in the fall and winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, there's compost and mulch
are also ways to feed the soil nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are going to be a different set
of food as well than what you might have
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated through a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the cover crop is kind of
the unique food source that we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily replicate because it's coming
directly from a photosynthesizing plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gosh, there is so much in that answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to tear this apart with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go step by step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing that you were talking
about was the variety of nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to ask my next question about
compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now I'm talking about natural
amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you talking about adding,
for example, like crab shell and feather
[SPEAKER_01]: meal and alfalfa meal and things like
that, making a blend of that when we are
[SPEAKER_01]: making soil and then putting that onto the
soil as a top dress or that maybe we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: then cover with a mulch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about specifically adding
those types of nutrition?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, what varieties of that
nutrition do you think work well in
[SPEAKER_01]: winter?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that you mentioned feel more like
they lean towards mineral amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: which do have eventually end up
interacting with biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most everything does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where I would, again,
kind of take this approach to your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health, not strictly from this dogmatic
biology is the only thing that matters
[SPEAKER_00]: mode, but more from an interdisciplinary
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really doing those soil chemistry
reports, saturated paste tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe even considering some of the
leaf tissue analysis that you might have
[SPEAKER_00]: done during the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the things that are going to
inform your mineral amendments that you
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think this is a good time to be
making those mineral amendments going into
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this is an experiment too,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find that maybe you amended the
soil going into your dormant period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would recommend testing it
again once it comes planting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just see, did it move the needle?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some areas maybe it did,
in some areas it didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And record that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really be diligent about what's
functioning and what's not, and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: curious about why that might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that kind of answers part of
your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think that I just learned
something because the very nature of my
[SPEAKER_01]: question, I think, is wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I asked that question with the
assumption or belief that, I like this
[SPEAKER_01]: term mineral amendments, that these types
of mineral amendments that are the same
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that we use when we're responding to
a soil test and we need to round out our
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was under the impression that the
microbe life also ate these mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in my head, I was going to feed my
microbe life both by adding compost tea,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we'll talk more about in a minute,
but also with these other mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess it's probably true that
microbe life may not even eat minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be really wrong on this,
but I'm always learning an embarrassing
[SPEAKER_01]: myself publicly on the show anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does the life, the living parts of the
rhizosphere, do they eat that stuff or
[SPEAKER_01]: not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be clear, I'm always learning too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my expectation is that those mineral
amendments are really useful during the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season when we recognize that
there's a mineral deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plant is in relationship with
the microbes, there's communication
[SPEAKER_00]: happening and incentives being offered to
those microbes to provide the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals that that plant is deficient in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is providing that from the
minerals that we're adding, but maybe that
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamic isn't so relevant come winter time
because you don't have that same crop as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of that ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a breakthrough moment for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mineral amendments are not really
for feeding the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mineral amendments are what the plant
wants and the microbes will bring them to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant in exchange for exudates and
other types of food from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during the winter, when the plant
isn't there, we don't really need the
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral amendments because there's no
bartering going on between the microbe
[SPEAKER_01]: life and the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're just trying to replace what
the microbe life normally gets from the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say I would say more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not necessarily trying to replicate
exudates in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to provide foods that we know
microorganisms feed on when there are no
[SPEAKER_00]: living plant roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in general organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like your humic acids, fulvic acids,
when you're brewing a tea, maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: consider fish hydrolysate and you want to
do these things mindfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to get into any specific
ratios or anything here, but just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stay high level in terms of how to think
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're brewing a tea,
you want to consider what is living in
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do this through a microscopy
assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most sure fire way to know
what's living in there and what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also kind of do this through
maybe maybe other indirect observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for instance, if your mulch isn't
really breaking down, like you've had
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch on your pots all through the
summertime and it still looks pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of that season and it's not
being broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Odds are you could benefit from more
fungal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe when you go to brew that compost
tea, you're adding more fungal foods
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than bacterial foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bacteria foods are simple sugars,
things like molasses and honey,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the fungal foods are going to be
more complex sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's let's talk more about
the compost tea as the nutrition for the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And less of it as using mineral
amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we want if we're if we're going to
be putting the compost tea into the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: at the beginning, like let's call it late
fall, is the idea that we want to we're
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially trying to add microbe life to
the soil via the compost tea that that
[SPEAKER_01]: then the larger microbe life that's in the
container will then be eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially we're we're pouring compost
tea filled with smaller life that the
[SPEAKER_01]: predators that would be normally getting
its food from the plant will then be
[SPEAKER_01]: eating all the life forms that are in the
compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what we're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to sustain this predator prey
relationship throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good way to look at it is
like you're providing providing prey
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms to nematodes and protozoa,
the predators in the soil, and you're also
[SPEAKER_00]: providing that packed lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the foods that you're adding to
your compost tea are going to end up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil once you apply it and not just
feeding the organisms that were in the tea
[SPEAKER_00]: brewer, but now they're available to the
organisms that are existing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this time of year, I know we're
both fans of brewed tea and also extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this time of year we actually want to
do a brewed tea because we want to we want
[SPEAKER_01]: to increase the density of the microbe
life because we want to offer lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: options of varieties of microbe life
that's going to be in the compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also want it to be very dense
because we want it to last throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I think I think teas are the way to
go in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, it's not that you're doing
anything wrong if you do an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the extract just doesn't have the added
benefit of the increase in microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: activity, nor does it have the microbial
foods, both of which can be of benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: going into this more dormant period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, if we if we've got a
microscope or or if we have the access to
[SPEAKER_01]: someone like you, who does microscopy for
other folks, you know, for a living,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is one great way to know how we want
to build our fall brewed compost because
[SPEAKER_01]: you can like literally look and see who's
in the soil and see who's there that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to feed and then and then who you
might want to add to the soil to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: round out the the predator prey
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, most folks who don't have a
cannabis growing business or just home
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, they're probably not going to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so can you can you give some advice or
some mental structure to what the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: us should do to what would you recommend
to have in our brewed tea for fall when we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't exactly know what's in our soil,
but we want to give it kind of a general
[SPEAKER_01]: buffet so that so that we can do the best
we can without exact knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the biggest thing to be
aware of is that what we don't want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is be brewing a bunch of bacteria and
putting that on our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that because a really common
characteristic of a disturbed soil
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem is that it's very bacteria
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to cannabis,
we want a little more balance between our
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and fungi ratio instead of it
being entirely bacteria dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, fungi is more sensitive to
mechanical disturbance, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any time we dump our containers or turn
them in any kind of way or they're exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: for long periods of time, we'll expect to
lose some kind of fungal biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not but we'll actually see an increase
in bacterial biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that the
bacteria start feeding on the fungi that
[SPEAKER_00]: are dying off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kind of have a little party all
to themselves to increase their numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that that's one balance that we
want to be really careful about when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: making our own amendments and we don't
have the tools to really look at a drop of
[SPEAKER_00]: that tea under the microscope and see
whether or not we've just got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and no predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if we're brewing something that's a
little more balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that I'd encourage people to
do is create what I would call a protozoan
[SPEAKER_00]: infusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a method that I've learned from
the soil food web by Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you take healthy leaves and different
kind of vegetation and put them down in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket with kind of something to weight
them on top, like a rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can add just the tiniest bit,
like a drop of honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually going to encourage
some bacterial growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what occurs in tandem with that is the
predators will respond to that increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacteria population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I was doing this without a
microscope, I would go online and do some
[SPEAKER_00]: research and see if you can find the best
time to use that kind of brew because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be a peak period after
you've encouraged the bacterial growth
[SPEAKER_00]: that the protozoa will have had a chance
to respond to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can use that as a useful way
to introduce predators into your
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of others are to just focus more
heavily on your fungal foods and go really
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little to no bacterial foods as you're
preparing your compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you can find some guidance
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, humic and fulvic acids are
really useful for feeding fungi as our
[SPEAKER_00]: fish hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some others online that I've
yet to try, but I'm sure are just as
[SPEAKER_00]: viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like this protozoa incubation
technique that you just described.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not come across that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like the idea that I don't have to
just make food available and hope for the
[SPEAKER_01]: best, but that I can actually incubate
protozoa and make more of them and then
[SPEAKER_01]: pour them into the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sounds like something that I would
want to do any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd want to do it in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd want to do it before flower,
when the plants are working the hardest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, at fall to keep every...
It seems like it's a good thing for all
[SPEAKER_01]: through the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think any time that you really need
a nutrient boost, that's when I'd focus
[SPEAKER_00]: the most on your predators because that's
who's doing that job for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: By feeding on the bacteria, they're
cycling nutrients to your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the times and the growth cycle
that you pointed out are dead on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another thing that you mentioned when
we started talking about best amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: for pre-winter, you were talking about
inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you consider this an inoculant or
how were you using that word?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of as an inoculant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in my head, this may be
inoculating my soil with protozoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I may not be using that word in the
proper scientific way.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the case of the protozoa
infusion, that's certainly an inoculation
[SPEAKER_00]: technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to introduce a specific
organism or group of organisms into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I would define inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I mentioned earlier that I
wouldn't be so focused on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, it's not that inoculation isn't
happening with your compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more that your focus and intention
and again, relationship with what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing is thinking more critically about
the foods you're putting into that tea
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than what you're necessarily
growing in population in that tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the springtime, I'd be much more
focused on looking at the samples from my
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea and making sure I know how
much fungi is in there and how much
[SPEAKER_00]: protozoa and et cetera are in there
because that would matter more to me come
[SPEAKER_00]: springtime due to all the nutrient cycling
that I'm going to rely on for my plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the winter time, I'm more concerned
about feeding the microorganisms below
[SPEAKER_00]: ground and less concerned about what
they're going to do for my plant because
[SPEAKER_00]: my plant's no longer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've talked about the mineral type
amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about adding complex brood
compost teas so that there's an array of
[SPEAKER_01]: buffet of foods for our life forms in the
soil since they're not going to be getting
[SPEAKER_01]: it from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this delightful protozoa
infusion, which I want to make one
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the last category that I want to
talk about are what kind of a role at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point would you think that natural farming
fermentations, like everybody's talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about Korean natural farming and fermented
plant juices, things like this that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: making, which are in a way kind of like
incubated nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some of them, even incubated
hormones, if we're going to be using a
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh grown tips that we harvested in the
spring or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of me thinks, oh, I should add some
of that stuff in the fall to keep some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that zesty life force in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of it is also me thinking that's
adding the wrong kind of encouragement at
[SPEAKER_01]: the wrong time of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more of a spring thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might not want to be using those
types of ferments as a going into fall
[SPEAKER_01]: root drench or something like that at this
time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there any role for that kind of a
incubated fermentations I think you're on
[SPEAKER_00]: the right track with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't think that there's anything
that would go wrong necessarily by adding
[SPEAKER_00]: those fermented plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it fermented plant juice that they call
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to be clear, I'm not fully up to
speed on KNF methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fascinated by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of things in
common in terms of what we're interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in doing from a biological perspective,
whether you come from the KNF side,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil food web side, or there's any
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're really focused on
mycorrhizae, we're all kind of generally
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in similar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think with what I know about the
fermented plant juice approach being more
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on those plant boosting,
signals that would make the most sense to
[SPEAKER_00]: me in the context of the growth cycle when
you need that kind of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's not that you'd be doing
much harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like, are you spending your time
and energy producing a thing that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually help the soil at this current
state that it's in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that that'd be the best
use of your time is focusing on those
[SPEAKER_00]: types of amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also discourages me because I
have been hanging out with other folks and
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been talking about it and it's not
uncommon for me to hear people say,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I had some extra FPJ in the fall and
so I just put it on the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might actually, it might be
better to waste it or hold it for the
[SPEAKER_01]: spring instead of throwing it on the pots
and kind of confusing the system at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it could, I don't know,
I imagine that it could confuse the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the microorganisms are receiving these
chemical signals that were derived from a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that was actively growing,
but they're not actually supporting an
[SPEAKER_00]: actively growing plant, then it might kind
of be unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to know what's really going
on without digging into some academic
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's even been done on this kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if you can preserve that
amendment and save it for spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be a much better use of that
amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is totally conjecture, but it could
totally be the case that the microbe life
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes aware of those chemical signals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they think that, oh, there must
be a plant around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then they start looking for
exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, when we don't want them looking
for exudates, we want them focusing on
[SPEAKER_01]: eating other, other, you know,
predator prey relationship life forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's like when you go past
somewhere and you smell somebody's
[SPEAKER_01]: barbecue, but it's like, you're not,
it's not your barbecue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not getting barbecue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're like just hungry and
annoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to go out of your way to go
find barbecue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so let's, let's move on to top dress
mulches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are different mulches.
[SPEAKER_01]: With different goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to my best understanding, the two big
reasons we use them are number one,
[SPEAKER_01]: to create some kind of warmth at the top
of the container or on our field over the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then also that as it breaks
down, it is biologically active and kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like a slow drip of interesting
nutrition into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with both of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: And would you add anything to that list?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I think I would use the word
insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I, you know, it's, it's really
creating a barrier between the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, like the ambient temperatures
and the soil atmosphere, soil sphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, it's creating biological
biologically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I feel like we might get into it,
but to answer your question directly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't add anything to that list at
this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about cover crops,
you know, when we, when we segue to the
[SPEAKER_01]: next topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this time I'm talking more about,
I guess I'll say not actively living
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what are some of your favorite over
winter mulches?
[SPEAKER_00]: One word, and that's aged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want aged mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can find mulch that is from my
region as locally as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's ideal because in theory,
they, those feed stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll, they'll have the, the organisms
that can survive your, your local
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just colonized on their surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say aged because, uh, the younger
the mulch, the more resistant it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: is to microbial activity, which is not
what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like in the landscaping industry,
it's really common to use very young
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch, um, to use cedar mulches or other
mulches that have a lot of secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites that deter breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for aesthetic reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course here in uh, cannabis,
we want to actually be feeding the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: with our mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more aged, uh, generally the
better, I'd say that at minimum you'd want
[SPEAKER_00]: that mulch to have been kind of sitting
somewhere as wood chips for a minimum a
[SPEAKER_00]: year, um, ideally longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like that, you know, you,
you kind of just systemically over the top
[SPEAKER_01]: said, whatever your mulch is, we want it
to be old, which I like because we all
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to different things depending
on our bio region.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so you want to use wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want them to be old though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to use forest stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to be aged forest stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to use old grass clippings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want them to be old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is what, whatever that you've
got, um, is usable, just make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's matured enough so that it breaks down
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in the case of things,
that might break down faster than wood
[SPEAKER_00]: derived or, or lignin, um, based
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you mentioned, the grass clippings
like that, you wouldn't want those to be
[SPEAKER_00]: aged a year at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think you could, you could,
um, with something like grasses or any
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like vegetative biomass that you,
uh, chop down and kind of, I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: people do this with like flail mowers,
the chop and drop method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to just set it and leave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's better than removing a lot of
that material if it's already,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's already in place, like if it's in
situ and you are chopping and dropping,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's totally appropriate rather
than the disturbance that would be caused
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were to remove that material and
try to age it somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you, you might decide to actually
compost that material and that's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as a mulch purpose goes,
I think a chop and drop method is just as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I have heard people talk about them
using mulch to keep their containers,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, warm over the, over the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's funny, uh, you mentioned earlier
that it's, it's, it's used like kind of as
[SPEAKER_01]: an insulator and I'm like, oh,
that makes sense too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always thought that the reason we
are using it to air quotes, keep our pots
[SPEAKER_01]: warm is because the mulch as it rots,
it's, um, it's warm, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like a warm compost pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually thought that it was that as
it broke down, it was creating a warmth,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a heat source at the top of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm understanding that it's really
more about like being a, like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bandaid, if you will, on the,
on the wound where you removed the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're kind of like sealing it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what, at what point is it too much of
a good thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the, in the first set you were
talking about, um, we, we don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: over seal our, uh, the tops of our pots,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we, we want it to be able to engage
with the, the atmosphere and the rain and
[SPEAKER_01]: the air to some degree, but, but we also
want there to be like a nice thick layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So will you, will you speak to,
I guess, uh, the thickness of the layer
[SPEAKER_01]: and what kind of attributes we want our
mulch to have so that things like water
[SPEAKER_01]: and air can go through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of talk to us about what,
what the attributes of a good mulch are so
[SPEAKER_01]: that when we look at what we have
available to us, where we live,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can judge our mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that comes to mind is
the size of that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's too large, it doesn't provide
as much protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have large gaps, for instance,
um, I'm thinking of like maybe something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like really thick straw,
but you it's, it's not very finely chopped
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'd have, um, you'd have to put a
little bit more of that material layered
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to really effectively mulch a
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then there's also, um,
the, the fact that you want this breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the thicker that material is,
um, if it's really chunky wood chips,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, even if they've been aged,
um, that might not be optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want them to be, I'm just kind
of eyeballing things around the room right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but maybe, uh, two inches long by
half an inch wide would be like the North
[SPEAKER_00]: star and, you know, give or take an inch
on either side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, the point is you don't want,
um, bark essentially, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: four, four inches long by three inches
wide would probably be getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, too, too large for the kind of mulch
that we're interested in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also avoiding hydrophobic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this still applies even when you're
mulching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of ironic because you mulch
the soil surface to try to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation loss as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's one that we can add to the
reasons for mulching is to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporation loss from the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, among the other two, which was
insulation and keeping things biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: active, but, uh, the, the mulch layer
itself can actually go hydrophobic if you
[SPEAKER_00]: really neglect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, making sure that it, it is getting
some amount of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there aren't any rains or any
precipitation that they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: getting, uh, watered in some way because
they really mulch layers really can,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, compact similar to soil, um,
and provide a hydrophobic surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, which can become problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other features and mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, those are the two that are
coming to mind, Shingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll kind of turn it over to you and
see if you have any questions about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm getting this picture hearing you
describe how, um, we, we don't want it too
[SPEAKER_01]: chunky, but we don't want it too fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of reminds me of, of that,
uh, that old example where, where the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the college professor holds up a jar with
marbles and it says, is this, is this
[SPEAKER_01]: full?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody goes, yeah, it's full.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then and then he adds,
uh, something smaller than marbles and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, and it fits in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, is it full now?
[SPEAKER_01]: They all like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he adds water and you're like,
oh, so, so I'm kind of thinking that a
[SPEAKER_01]: blended mulch is, is probably going to be
our best practice where perhaps you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, some semi chunky things that are age
wood chips and then some, and then some
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller things that maybe is forest duff
and leaf litter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe um, you know, something
else like, uh, like a powdered biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that when you put that,
when you put it all together, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a ratio that, that looks good to you,
you have, you, you have some of each,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can kind of blend those in a way where
there is enough room for airflow and for
[SPEAKER_01]: water to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a sealed thing, but,
um, but it's by blending two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch things together that you actually
come up with the optimum mulch for where
[SPEAKER_01]: you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that because it harkens back to
variability, you know, supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's definitely, again,
I think of these things as either good,
[SPEAKER_00]: better, best, or having a North star and
just aiming for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't beat yourself up if you can't get
your hands on, you know, four different
[SPEAKER_00]: feedstocks for your magical mulch
concoction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, but the, the more variability,
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, and that, that does apply to
the, the size and the source of the mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we go on to cover crop,
let's, let's talk about what I did this
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, get a little, get a little free
consulting out of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I did something, I thought about it
a little, but I didn't think of it a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: and I probably should have waited until
after, um, we recorded this episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I had access to a whole lot of,
um, a CBD hemp biomass this year where,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they just take the whole plant and
they, um, they essentially wood shipped
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole thing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why they did this exactly,
but, um, they had it and they offered it
[SPEAKER_01]: to me for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I'll take it and I'll figure out
some kind of fertilizer for it or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I noticed that, um, you know,
I didn't have anything set aside to mulch
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of my pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going into fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I put about an inch layer of this,
uh, pretty finely powdered, essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: chewed up cannabis hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just put like an inch layer on there
because in my thoughts were, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would, it would insulate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would let the water through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if there's any snow that we get this
year, it'll protect the soil from that
[SPEAKER_01]: cold shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as it rotted, oh, and this was,
this was aged.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this, this material was probably
about three years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and so at, as it breaks down,
since I already know it's a hemp plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably going to be packed with the
nutrition that my plants want next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, except for the fact that it wasn't,
you know, from my Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the, the, the IMOs won't be
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that it was going to be pretty
good, but now I'm starting to think that,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was, uh, I put a, an inch of
fine granular powder on top that it might
[SPEAKER_01]: actually get wet and kind of like push
together and actually create an oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: seal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might actually want to like remove
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like writing down notes as you were
talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that comes to mind,
and I just want to mention it in case it
[SPEAKER_00]: applies to anyone listening is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This material, um, it sounds, but until
you said that it had been aged,
[SPEAKER_00]: my original concern was that it would
still have a lot of nitrogen in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that that's just of concern
because it would start actively
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposing or composting really,
um, on top of this soil and generating
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you were talking about earlier,
your perception of mulch actually creating
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time that that, that I would
expect to see that happening is if the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the material that you're mulching with has
a high nitrogen content and it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and effectively what's happening is it's
being broken down by a lot of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're having a bacterial bloom and
that's what's generating the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going back to what we talked about
earlier, that's not necessarily in the
[SPEAKER_00]: best interest of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, um, in a really worst case
scenario, if you had, if you, you use a
[SPEAKER_00]: high nitrogen mulch product too thick,
you could actually create a little
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic environment and have,
um, again, very worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have like a combustion issue
crop up because, um, what happens in an
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic environment is a lot of those,
those microbes are generating alcohols and
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that will once oxygen does get
back into that system can become flammable
[SPEAKER_00]: at certain temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so again, just like kind of,
using a North star and a South star,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, um, that, that would be like
just a word of caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't, I wouldn't use high nitrogen
materials as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with the exception of that chop and
drop method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I say chop and drop,
I'm thinking of it in terms of,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, green vegetative biomass that you're
dropping on top of a mulched and already
[SPEAKER_00]: wood chipped type of mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a layered effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a carbon, um, it's not
indirect contact with the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I just want to clarify
that that would probably be, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the best case of a mulch situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had that, like a high nitrogen
vegetative plant decomposing directly on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that harkens back to the,
the one guide rule you said, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: aged, you know, so five follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so yeah, there's some instances
where, maybe, um, maybe you can get away
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not being aged, but just be mindful that
it's not actively, uh, composting on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this case, you've dealt with all
in theory, you know, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened during those three years,
but you've dealt with a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine any kind of resins or things
that would create a hydrophobic,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, seal from a, a chemical
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the concern is the fine,
this of this mulch and just like in clay
[SPEAKER_00]: and clay soils that, um, become compacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all those platelets that line up
really snugly together and create this
[SPEAKER_00]: seal, um, in the soil and create
compaction layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that might be happening with a
really finely chopped source of mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, I think if you've put,
you said you put it on about one inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you could maybe, gently mix in a
chunkier mulch source instead of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and, you know, you're,
you're there with all the context in
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you know how bad it is or isn't,
but if it's, um, able to kind of be moved
[SPEAKER_00]: around and judged a bit, if you will,
then I would just, I would just add in
[SPEAKER_00]: some chunkier, um, mulch and maybe
something, um, a little more carbon rich,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just as aged and, uh, just to add
some, some of that variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as far as, uh, how things age,
um, do things have to be interacting with
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment to age or does it simply
need time to go by?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, the contrast I'm making is,
um, somebody who's got a pile of wood
[SPEAKER_01]: chips in the, in the corner of their yard
and they're getting rained on and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, warmed up by the sun and,
you know, they are, they are aging and
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking down versus um, for example,
this, this biomass that I was referring to
[SPEAKER_01]: that, um, it had just been sitting in
plastic bins in a shipping container at
[SPEAKER_01]: this hemp farm for three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, we need space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you just take this stuff and get rid
of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did, um, can something air quotes
age in a plastic bin, not exposed to the
[SPEAKER_01]: elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, time is passing, but biology may not
be happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a matter of moisture mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also when was that material
harvested before being mulch?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll kind of walk you through my
thought process on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the first thing is whenever it's
harvested, if it's, if it's a green,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's in a green vegetative state,
as opposed to, you know, and, and field
[SPEAKER_00]: ag, you have a lot of crops that,
uh, send all their sugars down out through
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots and then the above ground parts
of the plants become this like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, uh, brown, like dormant
state, uh, it's no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really no longer living above ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a carbon rich source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to harvest that,
um, material, I mean, I assume this would
[SPEAKER_00]: happen with a cannabis plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just leave it in the,
I don't think people really often do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you left it in the ground or left
it in your container and let it die back,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you come and chop it and mulch
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, that is going to be more carbon
rich and far less of concern from the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen perspective that we were talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you harvested it when it was green
and then chopped it up, you'd really have
[SPEAKER_00]: to dry that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where moisture comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to dry it before storing it in
plastic bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, because if you were to just,
uh, you know, chop it when it's green and
[SPEAKER_00]: then mulch it while it's green and then
put it in a plastic bin, even if it had a
[SPEAKER_00]: lid on or it lit off of it, whether it had
a lid on or off, it would probably be too
[SPEAKER_00]: moist in that volume and start getting
funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd start losing the night,
the nitrogen, um, in that material because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actively breaking down and it'd
probably be doing it in a pretty stinky
[SPEAKER_00]: way, which is often anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you'd really want to dry that
material on a tarp or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can put it in your,
uh, your bins and save it, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer aging in terms of
decomposing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that's desired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I do this whenever I want to save a
high nitrogen material for a future
[SPEAKER_00]: compost pile that I'm not yet ready to
build, but I want to make sure that it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually maintains its high nitrogen
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to do that is to dry that
material before storing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, you just lose all that
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then it would, it would,
uh, become anaerobic and problematic in
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that was a lot of information,
so I'm going to check in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, this is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never actually thought about mulches
as, as much as we have really dug into
[SPEAKER_01]: them today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I just, I just looked at our
timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done almost, almost, uh,
an hour second set, like essentially on
[SPEAKER_01]: mulches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, I'm glad that like,
you know, we really, the goal of this was
[SPEAKER_01]: really to get people to understand,
um, how to think about mulches so that
[SPEAKER_01]: people can use whatever they have near
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because we, we don't, we certainly
don't want people to like purchase stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and ship in their mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's mulch all around us,
unless you're living in a city and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then maybe still then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I think that, um, we have
effectively gone through mulches that so
[SPEAKER_01]: people can think about what do they want
in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I going to age it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I going to apply it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this kind of like system of
thinking through it can be applied to
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever folks are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I think, I think that, uh,
even though it went longer than I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: we were going to, we definitely hit the
mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, what I think I'm going to do
though, let's, uh, let's move,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, talking about cover crop to the third
set and, and wrap up this set right now
[SPEAKER_01]: and go to commercial and then,
and then we'll pick up with a cover crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, when we come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, uh, you are listening to shaping
fire and my guest today is soil biologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: Andy Marsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a peat moss replacement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_01]: container growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But organic growers are recognizing now
that peat moss is an unsustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: resource and the mining of peat bogs
destroys wetland habitats and releases
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestered carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But peat moss works so well, that many
have continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there is finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that provides
[SPEAKER_01]: better benefits while being a sustainable
choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems is actually made from upcycled
organic paper and cardboard headed for
[SPEAKER_01]: landfills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_01]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption, and water
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades long
[SPEAKER_01]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss is lightweight and easy to use
and pit moss is inert so it won't change
[SPEAKER_01]: your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Available in a range of preparations
including a nutrient enhanced blend and an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic soil conditioner with no added
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding for horses, chickens, and small
[SPEAKER_01]: animals.

sustainable plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, but also as a bio-stimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shangalos, and my guest
today is soil biologist, Andy Marsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are with the big finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start off by talking about
cover crops that we bumped from set two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to talk about good
strategies for waking up your pots in the
[SPEAKER_01]: spring so that you can preserve all your
gains from the prior year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Andy, when it comes to cover crops,
it seems that we kind of need to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: choice about whether or not we want to do
a mulch or a cover crop, because the mulch
[SPEAKER_01]: would then be on top of the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we have the mulch on top,
we're not really going to, I don't think,
[SPEAKER_01]: going to plant the cover crop into the
mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really is a, you got to pick one,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it kind of depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on your cover crop and
how it gets morphology, because something
[SPEAKER_00]: really delicate and low growing,
I agree with you, you probably wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to double up on those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or really, I'd just encourage like a light
mulching in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you can, I think mulching in
general, even if you're light handed about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, is always a good practice and that you
can do so effectively with your cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're doing something that's
really, really short, you'd have to use a
[SPEAKER_01]: lighter hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you did something that was like a
bigger plant, say, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a, while it's not my favorite,
a lot of people really like red clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could potentially start your red
clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once it has grown above the tops of
your containers, then go and add a mulch
[SPEAKER_01]: beneath the red clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that way, you're having both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that way you're having both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, depending on your
mulch, you could get away with mulching
[SPEAKER_00]: lightly, before that cover crop
germinates.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's light enough and they're
able to get the microclimate they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate, you might find that you can get
away with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that I think about cover crops
is that it's a really intimate exercise
[SPEAKER_00]: with your cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very specific practice for you
within the context of your particular
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an exercise in understanding
critically thinking and then researching
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that might make sense for your
specific context.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that idea that it's something
intimate and it's very much to your kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of growing style and your growing
preferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, one of the reasons that I
don't personally like red clover is
[SPEAKER_01]: because it grows up into the lower
branches of my camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I personally don't use it,
but people who aren't growing in smallish
[SPEAKER_01]: containers like I am, where I've
traditionally been in seven gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: containers, but moved up to 20,
versus some of the regenerative farms in
[SPEAKER_01]: California that are using 300 gallon grow
bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they've got lots of room for red
clover in a big bag that size,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas for me, I need more of a petite
cover crop because there's just not a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of surface area in a seven to 20 gallon
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about the things that we're
hoping the cover crop is going to do for
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one that you mentioned earlier in
the set is that it helps keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere alive because it is a plant
and it is feeding the microbes through its
[SPEAKER_01]: root structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would put that probably at the top of
the list of the good thing we're wanting
[SPEAKER_01]: for it to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A second thing is something we talk about
on the show a lot, which is it helps the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the soil from going hydrophobic
because each one of those little stems
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going into the soil are providing
a way for water to get into the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: creates these like little tunnels for them
to get down into the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third one that we talk a lot
about the show is that if it happens to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a cover crop with a canopy, there's a
space between the top of the soil and the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy of the cover crop, which creates
its own kind of bio region and can trap
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture and be a home for insects and
others that live on top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have a more active food web
over the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the three things that I most
think about, but I bet you've got some
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are other good reasons to have a
cover crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love that last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of it as like a habitat,
just like you described.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add that the cover crop can also
provide additional nutrients into the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere and not just through the
exudates that are feeding the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other ways, so like your legumes,
for example, anything that's able to fix
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen is a really strong example of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's other plants that will be able
to bring about more calcium or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: taking up something that you actually have
too much nutrient and you actually want to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove that excess through a cover crop
that would kind of fall under
[SPEAKER_00]: phytoremediation and cover crops can be
really useful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be the only thing that I'd
add to your list there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a great list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you just explain for folks who are
like, you know, they're listening to this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode because this is all new to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you just explain nitrogen fixing
what that goal is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh, I love this topic so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to keep me,
keep me concise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but in general, nitrogen fixing
plants are a miracle to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nitrogen, the only way to get
nitrogen into even just into biology in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, including you and me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, nitrogen is the backbone
of amino acids and proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all, every living thing requires
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way that nitrogen gets into
life forms is from, from the atmospheric
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen going through some kind of
process in the soil and getting into
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our food web.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, nitrogen, it has a triple bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's an N2 molecule atmospheric
nitrogen is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means one nitrogen atom is
connected to another through a triple
[SPEAKER_00]: bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, really difficult to
separate the two to then, um, allow it to
[SPEAKER_00]: become something like a nitrate,
um, and be taken up into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's really cool is that these
nitrogen fixing plants like legumes,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, as well as some free living organisms
that do nitrogen fixing, um, outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants entirely is that they've found a
way to break that bond and start this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cycling of nitrogen into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by using these plants, it's
essentially capturing wild nitrogen and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and packing it into your soil so that your
plants can use it next summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's probably enough on cover
crops there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so let's, let's move on to what was
going to be the start of set three before
[SPEAKER_01]: we, we bumped cover crops over,
which was, I was going to start with this
[SPEAKER_01]: very dramatic question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's talk about worst case scenarios
that, um, that we want to avoid with our
[SPEAKER_01]: containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I could really only think of two,
which would be number one, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: your container freezing solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because I don't know this for sure,
but I would think that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: unlike the ground, which will probably not
freeze solid because of the ambient warmth
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that the earth has a container could
actually freeze solid to the point where
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing it could, it could wipe out
huge swaths of, of the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the microbes have water in them
and, uh, under freezing conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would, you know, those water
molecules would freeze and effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that, that would be bad news to
have, to have all the water in your pot
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially freeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second thing I considered was
that, um, you kind of want to be aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: the containers to make sure nothing gets
deposited in the, on the top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: container that might cause, uh,
the biology to be thrown out of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm not like entirely certain what
that would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was, I was trying to think of like,
you know, you know, passing animals,
[SPEAKER_01]: feces, like, you know, a dog or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I would, I would tend to
think that the pot would be able to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to deal with that very likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I was thinking about like,
you know, one of the farm hands laying
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you know, a can of soda that's
partially drank, and then it gets knocked
[SPEAKER_01]: over by the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now suddenly you've got half of a diet
Coke in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so you probably just want to like,
like just be aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, you know, occasionally walk your
field and just make sure that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, chaos has not arrived on
the top of your containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, when you mentioned that just now,
I was thinking of somebody tossing out the
[SPEAKER_00]: last little bit of coffee onto their
plants thinking like, oh, here's some
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, okay, that's, that might be
fine here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're in really small quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you, if it's always the same plant
that's closest to wherever you're standing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field at the time that you finish
your coffee, like it can become a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, you know, being mindful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about the idea of home
growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, this is, this isn't something
that scales well, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got a neighbor who actually has
got a whole dug in their, on their yard
[SPEAKER_01]: and they do five twenties every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they put their 20 gallon pots,
like they bury them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in their, in their thought,
the geothermal temperature will keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere in the pot like safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also allows the migration into the
pot of other diverse life forms that are
[SPEAKER_01]: already in the soil because the,
the oil, the oil, the hole that he dug is
[SPEAKER_01]: deep enough that he's got about,
I don't know, maybe eight or 10 inches of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that he puts on top of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by his theory, it's actually,
he says, he says it's, it's inviting all
[SPEAKER_01]: of these soil inhabitants from his yard to
like, come on in, come on into the
[SPEAKER_01]: container for the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all sorts of like interesting
foods here that you don't normally get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he attracts all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when he pulls them out in the
spring, they don't have to wake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they've kind of been awake all
winter and they've got more biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I like the idea of that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it all, it all is sound to me,
just hearing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's, yeah, the,
the only reason that that would work is
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's taken good care of his pots
and created a habitat for organisms to be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in enough in joining,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The invitation is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that it's buried and able to
stay warm, much warmer than if it were
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed above ground is, I mean,
it sounds labor intensive to dig such a
[SPEAKER_00]: large hole, but you know, if you have the
means and I say go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he, he's a retired person with a lot
of time on his hands and he loves,
[SPEAKER_01]: he loves to tinker and experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like going over there, all sorts of,
odd, odd labor intensive things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So earlier in the show, we talked quite a
bit about how to devise a fall compost
[SPEAKER_01]: tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it gets really cold and things are,
you know, things are frosting over and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe we're starting to get, you know,
nights in the thirties and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing we want to stop adding
compost teas because we don't want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: packing our containers with water once
they start getting cold because that extra
[SPEAKER_01]: water will expand and could actually cause
damage to the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thinking we, we want to do what,
you know, the, the, the big compost tea
[SPEAKER_01]: before the frost and then don't add any
more water or is the position like
[SPEAKER_01]: actually making sure they get watered over
the winter is good because they're less
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to cyst up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you want to be mindful of moisture
levels because if they get too low,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will have some loss in your,
your microbial populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, I'm holding space for
the idea of it freezing through,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is hard for a Texan like me to
really empathize with because I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never experienced it firsthand,
but I, I'm sure that happens up North.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's probably when you least
expect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I'd say trying to find some kind of
middle ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if that means keeping things
pretty moist on the front end,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as those temps get colder and colder
and there's a greater risk of freezing,
[SPEAKER_00]: then yeah, that you back off and you make
sure that, um, priority number one is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not, uh, complicating any of your
equipment, um, by, by freezing and also
[SPEAKER_00]: not killing off any of the organisms that
are freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like, are you going to lose
them to freezing or are you going to lose
[SPEAKER_00]: them to them not getting enough water?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's your job to be in tune enough
with when you choose to pull which lever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably a big bio region
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you pointed out in my head,
um, you know, pots never run out of water
[SPEAKER_01]: because I live in the Pacific Northwest
and my winter is all rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you happen to live in the part of
the country where your winters are cold
[SPEAKER_01]: and dry, well then, you know, you actually
might have dehydration issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to, it's good to make sure
that you are cultivating for where you
[SPEAKER_01]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could just as another option,
you could consider, uh, removing the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: from your pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you tell me if this is a
feasible idea, but, um, having that in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with soil, whether you're slightly
burying it or just kind of mounting it
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in a really thoughtful space,
maybe behind a windbreak or an area that's
[SPEAKER_00]: like pretty well protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'd, you'd be able to, um,
again, have migration occurring in that
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario and have a better chance of the
microbes surviving in some capacity and
[SPEAKER_00]: less concerns about freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only downside to this is the amount of
disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then when you come in in the spring,
you're disturbing that soil in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: put the soil into the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and that's not ideal,
but it's also again, comparing that
[SPEAKER_00]: reality to what happens when you leave
that pot exposed all winter long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say that that disturbance,
um, might actually be the lesser of two
[SPEAKER_00]: evils there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you, when you first suggested that my
thought was, Oh my gosh, it's just going
[SPEAKER_01]: to wreck the mycelium networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if let's say you live somewhere that
gets really cold, like, um, like I imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: Montana to be, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've seen enough movies where,
you know, nature just seems too free
[SPEAKER_01]: solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so if you've got extreme
situations like that, a, a 10 gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: container on your deck, it's probably
doesn't have a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and so if you were to make a pile
of all your 10 gallon containers of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: just the soil, yeah, you'll beat up the
mycelium networks, but at least they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: all, they'll all essentially be huddled
together for the cold season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's again, just kind of thinking
critically about these things and
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing one option to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not getting too dogmatic about it,
just because you saw someone on TikTok
[SPEAKER_00]: swearing by their method of overwintering
their pots doesn't mean it's the best
[SPEAKER_00]: method for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, let's go into this, uh,
last area, which is let's talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: waking up the pots, uh, in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, let's assume that we, we did all
of the things right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we did a, a late season, fungally
dominant, um, uh, compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also did a, a protozoa
infusion in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had a really nicely blended,
uh, top mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were grown a cover crop that
was helping keep the microbes fed over
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we find ourselves in the spring
and, um, uh, we want to transition our pot
[SPEAKER_01]: back to a position where it's ready for us
to, uh, bring in our clones, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: or our seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we want them to just like
immediately get into this wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship, uh, and reform a rhizosphere
and take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, what hints would you give us to
ease that transition for the microbes from
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're getting their food and the
plant to be warmly embraced by the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so it's important at this point that
you're not providing too many synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really we, if we're thinking
biologically, we don't really want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: using many synthetic nutrients at all,
um, because they can kill microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but especially during this early
establishment phase, it can be tempting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just want to note that,
um, when we, when we provide those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients directly to the plant,
it's disrupting that engagement between
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes and the root exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is only going to generate those
root exudates if it has needs that need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be met, um, by the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I just want to caution
against getting too tempted by providing
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of synthetic nutrient boost and
instead focusing on, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: maximizing the inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your job is to make introductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're bringing in the microbes,
um, so that they can start responding to
[SPEAKER_00]: those exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similarly, you don't necessarily need
to be all that focused on providing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of microbial foods because we want them to
be getting their foods now from the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and start creating that relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would that make a suggestion that we,
we don't want to do a heavy spring compost
[SPEAKER_01]: tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you, I think you can do,
um, you definitely want to do a compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea, but this time be more focused on the
inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is where extracts might
actually be become, um, of greater
[SPEAKER_00]: interest to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, doing more frequent extracts rather
than big batches of like nutrient rich
[SPEAKER_00]: tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and I say this in terms of maybe,
you know, you can certainly do a tea,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't go, don't go too heavy handed on
it because your goal is if you find
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself tempted to be adding tea,
um, super regularly in the spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe start alternating with an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, an extract is just the micro,
you're not adding foods, you're not having
[SPEAKER_00]: a brewing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's just less dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, Jeff Lowenfels, uh, says that
early in the season, you, you want your
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes to be, um, you don't want to make
them lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to make it too easy for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want them to get to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sounds like what we're describing
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want them building, um, not,
not laying around because there's all this
[SPEAKER_01]: easy free food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is, is there anything that we need to
do or is there anything that we can do
[SPEAKER_01]: that can support them changing the food
source, uh, from the compost teas to back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the, the, the root exudates and such,
or, or does that just, they probably
[SPEAKER_01]: prefer the exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as soon as we put a plant in there,
um, it will, they will naturally just
[SPEAKER_01]: switch on their own, you know,
cause we're just trying to decrease as
[SPEAKER_01]: much transition time as possible.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and there is a level of patience
that's always required here because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a very young plant that's not yet
pumping out lots and lots of exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, because of its limited
capacity to photosynthesize, it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: small surface area to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think just tapering off and
knowing that like leading up to planting
[SPEAKER_00]: day, um, to go really light handed,
like little to no microbial foods are
[SPEAKER_00]: being added during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did that work in the winter to get
your microbes through winter and have
[SPEAKER_00]: food, um, to, to sustain them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now as you're transitioning into
planting, um, you're, you're going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, back off in terms of feeding the,
the microbe foods again, so that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, when that plant gets in there,
they can start creating their
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it gets to a certain stage,
um, there shouldn't be a limiting factor
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you know, you might, in,
in terms of using my microscope to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: these things, um, of what's really going
on in the root zone, you might see like a
[SPEAKER_00]: drop in your biomass during a phase where
you've put a young plant in, into the
[SPEAKER_00]: container, but it kind of turns a corner
at some point, uh, once it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesizing and pumping out those
sugars to feed the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because it's, um, it's fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am not thinking about, you know,
growing right now, right now I'm feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: tired from the summer and I'm glad I'm not
like, you know, farming right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you know, you talking about these
like healthy thriving pots and these young
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, I'm like, Ooh, like start the
season, start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved, I love thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got, we got five months, man,
like chill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've got a while, but, um,
you know, there is something inherently
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting about thinking ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the fresh season every year,
you'll, you'll look like you have
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginary plant friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're out there tending to your pots
with no plants in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's, uh, just as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, Andy, thank you so much for
being a guest on shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, um, I've, I've always been
interested on things that I can do to get
[SPEAKER_01]: a, a jumpstart on the, on, you know,
next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm usually I'm thinking about,
well, let's, let's make an FPJ,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's make a fertilizer, let's make sure
that the compost is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the idea that I can, um,
pay attention and use intention,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, with the soil that is in my containers
and the earth so that, um, I don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: put in as much work every spring to get
the micro machine pumping along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm glad to have, you know,
a better understanding of how to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of these things too,
the, the cover crops, the mulching,
[SPEAKER_00]: the adding of the microbial foods and the
inoculation, the biology itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all contributing to so many
different areas that benefit us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just about plant nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also about that soil structure we
talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really undervalued or
it kind of goes unrecognized a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times come, come springtime, just how
valuable that it can be, um, to have a pot
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been nurtured and has a really
healthy structure that's prepared to
[SPEAKER_00]: become home to that young plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's kind of like moving into a
neighborhood that has a good vibe and lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of friendly neighbors, as opposed to
something that's, you know, a neighborhood
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been really neglected and desolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's, let's, let's all get to
making good neighborhoods for our,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for our plants to move into in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much, Andy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed our conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to find out more information
about Andy Marsh, um, there are two great
[SPEAKER_01]: places to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, first, uh, you can go to her
Instagram, which is at soil is sexy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, her Instagram is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do you, will you learn lots of,
um, you know, good best practices for
[SPEAKER_01]: taking care of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there's all sorts of interesting,
um, uh, microscopy posts and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: great, like pictures of, of slides and
such.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you are either interested in
microscope science or, um, actually don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know much about it, like me, uh,
it's a great place to start where you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can pick up interesting things without
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, necessarily like you having
to read a whole book, you can get,
[SPEAKER_01]: get little bits here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's, it's fun to follow along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now if you are, uh, more serious than
that, um, you definitely want to check out
[SPEAKER_01]: Andy's sub stack, which is, uh,
rhizos dot sub stack.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's rhizos R H I Z O S where you're
going to, um, uh, find more of her,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, writings and scientific thought than
the kind of, you know, Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a little bit, sometimes science
light sub stack is, is, is where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you decide you want to,
you want to read something serious,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's right.
