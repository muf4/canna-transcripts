[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason why I wanted to come over
and talk to you today, Patrick,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that I got turned on to your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Happy Endings Tea Mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was visiting Wonderland Nursery,
just south of here in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was Kevin Jodry who told me about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had one of your big, you know,
55 gallon drums or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was all excited that it had just
gotten delivered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm all like, all right, well,
if Kevin Jodry is in the inspiration to
[SPEAKER_02]: me, and I, you know, I take his advice as
being really high quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's all excited because he's got a
new 55 gallon drum of your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all like, what the hell is this
product, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it because there's a few bags in it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can admit, I don't have a lot of
experience with compost tea, but I had
[SPEAKER_02]: some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I used yours, and it did two
things that I had never really come across
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, the stuff foamed an amazing
amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it was coming out of my buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna ask you about the foam in a
moment, but my response was, if I think
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for foam, and this has got a
ton of foam, maybe that's some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: benchmark of good, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, all right, I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the real test was when I started
pouring it on my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was feeding, you know, once to,
you know, once and a half, or two times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes a week with it straight at 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I was also diluting it down to
like 30% and using it foliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took under a week for everybody to
perk back up, the colors to darken.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know when the plants are in a
really good mood and sunshine,
[SPEAKER_02]: the leaves come up, and they like what we
call praying, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's praying or saluting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started, so then I started like,
I kind of started hunting you down and we
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed paths a couple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now, I'm to the point now that I'm
recommending this to people.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm realizing that it would be good
for everybody if I stopped by here at your
[SPEAKER_02]: lab and asked you some of the general
questions that everybody asks me so that
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of me trying to do it myself every
time, I could just like send them the
[SPEAKER_02]: link, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, so the first couple of questions I
have for you are going to be real basic
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then I've got a couple that
for the people who already know about
[SPEAKER_02]: compost tea and are interested in know
more, and then we'll be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so let's, let's start at the very
basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people, especially the
indoor scene, um, folks have been trained
[SPEAKER_02]: to use, you know, bottled nutrients,
some of them synthetic, some of them high
[SPEAKER_02]: in salts and, um, and, you know,
they all have different roles,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, the, the natural,
the organic, the healthier compost folks,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of them come back to, you know,
you can dump almost all of that stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: just go with compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, a lot of people are like,
all right, I know compost tea is good,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so what, what is it about compost tea
that makes it so great for both your
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plants and like also your food
and ornamental plants at home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all plants, it's, it's actually an
amazing thing that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: research going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, basically what we're looking at
is in nature's way of feeding plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's done through a biological system in
the soil between the roots and the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: with, uh, they call it the mycorrhizae
system as a general term, which involves
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots, uh, bacteria, fungus,
different, different little animals in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what a compost tea is,
is you're, is you're making an incubator
[SPEAKER_00]: for those, those beneficial organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helped feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, a compost tea, tea brewer is a
water, air, and, um, and, um, your initial
[SPEAKER_00]: starting, whatever you're starting with
bacteria, either, either from worm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings or a powdered mycorrhizae that
you can buy that they've cultivated in
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makashi is another good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, root balls from local healthy soil is
another good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically the, the idea of a compost
tea is your, is your incubating the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And feeding it back into your plants,
you know, million fold, a billion fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just boosting that natural
system up into overdrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing you have to be weary of is
that the tea brewer is an incubator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be careful of what,
you know, what you put in is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply under the right circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to stay away from fresh guanos
for E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, because then you could actually
create a biohazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard tales of a few people here
who have people getting sick over it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but basically you're going to incubate the
biohazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your product doesn't have any guanos,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use guanos,
which you can, if you want more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer tea is I suggest you add them
after the brewing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not a chance for the,
um, multiplication to happen, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically compost teas in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are an amazing, there are many
ways to brew them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they do benefit almost every plant
I've ever put them, put on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, citrus growers in Florida are,
are big on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it just boosts that natural
biology in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're taking, you're taking a,
like a living soil environment where you
[SPEAKER_02]: would normally have these healthy
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by, by brewing a comp toast tea and
adding it, you're creating this like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like bionic soil where, where everything's
so much more thriving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do I understand it correctly?
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that, you know, generally speaking,
what's happening is this, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: this microbe community that you're
feeding, which is, is, is, is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is the area around the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It essentially makes a buffet in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever your plant, whether it be
cannabis or whatever, um, all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: inputs that the plant wants are there at
its beck and call.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't have to struggle to get
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's a big misconception is,
is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to add phosphorus when it's
flowering, but in nature, if you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, a fruit tree doesn't go to
another area when it needs nitrogen or it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's there, it takes it when it needs
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the research that's done is
there's a little receptors that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: leave the root to look for what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be a receptor for nitrogen or
phosphate or, or, or potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah, if, if you build a real
healthy soil, you know, it takes things
[SPEAKER_00]: when they, when they need it, the salt
based nutrients are charged particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you put them in water,
so that's basically the mechanism to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, nothing will move in nature unless,
unless it's being pushed or pulled and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's either gravity pulling it down or
plus and minus charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, and that's, and so salts are
really a delicate thing because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of force fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like shoving an IV into the
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has no, the root has no control of any,
any, it's kind of like force feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually much like force feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so there is a place for salts in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are good transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, it's kind of, I look at it like a
meal, you know, we, we eat things that
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every culture in the world eats things
that used to be alive because it has all
[SPEAKER_00]: the elements of life and things that used
to be living.
[SPEAKER_00]: But adding a little bit of salt or spice
is really important for that meal to taste
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look at a lot that way in nature,
you know, there's some good natural salts
[SPEAKER_00]: to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never use a synthetic salt,
but Epsom salt is one natural salt that's
[SPEAKER_00]: real good magnesium source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, carbon based nutrients are
kind of the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, for a while, yeah, the industry
was real big on salts, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, they're tricky to use and they
can burn plants and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is not good at as good as
organic, you know, a miracle grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, not as good as a, a chicken or
chicken poop tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know that my, my parents'
generation, you know, everybody was in
[SPEAKER_02]: love with like chemistry and technology
and science was going to solve everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and sometimes you go down that
path enough and you realize, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually if we come all the way back to
how nature does stuff itself, we're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually going to get much better results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know where the salts originally
came from?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were leftover bomb making material
from world war two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and so the nitrates are very,
so they were trying to figure out ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out plants, you know,
it was like, you know, putting plants on
[SPEAKER_00]: steroids, but they also poison the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They poison the water supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of downsides of the salt
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: A funny side note.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually once stopped at an airport
by TSA because I had not yours,
[SPEAKER_02]: but somebody else's compost tea packets
that I had gotten at a convention as
[SPEAKER_02]: samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and as soon as they read fertilizer,
they, they ran all the bound tests on
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I'm like, really,
dude, I'm just organic, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, but that was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ammonium nitrate is that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it triggered the supervisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's explosive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so, you know, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a compost tea brewer, when I first
learned about that, I'm like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get this like some kind of piece
of technology to be able to brew this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until I actually watched
some of your videos online that I realized
[SPEAKER_02]: that a compost tea brewer is not really
like some kind of sensational piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's essentially, oh, and I also realized
so, so you, you need to, you need to feed
[SPEAKER_02]: a, you know, oxygen into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I tried it with a, just a simple
aquarium bubbler, which didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: enough, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a pretty good size, you know,
still only like 20 bucks, but you do,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need a decent size air pump and,
and, and it's going to be bubbling into a
[SPEAKER_02]: five gallon bucket that you can get in any
hardware store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you put in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then, and then you put in the
product and then it just goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like it's a piece of gear,
but it's, it's not really basically you're
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a water sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a vessel for the water and,
uh, and the tea that you put in and a good
[SPEAKER_00]: air, a good air source.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a different methods of circulating
the water or air stones are real simple
[SPEAKER_00]: and cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get started for, you want a really
good air pump is as much as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go too big of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm an air pump, a good clean air
stone, some clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to stay with the chlorine is,
is in, in municipal water to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: biological activity from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the less chlorine, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, whether you're on a well or you
can dechlorinate your water in different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also collect rainwater,
which is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a great place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stream water, lake water will all brew
some amazing teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, the water is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water, the air and the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are kind of the main variables that you're
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as the inputs, there's an
infinite variety of inputs, but if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using good, healthy organisms that break
down soil, like what's naturally in a
[SPEAKER_00]: compost, what's naturally in the belly of
a worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the worm castings have all that natural
or, you know, biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to do is multiply
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the basic idea of a T and it
just turns out it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet you also have to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't talk a whole lot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for something to live,
it needs food, water, a place to live in
[SPEAKER_00]: and, um, and, and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're providing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the simplest form of food is,
is a sugar, because that's what the
[SPEAKER_00]: simplest form of food is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all, all life loves sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use molasses or any kind of
good sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can also use starches,
you know, fish have a lot of nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar, but it takes a little longer to
brew because you've got to break down
[SPEAKER_00]: those starches.
[SPEAKER_02]: With your product though, do you have to
add molasses?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a nice powdered molasses source.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not real strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the bark or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of flaky, but, um, turns out it,
yeah, it feeds them really nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's honestly one of the things that
I liked about your product because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm busy doing everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I'll read online that people
have got these complex recipes and all
[SPEAKER_02]: these things I need to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really I need this to be kind of like
a set it and forget it thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I needed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I just take the bag, you know,
or not the whole bag, but I scoop out what
[SPEAKER_02]: I need for my five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put in my air and I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like I need to make, you know,
also go get the molasses and all that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like the kind of one-stop shopping
vibe of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great starter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has everything you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if, if you could add some local
biology, like if you can go out to a local
[SPEAKER_00]: soil that's healthy and add some of those
root masses into that or, or worm castings
[SPEAKER_00]: or compost, that's all beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all just going to, you're going to
add it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty inside of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the meals, the fish bone in the
crab, they all covered in bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you put it in the water,
it activates and it all starts breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's plenty of bacteria in the tea
mix, but it never hurts to add some more
[SPEAKER_00]: if that's local.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my buddies who uses your stuff and
I, it was funny because I always thought
[SPEAKER_02]: his plants were good, but I didn't know he
uses your, used your stuff until
[SPEAKER_02]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually also takes just like grasses
from his yard and just chuck some on in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he started doing that for just simple,
like FPJs, like, like fermented plant
[SPEAKER_02]: juices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, well, I won't put it in my
compost tea too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and all of those grasses are
filled with, are covered by local
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And know that things like a place to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I have diametaceous earth in my
tea, which is a lot of surface area
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a real nice house for them,
but you want, some people throw in hay,
[SPEAKER_00]: just have them some surface area that they
can grab onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not just floating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like holding on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's easier for a lot of animals
to have a place to grab onto.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that you said they need a home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, that's, that's universal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to anchor onto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so now the part, I was really
interested in the foam part, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like I have, I, you know,
before I became a little more dedicated to
[SPEAKER_02]: your product, I tried some, some other
stuff and you know, since I'm in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, people are constantly giving me
stuff to trial and I try everything
[SPEAKER_02]: because I want to stay educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some of the stuff doesn't foam very
much, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you, you email their
customer service and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good product, but then I used your
stuff and it just like, it, it really
[SPEAKER_02]: foams well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not, you know, if, if,
if somebody is thinking about using it and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, oh my gosh, I don't want to
make a mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like it's always, it's not like
it's like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you've got a five gallon bucket,
sometimes it'll foam up an inch,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the foam is thick and so it stands up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not making a mess,
but, but intuitively, I want to think that
[SPEAKER_02]: some alive stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's making the foam and I don't
know if that's true or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what makes the foam?
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that's how I look, you know,
we're, we're, we're multiplying living
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms, living organisms produce CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once they, you know, they turn into
oxygen and sugar into CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, the foam is an indication of the
biological activity in the tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start off, there's very little
and then we'll go through a growth cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have to kind of figure out due to
your temperature, water conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much minerals in your water,
chlorine in your water, how much airflow
[SPEAKER_00]: determines the length of the brew time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually, I think it's a great
indication of, of where you're at in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tea cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're going to, the population is
going to increase and explode and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll start eating itself and the food's
gone and the poisons are in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, their excrements are in the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually poisons them and then
they'll die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the level of foam increases as,
how I look at it is it is CO2 foam is what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is at CO2 bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's coming from the living net and
it will go to a maximum and then die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually anywhere from two to five
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically it's two days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's CO2, I would say that it's
pretty fair to say that it's their,
[SPEAKER_02]: their exhalation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it might be their excretion too,
but one way or another, it's their,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's their waste product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any animal breathe in oxygen and mix it
with water and then sugar in your body and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you breathe out CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that is a good indication of
the biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then not only that, the smell,
I'm big on sweet, fresh, earthy smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the tea one has a little bit of
ocean smell because I have some fish in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but sweet and earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it will die off,
it will sour a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not big on using at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some people do, but at that point
I like just to toss it in the compost
[SPEAKER_00]: pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, so I brew my tea, you know,
I've got, I've made my little,
[SPEAKER_02]: my, my bubbler, my five gallon and I,
and I put my, my dose of powder in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and it foams up and I've reached my like,
like apex of foam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know everything's the most alive and,
um, and, you know, feel free to tell me if
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wrong, but at that point, um,
I will, uh, you know, take out the air
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, and I will use it in one of two
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either I will walk out to my garden and,
um, I've got a, you know, like a smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: bucket and I'll just like bucket it at a
hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I'll just put like, put a little
bit in, you know, whatever, how much I can
[SPEAKER_02]: spread it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put a dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you will, and everybody near near where
the stem is hitting the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, and then, and then I just
generally believe that I should finish it
[SPEAKER_02]: with a little bit of fresh water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gets down more towards the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also, you can dilute it before you
do that, but it's a little more work,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, carrying it around, but hand
watering is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's always going to be a biofilm
that, you know, some people like to pump
[SPEAKER_00]: it with drip lines because some of these,
they use it on big farms now and the
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation lines will get a biofilm
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand watering is labor intensive,
but it's probably the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use it absolutely fresh because you
can't bottle a living, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it dies in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shelf life would be like 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's not even that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know how long it is,
but some, there are some bottled teas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they can't be as good as a real fresh
right out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the maximum numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like brew it and use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the, in the bio, the good thing
about the biological activity is the bio,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bio organisms is, is they,
they're not really giving you MPK or any
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just facilitating the transfer of
the nutrients from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no real burning involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, you can dilute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people dilute it 10 to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use it pure, you know,
as, as a test, I like to maximize,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, push things to limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've used pure tea without any dilution
on every watering throughout a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, things are a little bit too
nitrogeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little, a little dark green,
but everything is very healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for people whose plants don't look
robust and dark green, like it's better to
[SPEAKER_02]: be on that side than the kind of emaciated
and kind of yellowing kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like the compost tea just makes
them, you know, camouflage green,
[SPEAKER_02]: like serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you mentioned about foliar
feeding, that that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, there's a lot of the good
things going on there, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in nature is looking for
somewhere to live and colonize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you, when you add compost tea to
the foliar, what happens is a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms populate the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when another mold comes along or a
mite or something, that's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: physically taken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding that high biodiversity to your
plant itself, you can't see it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does colonize on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice, it's a nice, nice natural way
for protecting your plant from a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're filling that vacuum where like a
spider mite or a powdery mildew or a
[SPEAKER_02]: future botrytis would, would become an
opportunist and jump in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, no, no, no, no, we're going
to fill it with these healthy microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's already somebody living there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many years in indoor, you try to,
you know, everything's so clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a real nice place for a predator
to come in or something bad and take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why indoor growers can have a
real problems due to there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity, you know, and the more
biodiversity you have the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm real sure of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so I've, I've sprayed foliar just
a handful of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still experimenting with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, actually the first time I did it,
I sprayed it at a hundred percent and I
[SPEAKER_02]: came back the next day a little freaked
out because I thought I had gotten some
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of purple powdery mildew and it
wasn't that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just that some of the droplets had
dried with the compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I just sprayed
everything off and learned from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but, but since you do use it all the
time, what percentage of compost tea to
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh water do you recommend for foliar?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's, that's a good,
and spraying too, if you have a really
[SPEAKER_00]: fine mist, there are some of those little
animals are getting kind of big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when those, when you get put in those
little micro bursts, it actually can shred
[SPEAKER_00]: them up and kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely don't want to have it on the
high mess when you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually like to, um, like when they're,
it's small, I dip them completely upside
[SPEAKER_00]: down into a fresh batch of tea that you've
dipped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do the plant did the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a flea dip or something,
but just completely coat the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, yeah, just, and also the tea
can have some residue in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you want to be, you might
want to strain it if you're going to spray
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but yeah, there's for mass scale,
big sprayers are fine, but just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: it a real fine nest and you should be
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just soak your, just do it before it's
flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we've already kind of
established that you can't really do it
[SPEAKER_02]: too much, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if anything, your plant might become
like, you know, very dark green.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in many cases, that's, that's better
than the opposite side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, if somebody wanted to do an
optimized amount where they are,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're benefiting the plant as much as
they can, but they're also not overdoing
[SPEAKER_02]: it because they, you know, a lot of,
especially patients, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on budgets and they, they want to
be able to use it, but not too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would you recommend as a,
as a good, regular feeding regime?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically what I do is I always like,
when I transplant, I like to water in tea
[SPEAKER_00]: to just to set that biological activity up
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little lazy, so I don't brew that
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might hit them three times, four times,
and you can actually water the day before
[SPEAKER_00]: you harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, you know, it's fine,
but you can use it to the very end,
[SPEAKER_00]: to end of the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones all the way to, to the very end,
you know, last days of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually hit them two or three times,
but I always like to hit them the first,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, once they're transplanted,
just to set up that extra biological
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, and another thing I
think is kind of important for
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive plants, I think there needs
to be a little bit of stress involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, don't overwater your plants,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to air, air on the side,
let them droop a tiny bit instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering and keep the roots wet,
because your roots are real important to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, that's the main,
where everything gets absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want a lot of surface area on your
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's one thing about the tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some, I actually have some
biological activity to strip the roots of
[SPEAKER_00]: that old brown scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should have nice white fluffy
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of engineered into the
tea, which I think kind of makes it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, makes it work really well,
is the number of ingredients I use to make
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy roots, because that's what,
that's where it starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't overwater the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, two or three waterings of
fresh water and a tea water, you should be
[SPEAKER_02]: fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so to kind of unpack that a little
bit, you're suggesting that, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: at, at the beginning at transplant,
um, maybe hit it, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: two or three times in a row, because
you're building up the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after that, like maybe every third or
fourth, I just hit it once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the first watering that when I try.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't use it throughout the whole
cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I do, but I'll use it maybe once.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first walk and then I might do
three weeks of regular water and then hit
[SPEAKER_00]: them with tea again.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they, when they transition from
vegetation to flower, it's a good time to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit them because they need, they need a
bunch of nutrients at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you suggesting that once,
so it's starting to think, I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: think about it more like an inoculant at
this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an amazing inoculant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm putting it in and I don't
necessarily have to do it again every week
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have a nice healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another, another issue is that if
you've used salts in your cell before,
[SPEAKER_00]: like another, one of those blood boosters
called mono potassium phosphate,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in all the big numbers for bloom
boosters that actually can just damage
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil and keep things from living and
actually lock out certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a good living soil starting
off with, yeah, you don't have to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, the plant feeds itself from the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want a real healthy soil and
that's what Ocean Valley does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it a real wide spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, build a super soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got, I got one more question
before we talk about how folks can get it,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, you know, I talked to a lot of
folks, especially when I'm at conventions,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all like, you know,
we're doing 50 acres, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and as soon as they say 50 acres,
I'm thinking of mids, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but a lot of these, a lot of these
growers, you know, who are even working
[SPEAKER_02]: big, a lot of these folks that want to do,
you know, healthy probiotic at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a lot of people who are
small batch compost tea, living soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe even Korean natural
farming nerds, like, like I am,
[SPEAKER_02]: they get to a point where they're like,
all right, well that's, that's fine for a
[SPEAKER_02]: home grower or a patient grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but, but we're going to do a couple
acres or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You already mentioned once that you
probably don't want to put the compost
[SPEAKER_02]: down your water line because there's
residue.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be aware of that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so maybe just put water down your
lines, but do you have any recommendations
[SPEAKER_02]: for people who want to scale it up to use
it at size?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my jobs is I inspect farms for a
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do see a lot of big scale farms in
Humboldt and Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you bake with us on these farms
are dry ingredients and big tea brewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there, you know, 250 gallon pallet
kind of square ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the minimum up to they'll
group, you know, three, 4,000 gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: tanks, but they're almost in every farm I
see now because they are so beneficial and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, they're so cost effective,
you know, as far as a, a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer you can add, you absolutely can
add in nutrients, you know, to feed your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually one of the most cost
effective ways, but it's done all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're, and they're just big
reservoirs that they grew it up in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for most of the commercial
growers, the things that they're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for are health of plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a, you just need that,
but also it helps resist pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and they want a good yields,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this absolutely, you know,
compost tea boots the yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then of course everybody
needs, you know, a bag appeal,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I have found and granted I'm
still pretty new at the compost tea thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but my coloration seems to go up the,
the amount and variety of the colors in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the, the hairs go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to think that there's more
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's true yet,
but it seems to boost all the categories
[SPEAKER_02]: that you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your end goal is to sell, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's some, there's some products
we use at home when it's just for our,
[SPEAKER_02]: just for our head, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but, but people who need to make
their margins, they need to worry about
[SPEAKER_02]: these other categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it does all of that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in that cost effective is real
important on big scale farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're, they're not using
bottom nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous to ship water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you add your own water on site and
you, you save a substantial amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, what was the question again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think you, I think you already
nailed it that, that yes, it does increase
[SPEAKER_00]: your yields, your bag appeal and it
maximizes the potential genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just allows that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It maximizes the potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think, you know,
that it's built in the genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, you're letting it express
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do usually get a lot more terpenes
and things usually, it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, you know, when you grow an
organic or a salt based furlough,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to quantify, but it's that,
you know, when you're using it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the market knows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market absolutely knows and people are
becoming more and more aware, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: the pesticides and that, you know,
you have to find other methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for years it was kind of a hidden,
you know, nasty part of our business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but the consumers are important
in, in, in they're more demanding as they
[SPEAKER_00]: should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the, definitely the direction I
see in the industry is definitely going
[SPEAKER_00]: organic and in high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's, that's what it's just
cost effective and it's a better product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually really excited about my
tomato plants this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, I grow, I grow a few every
year because you know, even though you buy
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato plants at the store, it's still
nice to have some at home, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, my tomato plants are near my
personal patient plants, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a few of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and so, you know, I give some of
my cannabis plants, which is why I
[SPEAKER_02]: originally got into it, but then like I'm
given some love to the tomato plants as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking forward to that experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Community gardens, I donate a lot and they
get amazing, amazing results in vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost teas help all plants, you know,
grad, you know, I think they use them a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot in golf courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's just really,
it brings, it brings out, it makes your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants healthy and inoculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great inoculate against,
against, um, it's just biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, you're, you're, you're,
you're, uh, supporting nature to do nature
[SPEAKER_02]: in like maybe a bionic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real interesting area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's just the tip of the
iceberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're finding out, there's tons of
information readily available on brewing
[SPEAKER_00]: compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, it seems a little,
a little daunting, but basically an air
[SPEAKER_00]: source, a vessel and some clean water and
start go from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, so I get my, my tea when I come
down here to, well, south of Istanbul,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I go down to visit, uh, farms and
stuff, I just get it locally down there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, I live up in Washington and
there's people listening, watching the
[SPEAKER_02]: video who live all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, where can people score this stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the happy, the, the happy endings tea
mix, like, like is it, is it easy to buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually we just got it on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like universal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I threw that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, go on Amazon and we'll get it,
or you can amass your local store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to be on store shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, go on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's universal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on Amazon, you'd want to Google happy
endings teamings, green bicycles,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is probably spelled a different G R
E A N.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so catch that it's green bicycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bicycles is the company, but it's G R E A
N.
[SPEAKER_02]: A brilliant marketing move.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it harder for people to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but anyways, yeah, if you search on
Amazon, you'll get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out there are people from
Maine to Hawaii that are actually finding
[SPEAKER_00]: out about this through word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine, but no, things are going real
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we want to sell a lot of it and,
um, we're just starting to, and really
[SPEAKER_00]: glad to come down to my laboratory so we
can talk about my product and thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you want to make it really easy,
you can look in the comments and in the
[SPEAKER_02]: first comment, there's going to be a link
to it on Amazon, which makes everything
[SPEAKER_02]: easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Hey, thanks for having me over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what's your website?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green bicycles.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also let's plug your YouTube channel
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, the first high times cup in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were using your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was you personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Okay.
