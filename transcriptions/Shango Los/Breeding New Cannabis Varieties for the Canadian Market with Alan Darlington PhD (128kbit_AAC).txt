[SPEAKER_01]: So Alan, thank you very much for taking
some of your valuable time to talking with
[SPEAKER_01]: me today here at Seven Acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason I wanted to talk to you is
because yesterday during the tour,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the grow staff were telling me
about how limited you were with the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics that you were able to choose to
grow from here in Canada for now,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And your role here at Seven Acres is
moving the company towards this new
[SPEAKER_01]: in-house genetics concern called Cambrian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to be having to help
develop the palette of colors that your
[SPEAKER_01]: growers get to grow with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start by talking a little bit
about the state of play right now in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada and what your artificial
bureaucratic limitations are to what you
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, we are limited by what's
legally available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a set of conditions where we have
to be able to buy our genetic products
[SPEAKER_00]: from an already licensed producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when day zero started, there wasn't a
reservoir of black market material that
[SPEAKER_00]: came in white all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to go looking for white material,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a very small number of
producers typically overseas that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: get these seeds from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody in Canada is basically tapped
into the same reservoir of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been trying to optimize that
ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to give folks an idea of how much
you have access to that's white,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning like legally accessible,
how many different chemovars do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to choose from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tens of, not hundreds of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's a very limited,
whereas the other markets have,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, hundreds of strains that they can
choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are down to tens of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really commoditizes the product,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If all of the LPs in Canada are picking
from this very small candy bowl,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of similarity in product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to really differentiate
yourself on the quality of the material
[SPEAKER_00]: because everybody, like you're saying,
is generating roughly the same sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, of course, creates a situation
where you want to start breeding more
[SPEAKER_01]: in-house so that in your role,
you can help the LPs that are involved
[SPEAKER_01]: with Seven Acres and Supreme, the family,
be able to widen their choices for plants
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so would you tell me a little bit
about Cambrian and how that is forming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cambrian is looking at just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at optimizing the genetics
that are available for use for licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: producers, while at the same time
optimizing the environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to optimize both the genetics
and the growing conditions for each of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're going to be doing is we've
gotten access to a fairly large pool of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that we've been working on
curating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be going through and
phytomining it initially and selecting out
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and then getting into more typical
breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytomining.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a new word for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this larger pool, is there going to be
a window where you can bring in new
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and so you'll be able to work
with those, not just the small candy dish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a window that's opening up in the
legislation that we can bring in material
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will be taking advantage of that at
Cambrian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're probably at the point right now
where you're scanning the globe for the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff you're most excited to breed with
and putting it all on deck to bring it in
[SPEAKER_01]: during the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to have a very full shop when
it opens up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what kind of actions are you taking to
identify those genetics around the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming that you're talking to lots
of breeders and lots of people who've been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this in the heritage years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're going through and again,
taking advantage of what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're not just looking at
what's happening and what's going to fit
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at it as a very long term
play is that when we're looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars we're bringing in that we'll be
using them not only in seven acres where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing full scale large production,
but also looking at the next phase of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to like optimizing for what's going
to be happening two years, three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: five years down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in the States we've had a lot of
challenges with people taking chemo bars
[SPEAKER_01]: that they love outdoors and bringing them
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, people taking chemo bars they
love indoors and bringing them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I live on Vashon Island in
the Pacific Northwest and we constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: have challenges because we love like a lot
of the sexy genetics in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a lot of that outdoor stuff doesn't
work when you bring it in and you do it on
[SPEAKER_01]: the Pacific Northwest Island where it
starts to rain the first week of October.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for you, you are choosing genetics for
a very particular indoor environment that
[SPEAKER_01]: also has glass up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are also getting sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So almost light assisted greenhouse,
but it doesn't really feel entirely
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your hit list of what you're
looking for in genetics that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring in that you can work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: At Seven Acres we have a very specific
clone to dock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pump through a lot of harvest in one
greenhouse and to do that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduling on this sort of scale we have
to have plants that come to mature
[SPEAKER_00]: maturation in a very set period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some very exciting things out
there that take 14 weeks to mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very set period of time and that
14 weeks just doesn't work for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing when we're looking at
specifically here is the time frame for
[SPEAKER_00]: maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within that though, one thing that I'm
really excited by is looking at how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neat thing with greenhouses is
everything's up for grabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more light, you put more light
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more water, you put more water
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in the Northwest, if it rains
today, you get wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing you can do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the greenhouse, you can make it rain
whenever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: To say, one thing I'm really excited by is
looking at that 14 week strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do with the environment to get
it down to fit our timeline?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we change the temperature regime?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we change the light to make these
ones that otherwise wouldn't be fitting in
[SPEAKER_00]: our system fit?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really hybridization of the
genetics and the production that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: them work here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was listening to your answer,
I thought I knew where you were going.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you were going to take these 14
weekers and then cross them to much
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter finishers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you end up somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you find a phenome in there that's
especially short and there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably going to be some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea that you want to coax the
bloom cycle to shorten by the environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was a surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: That must involve a lot of data
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you explain that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Data is your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, one of the things I was very
excited when I started here was just how
[SPEAKER_00]: rigorous they keep track of numbers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both going ahead, looking at what happened
if we did this, but looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: records, how you can adjust and see what's
happening with the various crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're saying about looking at
adjusting the genetics to fit,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because cannabis is really a new crop,
there's so much that we can learn with
[SPEAKER_00]: what we already have before we have to get
in there and start adjusting the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always use the example of the
agricultural revolution with time,
[SPEAKER_00]: money, genetics and production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been able to almost double
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every 10, 15 years for corn for the last
30, 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis, because it was illicit for
so long, it hasn't been able to take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the opportunity we have,
we can do catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can apply all we know about genetics,
all we know about production to get
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis up to the level of other
agricultural crops in a very short period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because you say that
cannabis is a new crop, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's a whole bunch of
heritage growers that cringe when they
[SPEAKER_01]: hear this because people are going back to
revolutionary era hemp and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis land races coming in during the
70s and 80s from Thailand and Mexico and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then modern day, the US is producing some
of the best genetics that have ever been
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all been doing this for all this
time and yet we have not had access to the
[SPEAKER_01]: materials that you've had with ornamentals
and other types of plants for generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suddenly we've got analytics and we don't
have to hide so we can spread out our
[SPEAKER_01]: space and we can have multiple grow rooms
and then all of this fantastic technology
[SPEAKER_01]: to take data about the plants as it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all get that it's like a brave new
world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you finding that the pace of
development and I'm not talking about GMO
[SPEAKER_01]: here, we're talking about traditional
hybridization.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much more quickly do you think that
that development of cycle increases now
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've got access to these types of
materials?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden we can take advantage of
everything and everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years it was, just to step back what
you're saying about the heritage side of
[SPEAKER_00]: it is one of the standards we always use
is can we at that scale produce what the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy and with that one or two plants can do
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still using the heritage as our
threshold and to do it at scale at that
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and quantity is really the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recognizing the great work that
everybody's done so far but being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: institutionalize it to make it a
production component.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is that we were saying
about making it jump ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden we can go to a university
and say you've got a genetics department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we buy some of your professors time to
work on this project?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we work with you on these sort of
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go to a major financial institute
and say can we work out a relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can help us fund this sort of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a slow burn like a nice warm
coal fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're throwing gasoline on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it interesting because I like that
you gave the nod to the quality of small
[SPEAKER_01]: batch craft, artisan flowers and that your
benchmark is to try to meet that quality
[SPEAKER_01]: but then also instead of having it in 25
plants that are all hand taken care of in
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody's basement you're doing these
huge grow rooms of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point the analytics and the
automation that you can fine tune become
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting when I did the tour
yesterday I kept on seeing all these
[SPEAKER_01]: really thoughtful automated solutions and
we had a little conversation with the
[SPEAKER_01]: staff about the classic phrase the best
fertilizer is the shadow of the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question was with all this automation
it's less time that the individual growers
[SPEAKER_01]: need to spend with each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the Matty one of your lead growers he
says but we're always looking for ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: add additional touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really understand that and he
explained to me that it's about we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: automate so all the plants are getting the
same love which frees up his time to spend
[SPEAKER_01]: more time with the individual plants and
see what else they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was pretty elegant because
I'm pretty staunch that hand watering is a
[SPEAKER_01]: great thing because you spend a little bit
of time with each plant but then when I
[SPEAKER_01]: see it rolled out at scale where okay
they're automatically all going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: watered the same and treated the same and
heated the same and the same airflow and
[SPEAKER_01]: these fantastic air socks that are
underneath the tables making the room very
[SPEAKER_01]: uniform and that frees up the staff to
give other sorts of care and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: surprisingly convinced right I'm not
that's not you know scaling is not usually
[SPEAKER_01]: where I come down but the proof was in a
pudding the plants looked fantastic they
[SPEAKER_01]: were thriving there was zero pest pressure
and they smelled good and then you know
[SPEAKER_01]: afterwards I got to try it and they tasted
fantastic as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bringing this all the way back to your
idea of breeding for these environments is
[SPEAKER_01]: that the target environment that you're
breeding for and what does that what kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of freedoms that does that allow you when
you're breeding for that cozy environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes that's one of the environments like we
are looking at this big picture like we
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking at this production in
greenhouse at scale and we're also looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the next phase which will be might be
growing in fields here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are looking at the whole spectrum
we're starting with the greenhouse because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where we're from and that's what we
know but we're also looking at the big
[SPEAKER_00]: picture but the freedom it's just like
you're saying is that we can get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point where every bud is exactly like the
other one and that we know everybody knows
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know we up and down the same
plant the quality changes from one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to the next quality changes and if you're
really talking about that premium quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product the guy who buys it wants that the
person buys it wants to know that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the exact same thing every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this time it's a dud next time it's a
head sort of thing you're not you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be cautious but if you know exactly
what you're getting each time and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can actually start looking at
saying well what do we want the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumer what does the consumer want
rather than saying what we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give them what do they want from us we can
start looking at environments that change
[SPEAKER_00]: the turpenoid profiles is that if you give
the water at this time of day what does it
[SPEAKER_00]: do to the lemon levels if you give this
quality of light what does it do to piney
[SPEAKER_00]: and all those sort of fine-tuning you were
commented on the the automation and that
[SPEAKER_00]: automation sounds like you're dehumanizing
it I look at it as a palette like painting
[SPEAKER_00]: is that if you have to mix every paint
color and set them up yourself you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be spending all your time doing
that you're not going to be doing any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the artwork if the if the computer
supplies all the different colors that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can add and change you can actually do
some pretty fantastic painting with that
[SPEAKER_00]: palette the changing of light quality
quantity can all do that so to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential of all the genetics we
develop we can optimize the environment to
[SPEAKER_00]: fit that particular plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that example that's great so so I
know that you are busy building Cambian so
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you go but thank you very much
for your time I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: you you
