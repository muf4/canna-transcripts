[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into today's episode,
I want to explain why it's been a month
[SPEAKER_00]: since the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, it's summer growing season right now,
and even though I'm not a professional
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, nor do I grow in volume,
here locally on Vashon Island where I
[SPEAKER_00]: live, I help out in a lot of different
cannabis patient gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do so much patient education,
I tend to make friends with folks who use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine, and they often ask for
a little help with this or that during the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there was a whole lot more of that
this year than ever before.
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more people are wanting to grow a
few plants to make their own tincture or
[SPEAKER_00]: RSO or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to see, but that's a lot more
people to help get set up and help
[SPEAKER_00]: identify deficiencies, and then stop by to
help them determine if a plant is male and
[SPEAKER_00]: when to harvest by looking at the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I got into this, this work with
patients, I chose to work in their gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than be in my office in front of
the computer pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also though, this is research and
development season for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summertime is when probiotic growers and
cannabis breeders are practicing their
[SPEAKER_00]: craft, and I got to go out into the field
to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier this month, I disappeared into
Humboldt and Mendocino for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks to record content for the YouTube
channel, and also find out what's new and
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting, and that is time that I'm not
in the studio making shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, these road trips without an
agenda where I just explore and meet
[SPEAKER_00]: people keeps the podcast and the YouTube
channel content interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from going on those kind of feral
trips that the energy and the ideas for
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping fire come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, next thing I knew it was August,
and it's been five weeks, and here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my own defense, I also did have two
guests postpone recording their episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: last minute because they too were also
busy getting their own full term crops in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk to them in November.

[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Kolem Reilly,
co-founder of Malibu Compost, an ultra
[SPEAKER_00]: premium living food web compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first heard Kolem speak about the
bioregionalism of microbes, I just about
[SPEAKER_00]: jumped out of my seat with curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that all of this living soil,
microbe community stuff we're all into
[SPEAKER_00]: actually differs by location and climate
really opened up a huge new set of
[SPEAKER_00]: variables and understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really had to ask him a bunch of
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're going to talk about
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to go deep, deep into
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Kolem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic to be here, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice to hear your voice again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started with some quick
basics because there's some people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: still pretty new to compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for people who don't know,
please give us a brief understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: what compost is and how basically it's
made at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's confusion around compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not to sound like the stereotypical
professor, but sometimes it helps to start
[SPEAKER_01]: with a definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, I'd like to give a
definition that actually just got reworded
[SPEAKER_01]: in the last year by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Composting Council, but it's important to
kind of break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they say is compost is the
product manufactured through the
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled aerobic biological
decomposition of biodegradable materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's undergone mesophilic and
thermophilic temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're reducing the weed seeds and the
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're stabilizing the carbon to make it
beneficial to plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a whole host of uses for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important to understand in that
definition that it's a controlled process
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's aerobic and biological
decomposition of materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so before we go to the biologic
decomposition, with aerobic, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen, what are the two thermics that
you, I don't know those two words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mesophilic and thermophilic refer to
different temperature ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll take this down to the home
composter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you pile a bunch of stuff in a
corner of your yard and come back a year
[SPEAKER_01]: later, that's not really controlled and
it's not really aerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's definitely some biological
decomposition, but you're missing two of
[SPEAKER_01]: those other factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as temperature, when you turn a
pile or cut into it, sometimes you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can put your hand in and
feel the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the temperature is one of those four
variables of the earth, water,
[SPEAKER_01]: air, and fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the fire aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a thermophilic process is when you
get temperatures that exceed 133 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of considered the proper
threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kills off weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll kill off pathogens like fecal
coliform or E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli or salmonella.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't really want that
thermophilic range to go much higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: 160 degrees where you start killing off a
lot of the beneficial microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can come back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a typical compost cycle, you want to
build the materials such that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: have airflow and the carbon and nitrogen
materials are mixed with moisture being
[SPEAKER_01]: another variable in such a way that the
temperatures can exceed 133 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that hot phase is considered the
thermophilic breakdown of the compost
[SPEAKER_01]: pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mesophilic is more sort of that
simmering down range as the temperatures
[SPEAKER_01]: drop under 130, but they're still well
above an ambient temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as getting to that temperature,
some people bake their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what you're talking about,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about letting the compost
itself generate heat from degradation and
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing its own temperature up,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one of the ways I like to break it
down when I talk to kids is think about
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes sweating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got a whole bunch of
microbes with a gigantic pile of food to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume, their job is to shred that food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, we have soil food webs called
shredders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are shredding and they are
sweating and they are working up steam,
[SPEAKER_01]: literally and figuratively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that breakdown is what's producing
that heat as you have this bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking down, attacking the surface area
of the materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they need oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't understand the
importance of airflow, but it's like any
[SPEAKER_01]: living organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need water and air and food to
survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during this process, with all that new
material that hasn't yet been broken down,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's largely when you see the
temperatures is in the first phase of the
[SPEAKER_01]: composting process where you have this
rapid breakdown and decomposition that's
[SPEAKER_01]: all run by these digesters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think of it, the compost pile is like
the digestive tract pre-application of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be a definition you develop
for kids, but that really gets right to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would be using that myself with
adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other part of your definition that
is really important is the aerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown because this is very
specifically oxygen-centric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you break out that part of the
definition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's two things, I guess,
in the broad sense of things that's
[SPEAKER_01]: important for your listeners to
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's what I would term intentional
composting and what I would term organics
[SPEAKER_01]: recycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of them have a very important
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say organics recycling is
trying to take organic matter and recycle
[SPEAKER_01]: it in such a way that you can derive
benefits and get the nutrients back out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it and reapply it to the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even a lot of quote unquote composting
facilities or operations or people calling
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves composters or even material in
the marketplace labeled as compost is
[SPEAKER_01]: really recycled organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been piled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been degraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of broken down and it's sort of
turned into this broken down black or
[SPEAKER_01]: brown material that's not as
distinguishable from how it started.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not necessarily a controlled
process, you know, with the biological,
[SPEAKER_01]: the chemical or the physical properties in
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So intentional composting is really
looking at what do you want out of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're looking for all the attributes
of compost, everything that compost is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're building the pile and
controlling the process to derive that out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need air.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the pile to breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a pile typically breathes from the
bottom and breathes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's allowing the microbes to
break everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turning the pile is critical because as
things compact, the oxygen, the space for
[SPEAKER_01]: free air space disappears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more things become compacted and
the more oxygen that's eaten up by the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes in the pile, there's no more
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what this leads to is anaerobic
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all you need to do is take some
material, put it in a glass jar and put a
[SPEAKER_01]: lid on it, a biological material,
and it comes back funky and putrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happens in anaerobic
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't really breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anaerobic conditions can cause a lot
of harmful microbes and other harm to your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants if that's not properly composted,
broken down, allowed to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygenation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second part is when the oxygen,
when the compost gets more towards a
[SPEAKER_01]: finished phase, it still needs to be able
to breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a finished process that is
typically called the curing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about a wine being
allowed to ripen, to have this expression,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a maturity and a balancing during
this curing phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also allows things like ammonia to
convert to plant available nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people now that you kind of hear
the definitions, you can understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can cut into a bag or sometimes open a
bag of commercial compost and you get this
[SPEAKER_01]: strong ammonia smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means the compost wasn't finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the microbes weren't finished
doing their jobs or it was exposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobic conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing happens with severely
compacted compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even on our farms or in your piles,
you'll find that oftentimes at the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can certainly turn that around,
re-amend it, keep working it, re-compost
[SPEAKER_01]: it for all intents and purposes as a way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea is to ultimately take it
through a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have the materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the proper ratios to begin with,
with the moisture and the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn the piles so you avoid the anaerobic
phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: You create hot temperatures to be able to
kill off the pathogens and the weed seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let it cool down and simmer and
finish during that mesophilic phase to
[SPEAKER_01]: where the compost is going to mature and
stabilize and be ready to do its job in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that idea about opening a bag of
compost and smelling the ammonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually was really startled the first
time I, you know, cause that's the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that I normally get, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stuff that I have historically
purchased is stuff you open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little damp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay, this is what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I did score a bag of your Malibu
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I opened it, you know,
it wasn't wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't smell like ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And visually it looked like really,
really high quality soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more granular with occasional
chunks and it smelled good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had that humus smell like you get when
you go out into the forest and you smell
[SPEAKER_00]: like the forest duff as you walk along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh my gosh, this must be
what it's supposed to be like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I got, you know, I picked up a bag
after I heard you speak for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, all right, this stuff sounds
crazy, I need to check this out for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then I'm like, wow, this really is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since our conversation is moving
slowly, but surely towards talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: micro bioregion and you and your company
ship all over, let's take that basic idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of how we make compost at home and scale
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've seen photos of your compost
piles on your Instagram and they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I've got a compost pile,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got like these long compost
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a huge pile that just goes on
and on and on that looks like it goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: for acres, you know, in the photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you give us a little idea of how
you take that basic idea of compost and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you scale it up so that you can make
a premium commercial product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we have those technicalities of
the scale up, we'll have a good basis for
[SPEAKER_00]: our next wave of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the principles are all still
fundamentally the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in your home compost pile,
if you're looking to get thermophilic hot
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures, you're going to need at
least one cubic yard of mass of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means at least three feet tall,
three feet wide, three feet deep minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically your compost will shrink
50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to build your piles much
bigger and they're going to shrink down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need to have enough mass to have
those microbes be able to generate that
[SPEAKER_01]: heat and break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understand that as a general rule of
thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I tell people home composting
systems, one of the simplest things you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: find is either a pallet system with four
pallets, one underneath and three on the
[SPEAKER_01]: sides, or a large kind of circular chicken
wire type of structure where you can make
[SPEAKER_01]: your compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need to have enough mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're doing the same thing on the
farm in terms of mass, but we're using a
[SPEAKER_01]: windrow system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a windrow is just essentially a
large long row.
[SPEAKER_01]: I typically build the piles no higher than
five or six feet tall, knowing that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to shrink and no wider than
12 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do use a compost turner to turn the
piles and kind of goes through it,
[SPEAKER_01]: turns the outside in and the inside out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also roll your piles with a front
end loader or a skid steer is one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially you're just building it in
a long structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same concept that you have enough
material in one place together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another consideration is obviously having
that proper carbon and nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can certainly talk more about that,
but that's where you hear people talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about your greens and your browns and
layering it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important no matter what you do
is understand the exact characteristics of
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you're using in that pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the piles shrink, you want to have
more material, but you sometimes want to
[SPEAKER_01]: start a new pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in home compost or people with
tumblers, they say the compost is never
[SPEAKER_01]: ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's hard to have it ready when
you're always adding brand new materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes a two bin system is great
where the one gets really tall and full
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you start a new pile,
you're able to kind of rework your old
[SPEAKER_01]: pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a commercial setting, I'll have the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll build a windrow five or six feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets 140, 145 degrees inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's steaming away and chowing down
and that pile suddenly shrunk from five
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half feet to three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for that secondary phase of the
compost, oftentimes I'll push two windrows
[SPEAKER_01]: together and combine them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's still enough mass to hold the
heat and finish the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other variable when you're dealing
with California and Oregon and winters and
[SPEAKER_01]: summers is you want to be able to hold in
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want too much surface area in
the winter months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you have to employ covers,
fabric covers that allow them to breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should do that for a home compost
pile as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes in the summer, I want to
trap the moisture inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to artificially add
moisture coming in with some type of a
[SPEAKER_01]: water wagon or something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But creating those ratios in the beginning
and getting that down is critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of scaling it up, the
principles are still the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I inoculate the piles using the
biodynamic method, I might have a windrow
[SPEAKER_01]: that's 100 yards long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm dividing that windrow into 12 or
13 different sections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each section is approximately,
for biodynamic purposes, I look at each
[SPEAKER_01]: section of the windrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every 7 to 10 tons of windrow is like
its own unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to inoculate that small part of
the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a long system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think of it as all these little
batches combined, much like somebody who's
[SPEAKER_01]: planting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have one plant that you're
treating as one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you might have a whole row that's
planted in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things you want to realize
is in between those plants, is a vast
[SPEAKER_01]: array of, for all intents and purpose,
biological intelligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oftentimes people think that their
little drip watering systems just at the
[SPEAKER_01]: base of the plant is the most efficient
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's efficient in terms of
overall water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at the grand scheme of
it all and really harnessing all the life
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the power beneath the soil that's
available to you, you're missing out on a
[SPEAKER_01]: vast array of biological intelligence,
of biological resources, and nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: resources that lie within the soil in
between those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they do communicate with each
other, whether you're paying attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dividing it into sections but really
keeping an eye at the really big picture
[SPEAKER_01]: is one of the important things of scaling
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third variable goes back to that
idea of intentional composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is selecting your materials with
meticulous care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for Malibu compost and for biodynamics
as a whole, it all starts with the cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can go into 100 different reasons
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of goes into that microbe
and the bio regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're looking at a clean, grass-fed,
organic dairy cow manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having that rich manure blended with
the proper carbon materials to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good carbon-nitrogen ratio to start
the composting process and blend it in
[SPEAKER_01]: such a way that we can pile it up where
it's homogenous enough to be able to have
[SPEAKER_01]: an even, controlled biological breakdown
and not end up, if it starts with chunks
[SPEAKER_01]: of hay and chunks of manure and chunks of
this, oftentimes you're gonna end up with
[SPEAKER_01]: a wide variation in the biological
decomposition of the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll find really hot pockets and
really cold pockets when it comes down to
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not having a homogenous,
even microbial controlled breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is what we're ultimately trying to
do even if we are scaling it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feeding the cows grass and leaving the
cows organic and not pumping them full of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals, that's fairly obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is your reasoning for
specifically using dairy cows?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should preface this by saying is one
of the most important aspects of making
[SPEAKER_01]: compost is use what's available to you for
all your local composters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find what's most readily available and
then work your way out and around your
[SPEAKER_01]: local region in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us at Malibu Compost, because we're
doing a bagged product, we really started
[SPEAKER_01]: with working backwards from what is the
most valuable, most superior, what could
[SPEAKER_01]: we think of as the best compost on earth
and then work backwards from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's brought us to biodynamic
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a number of different reasons
for that, but there's something incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: special about the cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the cow is a giant, digestive
fermentation machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cow, it's not meant to run and jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cow stands and eats and digests and
has four stomachs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a 12 days of that digestive
process from the time that that grass
[SPEAKER_01]: enters the cow's cud and starts chewing to
whether it comes out the other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all this fermentation and these
enzyme and these bacteria, but the cow,
[SPEAKER_01]: itself, and you see this now as research
is coming out, grass-fed dairy cow also
[SPEAKER_01]: produce specific compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them CLAs or conjugated lineolic
acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd have to ask somebody who's much
more of a chemist than I to really break
[SPEAKER_01]: that into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a link.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really what it comes down to is you
need high quality soil to create plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have high quality soil,
really healthy plants that are driving
[SPEAKER_01]: their mineral nutrition from the soil and
the air, this builds a high functional
[SPEAKER_01]: immunity in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plants that are strong and have strong
immunity and strong immune systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: that then gets transferred to us as humans
in the form of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds pretty simple, but eating
healthy food from healthy plants creates
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that all starts with the health of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of backs up to what goes in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've seen is that the cow,
it's not just the digestive process,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the cow is eating grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's eating local grasses that are grown
specific to this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can get into Alan's Savory and
rangeland management and grass management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably a whole nother show
for you if you haven't had one already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I direct people to Acres USA and a lot
of other resources that look at no-till
[SPEAKER_01]: and grazing and pasture management.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they all have something in common,
which is all these perennial grasses,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these local grasses that are
indigenous to different climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find 100 different grass types in
a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might find some weeds that are in
there, often considered weeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they might be performing a specific
function to create balance in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a cow out on grass is processing
biological material that's specific to
[SPEAKER_01]: that locale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's those local indigenous grasses and
pasture grasses that are passing through
[SPEAKER_01]: the cow, coming out the other end,
and fertilizing that pasture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nature knows what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nature has this incredible symbiotic
way of balancing itself out, if and when
[SPEAKER_01]: given the chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while it might sound like a stretch
of the imagination, I would go so far as
[SPEAKER_01]: to say that the cow's digestive system has
almost a perception, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: of what that grass and that pasture needs
for fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And between the grasses that it's grazing
on and the manure that's coming out the
[SPEAKER_01]: other end, and up to 25% of that manure
could be considered microbes, it's passing
[SPEAKER_01]: on the same fertility that's needed to
keep in balance and continually improve
[SPEAKER_01]: those pastures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're after in that dairy
cow manure, is all of those microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: is all of that balance, is all that
processing of those living native annuals
[SPEAKER_01]: and perennials and those grasses that are
just growing in harmony with the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of the nature of the dairy cow
industry, not all dairies are,
[SPEAKER_01]: because of land, are able to grow all the
forage that they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they end up often having much more
pasture land than they can for food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if they're not growing all their
own food on site, oftentimes they have
[SPEAKER_01]: land close by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of our farms that we work with in
California and Oregon have off-site hay
[SPEAKER_01]: pastures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they grow their own hay, still
vertically integrated, they just do it a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple hours away because of the value of
real estate, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we find there is still by
controlling those variables, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting hay that's imported from hundreds
of miles away or from different states,
[SPEAKER_01]: that who knows what it has in it,
but you're really controlling this
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial population in different regions
that are gonna have their own positive
[SPEAKER_01]: effect, not only on the soil, but it goes
then also into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plants that have a stronger native
soil, have stronger indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms, they're able to build a
stronger immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, much like humans that
are able to do well in an area where you
[SPEAKER_01]: grew up, or we see this with different
cultures, different cultural phenomenon,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the same kind of function of building
that immunity and building that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: health through building the soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our second set, we're gonna talk a
lot more about local microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as we wrap up this first set,
I was curious, you know, I admit to not
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing a lot about cows actually at all,
but you always, when you talk about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you talk about dairy cows, thus excluding
meat cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always wondered, was there something
about the biology of a dairy cow and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cow is, you know, at a part of her
life that she's giving off milk,
[SPEAKER_00]: does that add some kind of fertility to
her output in and of itself just because
[SPEAKER_00]: she's at that stage in her life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once a cow has given birth and is
producing milk through that lactation
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, there's a whole different set of
enzymes that become present in the cow's
[SPEAKER_01]: rumen and in the cow's digest,
in the cow's cud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, it starts in the cow's mouth as
they're chewing those grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's passed on, and we see,
you know, the fatty acids and the milk
[SPEAKER_01]: content, and we're able to analyze all
these different compounds in milk now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we can see through the growth of
probiotics and utilizing raw, grass-fed
[SPEAKER_01]: dairy cow milk for making cultures and
making labs and all sorts of, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can just do an experiment with
store-bought milk and with organic milk
[SPEAKER_01]: and with raw milk, and, you know,
you can see the difference in its ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to go through, you know, that process,
and that's really a reflection of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that mother dairy cow has these
different enzymes that are produced,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're looking for the same kind of
probiotic elements, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out one end of the cow that's
coming out in the form of the milk of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's not to say that there's a lot
of benefits to the male cow, and you see
[SPEAKER_01]: that because an organic male cow would be
considered out on grass, would be
[SPEAKER_01]: grass-fed beef, and grass-fed beef still
contains a lot of those same conjugated
[SPEAKER_01]: linoleic acids that you find in dairy
products, and these are compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: the body just doesn't produce them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need them, but the body just doesn't
produce them, and so this is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ways that you're able to get it,
and that same kind of fertility it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily in the composting process,
but I would encourage your listeners to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a look at the Marin Carbon Project
and the work of John Wick down in Marin
[SPEAKER_01]: with restoring the rangelands,
but we've seen that the fertility of these
[SPEAKER_01]: animals grazing after years and years of
not grazing on rangeland that has
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation year after year, one summer of
these cows grazing reverses the
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation of the land, and it starts a
carbon sequestration cycle through one
[SPEAKER_01]: application of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Furthermore, native perennials start
coming back, and the cows pick up weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: and over the summer months they become
much more lush, they gain weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can physically see the difference in
the coats of the cows, but really the most
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinating thing is what's happening
under the soil as this process of grazing
[SPEAKER_01]: and these nutrients getting restored to
the soil are able to literally reverse
[SPEAKER_01]: this problem of soil degradation and
sequester carbon, and that is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest opportunities that we have
available as we look towards our future
[SPEAKER_01]: and we look at these issues of global
warming and the amount of carbon and the
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge of growing healthy food and the
challenge of soil degradation and land
[SPEAKER_01]: that has been abused and soil that has
just died off after years and years and
[SPEAKER_01]: years of chemical synthetic conventional
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is Colin Reilly,
[SPEAKER_00]: co-founder of Malibu Compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_00]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum, and that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes sold by true terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are certified organic, non-GMO,
and food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that they are extracted from
real plant sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no solvents of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, terpenes from true terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is, other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you stack those terpenes to make
your blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes also have strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset
Sherbet, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_00]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_00]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
true terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose true terpenes for a top-shelf
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash true
terpenes to find out more, or click on the

[SPEAKER_00]: Using pesticides when growing cannabis has
been common for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, though, we know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that most pesticides formulated
for food crops have never been tested for
[SPEAKER_00]: use with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested to be eaten in tiny
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not been tested to be inhaled
and especially not concentrated into a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical residues from pesticides are not
healthy for anyone, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: especially dangerous for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: For commercial cannabis growers,
this has become very impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis enthusiasts and patients have
gotten educated enough that they avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who used pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but states across the
country have begun making pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: testing mandatory on all licensed cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time has come to find a better way to
fight garden pests than covering your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and chemicals, and there is a
better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let some good bugs fight your bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects and predatory mites
have come a long way since we were buying
[SPEAKER_00]: ladybugs online and putting them in the
grow room and just hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies Biocontrol can help you
solve pest issues without using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies founder Shane Young
learned best practices from working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry and has
fine-tuned those strategies specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: for large cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane works with commercial cannabis
clients across the country to ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they keep their crops safe and pest-free
without the use of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies has proven solutions for
spider mites, aphids, thrips, russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, broad mites, shoreflies,
whitefly, and others too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rely on Natural Enemies for
expertise and excellent service.

week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Colm Reilly, co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Malibu Compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we learned soup to
nuts about how compost is made,
[SPEAKER_00]: why it's regenerative, and how to scale it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the important things that you
continually point out, Colm, is the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: local microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, you know, is in contrast to the
idea that that compost can be made
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere on the other side of the country
and then it gets shipped to you on pallets
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you use it locally, expecting it
to keep your cannabis plants alive when
[SPEAKER_00]: the food is actually from somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it really kind of blew my
mind when you were talking in San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco at Indo Expo about these
microbioregions and the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating local microbes in cannabis
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you go through that line of thought
for us a little bit right now in the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference, I guess I mean the diversity
of local microbes and why we want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that we capture and use those local
microbes in our soil for growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess just to say I suddenly got hit
over the head with the bat of eco guilt
[SPEAKER_01]: because our compost does ship to other
places and people do use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why I'm flying out at about
midnight tonight back to Pennsylvania to
[SPEAKER_01]: get to work again on our first wind rose
that we're making in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exciting as it is to ship compost to
Pennsylvania, I think it's much more
[SPEAKER_01]: important to make the compost in
Pennsylvania and then have it available
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly sometimes, you know,
something can still work and things work
[SPEAKER_01]: on a nutritional and a biological level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's this question of local
and I guess one way to explain it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: if you think of microbes as almost
livestock of the soil, think of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: same kind of biodiversity that we have
above ground in our forests and our plains
[SPEAKER_01]: and our wooded areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of the same just massive
biodiversity of microbes underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have different types
and different herds of microbes in
[SPEAKER_01]: different areas of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's just different soil types and
different characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those have an important role to play
in those regions and have a historical
[SPEAKER_01]: role.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the dairy cow, it's we're we're
kind of cherry picking because the dairy
[SPEAKER_01]: cow is foraging on pasture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those pastures have different
characteristics in different parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would certainly say we've seen
significant differences between the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost that we make in California and the
compost that we make in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to put myself down, but I feel
that there is sort of an inherent,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily want to use the word
superiority, but there seems to be a much
[SPEAKER_01]: higher level of energy and diversity in
the Oregon compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that has a lot to do with
the fact that because of rainfall and
[SPEAKER_01]: weather and some other meteorological
phenomenon, the cows are able to be
[SPEAKER_01]: outside and have many, many more days on
pasture than their California
[SPEAKER_01]: counterparts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's certainly one of the things that
you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pasture management is really good
because of the water and the different
[SPEAKER_01]: cycles that you're able to have there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still important to have locally
produced compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you start looking at some of the
microbiome regions, just think that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's many, many different herds of
microbes in different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here on the West Coast, from the
Pacific Northwest to Humboldt and
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino County, right down the
California coastline to the Redwood
[SPEAKER_01]: Forests of Santa Cruz, we have an
ecosystem that's largely derived from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always talk about this when I'm
talking about indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always throw out the question,
does a bear shit in the woods?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing to remember is there used to
be a whole lot more bears in these woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did the bears used to eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Salmon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what would the bears do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit in the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have this fertility that's almost
sort of ocean-derived, spreading itself
[SPEAKER_01]: out in that nutrient footprint,
whether it's from the birds or the bears
[SPEAKER_01]: or all these other animals, and filling
all of our mountain ranges along the
coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the coastal lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rains come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of sort of the local
nutritional footprints, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: of this type of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're talking to growers,
and it doesn't matter what you're growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a significant consideration in my
mind when you start thinking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: how am I going to add additional fertility
to your plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And contrary to what the chemical
companies will have, you believe not all
[SPEAKER_01]: NPK is created equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're putting blood meal on your
plants, or bone meal on your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might be getting bone meal from a hog
processing facility in Arkansas run by
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnsonville that you would never want to
take anything from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're putting on that plants when you
have available to you shrimp meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And crab meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fish meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all sorts of crustacean-derived that
have a much more sort of localized
[SPEAKER_01]: footprint for what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you find it all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with the weeds and the plant
matter that's growing in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with the forest duff,
as you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a fascinating area where
science is struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying to catch up and almost
literally invent and define this field of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil microbiology as fast as they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of those exciting things
where the science of the soil is probably
[SPEAKER_01]: just as misunderstood or has yet to be
understood as, from a geography
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint, the depths of our oceans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that area that we've never
really hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everything else we've been able to
define.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this kind of vast unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know that there's just these
different aspects of different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing you find, which is
interesting, where science is still kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of trying to explain it, is where
indigenous wisdom comes into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And biodynamics sometimes, some of the
purists like to think, OK, biodynamics was
[SPEAKER_01]: coined by Rudolf Steiner in 1924.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the end all be all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not quite that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Steiner was much more also a cultural
scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looked at what different cultures
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you start looking at some of the
agricultural practices of the Mayans or
[SPEAKER_01]: the Aztecs or different Native American
tribes, you see that there's relationships
[SPEAKER_01]: in their agricultural practices that have
to do with the cycles of the moon,
[SPEAKER_01]: that have to do with the cycles of the
year, that have to do with the cycles of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and animals and how they plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are different practices that
they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they might not even really be
able to tell you everything behind it
[SPEAKER_01]: other than it was just passed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more recently, I saw you at a
phenomenal podcast talking about Korean
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was with Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm sure I wasn't able to catch
every segment of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that Korean natural
farming looks at is harnessing the power
[SPEAKER_01]: of these indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something as simple as taking a plate
of steamed rice that are in a box and
[SPEAKER_01]: taking it and putting it underneath a tree
on your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you mentioned, that humus,
that forest duff, when we say compost
[SPEAKER_01]: happens, all you need to do is go stand
underneath the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And microscopically, every hour,
every second, compost is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microorganisms that you can't even see are
slowly falling to the ground and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: broken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And compost is happening on that forest
floor every second of every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so putting steamed rice out in the
forest underneath the tree is all those
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of local microorganisms are
landing on that rice and sticking to that
[SPEAKER_01]: rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that rice is then used as a catalyst
combined with plant matter harvested from
[SPEAKER_01]: that property filled with water and
utilizing a catalyst such as a
[SPEAKER_01]: lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does, it starts that
fermentation and reproduction process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those indigenous microorganisms now
are reproducing over and over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: again and replicating themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're now building populations of
microorganisms that are uniquely specific
[SPEAKER_01]: to your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not that you're going after those
indigenous microorganisms for NPK
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, but you're really going after
that health, that vitality, and that
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the stronger the plant is as far as
its ability to not have to worry and have
[SPEAKER_01]: a care in the world for pests and
diseases, disease and other aspects,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can just do what it does, is have this
symbiotic relationship with all the life
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having that healthy soil and having
this healthy approach to the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going to create this nutrient
density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can look at a soil test and you
can look at a multivitamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the label on your kid's
multivitamins and look at all the
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that you find in your soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to see the same compounds
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see all these different
minerals that we look at in terms of human
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to understand that that's
what's transmuting into the food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the secondary metabolites is
really what we're looking at that can
[SPEAKER_01]: build not only just the human health and
the plant health, but its health just
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond the nutrients that our bodies
crave.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this added health and vitality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the ability to resist pests and
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see it in children that played in the
mud or grew up on a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just naturally are healthier and more
resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to look far outside away
from our journals of science and our
[SPEAKER_01]: journals of nature and our journals of
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is we basically have a
medical field in this country that knows
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing about nutrition and health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a whole disconnect here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diabetes rate in this country used to
be one for every 50,000 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's one out of every 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something's severely wrong with our
soil, with our plants, and with our food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we take this back to cannabis,
it's understanding that cannabis does have
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, sometimes it almost blows your
mind for people that can swear up and down
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis has medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet are completely ignorant of the fact
that the medicinal properties and value of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has everything to do with how
it's grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to stick a cannabis plant
in a bunch of rock wool and dump a bottle,
[SPEAKER_01]: just bottle after bottle of bottle after
nutrients, synthetic nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then say, oh, but the cannabis is
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's like saying a steering
wheel has the ability to drive you down
[SPEAKER_01]: the freeway from Seattle to Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the car that's attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to ignore that aspect of it is kind of
doing the same disservice that all of us
[SPEAKER_01]: are trying to overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really be a part of the solution of
what's wrong with our food system and our
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural system and not be part of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really takes the whole idea of whole
plant medical cannabis to a whole other
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you talking about all the
cannabinoid constituents, but also the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire life and micronutrients of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that always cure,
I mean, not always, I've only really been
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about this for about a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things I've been curious
about for the last year is that with these
[SPEAKER_00]: local microbes, does it make sense to only
use your local microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that since everywhere in the
United States, pretty much plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, that you should have a complete
set of the necessary microbes where you
[SPEAKER_00]: live and not necessarily have to bring
them from somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, perhaps you want to ship yourself
a higher quality compost, that's one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I first started thinking about
microbes, I was thinking, oh, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I were to order a compost, say from
Oklahoma, where it's certainly more dry
[SPEAKER_00]: and the soil has a different composition
than where I live in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I order a bag there and I bring it
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the microbes that would come with it,
they're used to a drier environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not used to these tepid winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're built for a different environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking, you know, they very well
might not do well in my soil here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what if there's something that's
missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, probably where I live in the
Pacific Northwest, I probably have got a
[SPEAKER_00]: full set of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can imagine that there might be
parts of the country where the soil is so
[SPEAKER_00]: stripped that they really do need to
import microbes from somewhere else
[SPEAKER_00]: because their own soil is lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any truth or possibility to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this might be an area where people
that are far more knowledgeable on
[SPEAKER_01]: specific microbial inoculations than I
could speak better to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll throw out a couple examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a very close family friend and
agricultural friend that we work together
[SPEAKER_01]: as a biodynamic vineyard consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's worked all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: He honed his craft in France and he's been
all over top vineyards on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's utilized some microbial inoculants on
some vineyards down in the central coast
[SPEAKER_01]: of California, sort of down Santa Ynez
type area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that he told me was
adding a microbial inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What he noticed and, you know,
it's not as scientifically rigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please don't question my numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said something like it looked like
something like after taking samples,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like 60% of the microbes that
had been added died off that they just
[SPEAKER_01]: they weren't they couldn't thrive in that
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they also noticed was it had a
detrimental effect on a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when something gets introduced,
it can outcompete your you're creating
[SPEAKER_01]: something completely out of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just saw the headline yesterday that
what they said, like 30,000 factory farmed
[SPEAKER_01]: salmon escaped from their free pens up in
Newfoundland and now are like swimming
[SPEAKER_01]: around the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't notice this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't tell anybody that there was a
hole in the net.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it only happened when local fishermen
started catching these salmon that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were like, these aren't our normal salmon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they create these factory farmed
salmon and they stick these pens out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're highly you know, all the fish
are combined in one small area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're much more prone to picking up
certain diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they escape through the net.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now all of a sudden, they're out
roaming about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can outcompete they can create
they can just create all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: imbalances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back to the soil, you can have
different microbial inoculations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's the question of are they going
to survive and thrive in a new climate?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the effect and impact that
they're going to have on the local
[SPEAKER_01]: indigenous microorganism population?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things you're after is a lot
of diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no there's no one silver
bullet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't tell somebody in
Pennsylvania or Maine or Oklahoma or
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere else to just buy a bag of Malibu.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in Oregon and in California,
we're telling our much larger customers,
[SPEAKER_01]: people that want several truckloads of
compost for their for their vineyard or
[SPEAKER_01]: for their orchard or for their cannabis
grow, is if you're getting a larger amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of compost and we can work with you,
bring me some of your own on site compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring me some of your topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's bury that in the compost pile while
it's cooking, while it's simmering,
[SPEAKER_01]: while it's going through this heated
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can introduce those microbes
right from your property into the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have them sort of work out their
issues and figure out a way to get along
[SPEAKER_01]: and reproduce before they even,
you know, so that way they can kind of hit
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground running for for lack of a
better way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so next.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so next level compost column.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, the idea that you would
have this thought out to such a degree
[SPEAKER_00]: that that you're going to actually
inoculate your, you know, custom off the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf compost with their inoculant from
the locality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it it's actually exciting to
know that somebody is even bothering to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that, because I think so many of the
growers who are listening, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what that's that's what's in their
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that you are able to do it at
a commercial level, it's invigorating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where I really would say, you know,
the proof is in the poop is this is where
[SPEAKER_01]: compost teas become so exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a way that somebody can
capture some of that diversity and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: all these amazing benefits that we're
talking about between the cow and the
[SPEAKER_01]: digestive system and the microbial
diversity and then still get it out onto
[SPEAKER_01]: their property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a gentleman, Alex
Podolinsky, who's in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can now read about the Podolinsky
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Alex Podolinsky followed by dynamics
and Australia was just getting devastated
[SPEAKER_01]: by this growth of commercial synthetic
agriculture and fields were getting more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more degraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he followed by dynamics and he saw
this and the cow and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he realized we don't have cows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get some kangaroo poop running around
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like there's not the same massive
amount of herds of cows in Australia that
[SPEAKER_01]: there are in in, you know, the United
States and Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what he did then was realize as we
needed to make sort of a compost catalyst
[SPEAKER_01]: from the cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the preparation that you see
that there's stuffed in the cow horns
[SPEAKER_01]: that's buried underground and that's
allowed to turn into this rich sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: humus material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is literally taking a teaspoon of
that and stirring it into water and
[SPEAKER_01]: diluting it to the point where it's
treating one acre of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can have a pound of
compost that's being treated that's
[SPEAKER_01]: treating 50 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about something on the
most minute and homeopathic level and as
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody believed this guy until
Australian public television aired a
[SPEAKER_01]: special with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a bunch of people thought he was
into witchcraft and thousands of farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: started driving overnight to his farm to
come visit and figure out how could we do
[SPEAKER_01]: this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there the proof you can see and
somebody will do a compost tea application
[SPEAKER_01]: that's only the most minute introduction
in small doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're looking at creating that impulse
and just that small little impulse that
[SPEAKER_01]: then is going to replicate itself and then
replicate itself another time and
[SPEAKER_01]: replicated another time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're building up this health and
vitality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a one size fits all massive
approach, but you're going over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter where you are, in
biodynamics, I always say you always want
[SPEAKER_01]: to add your own topsoil or clay or
something into your compost during that
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while it's undergoing this
transformation, you have that spectral
[SPEAKER_01]: profile, if you will, of your soil and
your indigenous microorganisms added into
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're purchasing Malibu compost or any
other soil for that matter, you should be
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to maybe you don't have much of
your own compost, but anything that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can have on site, maybe even you make a
tea out of what you have and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying that onto the compost that you
can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But regardless, one should join forces
with the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the earlier in that sort of process
that that can take place, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can add something into your compost
pile or into my compost pile of yours
[SPEAKER_01]: while it's simmering and cooking,
you're allowing a lot of those issues that
[SPEAKER_01]: suddenly can result from a shock type
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think about transplant shock,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're mitigating that by creating
something that can kind of work out their
[SPEAKER_01]: issues and then get to this point of
harmony and synergy before you're
[SPEAKER_01]: introducing plants as living organisms
into a chaotic environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather, it's an environment that's just
thriving and ready to do its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's go ahead and take our second
short break.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Colm Riley.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's co-founder of Malibu Compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've got everybody all
excited about compost, wanting to make
[SPEAKER_00]: their own, wanting to, you know,
wild harvest, local microbes, let's talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about the applications for compost,
both, you know, some typical stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to see in horticulture,
but also some of the new kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: groundbreaking applications that we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we start at the top Colm and
hit each of these for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us a little bit about compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, compost tea is incredibly exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure you've had plenty of podcasts
and guests who were experts in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly wouldn't claim to be one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's, you know, I would guess I
would point out there's a distinction
[SPEAKER_01]: between a compost tea, which is considered
something that's actively aerated versus a
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea or compost extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, you know, a lot of debate on
different sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, you know, a lot of people that
are fiercely into the actively aerated
[SPEAKER_01]: compost teas on the Elaine Ingham side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, you know, heard and read some stuff
that Scott is working on at where he's
[SPEAKER_01]: looking a lot more towards extracts and
what that does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fundamental idea is, well,
back it up even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talk about compost tea,
we put together a very, very rudimentary
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of, I call it the gateway drug to
compost tea is our little Malibu compost
[SPEAKER_01]: tea bags are available on Amazon and most
of your local stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a quarter pound of compost and a
little cotton baggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all dried out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you soak it in five gallons of water
and you put it on your plants the next
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did not use the word aerate there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't use it because technically if
you soak it and squeeze it out and put it
[SPEAKER_01]: on your plants the next day, it's
considered a cold water compost tea
[SPEAKER_01]: extract by the compost tea definitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could put an air stone in it and
you can put your bubbler in it and you
[SPEAKER_01]: could brew a compost tea where all these
microorganisms are reproducing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, millions and millions of times
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's different aspects of compost
teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different recipes for compost teas
and the things that you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also find really exciting how you
can use compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it's an extract or actively
aerated compost teas, most people look at
[SPEAKER_01]: brewing a compost tea, but then watering
it into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great because you're getting
the nutrients, the minerals, the trace
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really what we're looking at is all
that beneficial bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want the beneficial guys to
out-compete the harmful guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most common applications of
compost teas that you'll read and hear
[SPEAKER_01]: about is adding it as a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're spraying it on the underside
of the leaves where the plant stomata is,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's able to take it up through the
stomata right into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I think of that, it's like a
quick fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of like a quick, it has to go
right into the plant's immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those beneficials are able to go
right through the stomata into the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system as opposed to having to go
through the soil, compete in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: make their way up through the root system
and out to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're spraying it right onto the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be careful that it has smaller
particles because the smaller the
[SPEAKER_01]: particles, the greater the surface area,
the easier the plant can absorb it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want to use some of these
battery powered super atomizers because
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes the force with which you spray
it can kill the very microbes that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: spent all this time to breed and to
diversify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really exciting when you see
tree surgeons and tree care people that
[SPEAKER_01]: will have these like 10 foot long
syringes, if you will, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: injecting compost tea down into the root
system of trees as a way to balance out
[SPEAKER_01]: and add more benefits to the overall,
it's sort of just like a quick fix of
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to treat the teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things I always tell people
is, I'm typically not a huge fan,
[SPEAKER_01]: and again, I'm not an expert so somebody
can correct me, but I'm not a huge fan of
[SPEAKER_01]: brewing further than 24 hours because I
just feel inherently like once you get to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point where you have to start
introducing bacterial foods and fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: foods and microbial foods, once you get to
that point, you're almost introducing a
[SPEAKER_01]: level of competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different microbes may or may not have
preference for different types of food
[SPEAKER_01]: sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you've blended all your
ingredients and you've created all this
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity by simply adding molasses,
for example, you seem to almost now be
[SPEAKER_01]: source selecting which microbes are going
to do better and which microbes are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do worse and are going to thrive in
different competitive environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll leave that to other people in
terms of overall teas and approaches,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just the sheer results that people see
with teas are, I mean, that's the proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we sell an expensive compost that
people can add to build your soil biology
[SPEAKER_01]: and people use it and they carefully pay
attention and then they tell us how great
[SPEAKER_01]: it is, but it takes a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beauty of compost tea is people
will put it on their plants and they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: call you immediately and they see the
color green change and they see the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: turn towards the sky and start praying
upwards and they see and they feel these
[SPEAKER_01]: physical tangible results and that's what
gets them excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's so much more you can do in
terms of building your recipes with teas
[SPEAKER_01]: and how you use the teas and how you're
just adding this thing where something's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using a principle of frequency as
opposed to quantity and it's creating
[SPEAKER_01]: these small little impulses, but just
giving nature the tools that it needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: nudge it in that right direction and just
keep that health and vitality in your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that frequency versus quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's also talk briefly about soil
amendments because pretty much all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy probiotic stuff that you just said
about compost tea will also cross apply to
[SPEAKER_00]: just simply taking some compost and mixing
it in with your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But often I hear from people, you don't
want to just use compost because it may
[SPEAKER_00]: even somehow be too potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're recommending compost as a
soil amendment, how much do you recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: people go with?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using a well-balanced compost,
typically you could go anywhere up to 25%
[SPEAKER_01]: of your soil, maybe as high as 30% of your
soil mix, but you're going to need
[SPEAKER_01]: aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want some local,
more of a top soil type of blend for
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are in containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we see people use like a third
perlite, a third peat, a third malibu and
[SPEAKER_01]: call it a day with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But compost also has a higher bulk
density, means it has less free airspace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want something and as you add
more water, it's going to gradually get
[SPEAKER_01]: eaten up, taken down by the plants and
create more compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want to have too much compost
in your mix without having the proper
[SPEAKER_01]: aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really it kind of depends on what type
of, if you're getting something that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: and sometimes often it's things that
aren't even compost because they've
[SPEAKER_01]: changed the definition now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things that used to be called composted
steer manure or composted chicken manure,
[SPEAKER_01]: they use the word composted as a
substitute for aged.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means it was just put in a pile and it
just kind of got old and now they're
[SPEAKER_01]: calling it composted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with things like that, you can get a
lot of different pockets, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different hot areas, it can burn plants,
it can lock out nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have some different negative
effects by using compost, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: using too much compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically I'd say anywhere from that
10 to 25% range with what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind that everything's all
about balance and whether you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at the work of Dr. Elaine Ingham and she's
talking about balance between bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: and fungal or you're looking at the work
of Albrecht where you're looking at these
[SPEAKER_01]: different ratios of minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have that balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many, many people could look at me with an
absolute blank stare in the eye if I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever asked them if they've used a bricks
meter on their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: No concept of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No concept of the overall compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the turps, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's understanding that you want to
build this diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to build this balance in
these ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, I guess it's imperative to
really understand what you're working
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the quick answer would be, well,
it depends on what kind of compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: but general parameter, 10 to 30% of your
soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that you gave enough extra
information that people can kind of think
[SPEAKER_00]: through the challenge on their own based
on the variables you gave them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways that I use compost is as a
top dress and that kind of hits on your
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency over a quantity because I'll put
the compost on top and then every time I
[SPEAKER_00]: water it, some of the goods go down into
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a pretty common way to
use it, especially when people are having
[SPEAKER_00]: a not good experience with either growing
their cannabis or their vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going in for the save and they're
adding some compost on the top and
[SPEAKER_00]: watering it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question for you is when using it as a
top dress, do I need to put down the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and then put some more soil on
top?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I suspect that if we use compost
and it is interacting with the air that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to dry out and all my
beneficials are going to get choked out
[SPEAKER_00]: just from the dryness.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is typically I tell people when
they're applying it as a top dress,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just want to kind of lightly scratch
it into the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: That also helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes composts have this sort of
initial hydrophobic aspect and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: things to just absorb evenly and get that
flow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's also where it's important to
not have bare soil on the top and
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing just something as a mulch cover
at the top, whether you're using grasses
[SPEAKER_01]: or planting cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Planting cover crops, whether you're in
the ground or even indoors in a container,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can plant cover crops around the base
of your cannabis and that adds shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: It protects the soil from being bare which
allows all these microbiology in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: to come and literally feed off the top
layer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are one of the things you see
exciting in probiotic gardening such as
[SPEAKER_01]: working with the earth box where you're
growing in a small limited area and your
[SPEAKER_01]: roots can't go down further.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just can't go into the ground ad
infinitum and just keep going and going
[SPEAKER_01]: and searching for good food.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing outdoors, you need to
have a soil bank approach, a three to five
[SPEAKER_01]: year strategic approach for building your
soil because if you're not, you're an
[SPEAKER_01]: idiot in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're just going to outsource
money that you could be building each
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in containers, you've got to
realize things just don't drop out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: sky and your root system can't go anywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an opportunity to create that top
dress as a nutritional layer and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're feeding the soil,
not the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're adding the compost, you're
protecting the top so people can come up
[SPEAKER_01]: and eat off the top surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where adding amendments like a
bokashi or just other forms of nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and foods that can be applied at the top
surface as a top dress but then just be
[SPEAKER_01]: gently covered up so then they can be
taken not just through watering but the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology in the soil will come to the
surface and literally eat it and excrete
[SPEAKER_01]: it and move it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see indoor warehouses now where
everything's grown under lights but
[SPEAKER_01]: they're growing in soil and these guys
have cover crops growing around the base
[SPEAKER_01]: of their cannabis plant and they'll pull
back the hay or straw that they're using
[SPEAKER_01]: as a mulch layer and you'll see worms
crawling around in a 55 gallon pot and
[SPEAKER_01]: just creating this whole sort of symbiotic
food web right there even if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: limited to an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so awesome and especially when it
replaces the dead zone at the top of a pot
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you just simply even cover it with
some sort of organic straw or something
[SPEAKER_00]: and it increases the size of the or rather
the percentage of the amount of soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant can actually readily use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that a pot you're gonna lose
a certain amount of the usable soil if the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil at top is just facing the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might as well put in a cover crop
not only does it look very visually
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfying but it's super great for the
plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're almost out of time but there are
two more things I want to hit with you
[SPEAKER_00]: Colm.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is it's not necessarily growing based
but you've talked about these these
[SPEAKER_00]: compost socks that they're using at
construction sites and I think that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting idea so would you just hit on
that briefly just because so people can go
[SPEAKER_00]: oh that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I mean it's I was fascinated to learn
several years ago that the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: purchaser of compost in the state of
California you know is not almonds or not
[SPEAKER_01]: hazelnuts or not grapes or anything else
or cannabis it's Caltrans and it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: State Department of Transportation using
it for erosion control on highway projects
[SPEAKER_01]: and what they've realized is it's just
it's that ability to create to build the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil back up as a sponge to add life to
the soil to help prevent water from
[SPEAKER_01]: running off that's the problem with
California we never have enough water
[SPEAKER_01]: until it rains and then we have too much
water and it all runs out to the ocean
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not capturing it we're not creating
that filtration we're not building the
[SPEAKER_01]: subsoil and so the erosion controls that
you know just works great and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: spray indigenous or native wildflowers on
it and boom they they grab the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately and it takes the place of a
lot of these other things but you'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: it on construction sites anywhere where
there's runoff creek streams berms
[SPEAKER_01]: embankments your backyard might have a
steep slope coming from a neighbor and the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost socks are similar to those socks
that you see the straw waddles in but
[SPEAKER_01]: think about almost sort of a fabric pot
material and a large sock and fill the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire thing with compost and you lay it
down and now it acts like a biofiltration
[SPEAKER_01]: so as the water from the erosion is
running down the hill it's having to pass
[SPEAKER_01]: through this compost berm and that compost
is pulling out a lot of the heavy metals
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of the pollutants and a lot of
the harmful excess nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_01]: running into the creeks and creating these
algal blooms and everything else and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: capturing that in the compost and it's
also flushed to the ground much different
[SPEAKER_01]: than those concrete K rails that you see
that it looks like all the silt just goes
[SPEAKER_01]: right around you can use compost berms in
conjunction with specific types of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: for bioremediation which you see them
using in sites where petroleum based
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff or other harmful things that you'll
see which cause you know just severe
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation and this is something that
should be looked at even more in areas of
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy intense conventional farming and if
you look what's happening to the Gulf of
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico and everything else that's going
downstream from that you know I went to
[SPEAKER_01]: register our product in Michigan and the
biggest their issue there is phosphates
[SPEAKER_01]: and now people have been ignoring it and
you've had farmers for years that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been calculating how much fertilizer to
add to their land based on how much
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen they need to grow per acre of
corn but they're only looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen they're not looking at the P or
the K or the excess load and I don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: know what the the statistics would be for
a state or for this country or for the
[SPEAKER_01]: world but when you look at like just the
fact that we're in a shortage of nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: how many excess nutrients just get flushed
into our river and waterways and just are
[SPEAKER_01]: choking our aquatic life which we depend
on which once again you know contributes
[SPEAKER_01]: to global warming you know if there is
such a thing well this actually bleeds
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly into the last question I had for
you so like you know we've got it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: with the last three or four minutes I
heard your presentation last weekend and
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed it on on the organic revolution
and and you know you in your role at
[SPEAKER_00]: Malibu compost I see you both as as a
researcher and product developer you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out these these
techniques for creating this most
[SPEAKER_00]: biodynamic compost that you can but then
also you're also an evangelist right
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're one part salesperson you
know encouraging vineyards and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: people to use your compost but also you're
doing things like like right here on my
[SPEAKER_00]: show just pretty much talking about
compost for the people and for nature
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway so regardless of your own brand you
know just use compost people make it buy
[SPEAKER_00]: it whatever you got to do use it and so
you have got a unique seat for this this
[SPEAKER_00]: this revival of probiotic growing kind of
post synthetic inputs and so my question
[SPEAKER_00]: to you is is what are you seeing you know
are you are you seeing that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing the message and are making in the
transition or are you seeing that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: falling on deaf ears I am seeing just an
absolute I'm seeing a world in flux and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing problems become greater and
greater and more dire and human beings
[SPEAKER_01]: having less and less compassion and
communication and on the same side I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing community come back together that
we haven't seen in years and the
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative agriculture movement is so
exciting and inspiring because a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people just want a better way there must
be a better way just please show me and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening in this movement and
thank you for what you do because your
[SPEAKER_01]: help spreading the word of saying these
are tangible steps that you can take and
[SPEAKER_01]: they work there's a better way and
sometimes it might even seem a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive up front but you have to just
look at where it is six months down the
[SPEAKER_01]: road one year down the road two years down
the road you know I've talked to people
[SPEAKER_01]: who've bought truckloads of my compost and
put it in their pots and they haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: bought any the next year because they've
talked about the residual impacts on their
[SPEAKER_01]: soil of what's happened after one
application of really boosting that soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and creating you know if they're growing
in ground or in trenches of what they see
[SPEAKER_01]: happen the secondary year and developing a
system so they don't have to use as much
[SPEAKER_01]: and everywhere you look more and more
research is coming out that's showing
[SPEAKER_01]: people a better way to do it we're
realizing and it's one of those things you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the difference between organic and
biodynamic versus conventional and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of things like this it's not the
differences aren't as you know
[SPEAKER_01]: hyperdefined until things have problems
and then it becomes more and more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: clear I you know if I want to do a
side-by-side trial on a lawn with and
[SPEAKER_01]: without compost I'm gonna find a really
crappy lawn no pun intended to put my
[SPEAKER_01]: compost on because the you know it's just
gonna be that much more dramatic but we
[SPEAKER_01]: live in dramatic times you know we live in
dramatic times where people have more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more cancers and more and more mental
illnesses and Rudolf Steiner talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: this back in 1924 he said if people
continue to eat food that's devoid of life
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil the greatest problems plaguing
mankind are being going to be cancers and
[SPEAKER_01]: mental illnesses because you have to think
about our body and our brain as a highly
[SPEAKER_01]: developed digestive tract and we're a
reflection of the nutrients nutrition that
[SPEAKER_01]: we receive you know no matter what form it
comes to us and so people are coming into
[SPEAKER_01]: this with challenges people are getting
into growing cannabis because somebody got
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer you know people are getting into
this for all sorts of different reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're coming together and realizing
this and with these new platforms of
[SPEAKER_01]: communication whether it's your podcast
whether it's Instagram people doing things
[SPEAKER_01]: in the right way in the ethical way around
the world are now sharing information and
[SPEAKER_01]: saying look at what I've done look at what
I've done look what I did taking what this
[SPEAKER_01]: person has done and built off of it and
creating this synergy of knowledge and of
[SPEAKER_01]: information and of tangible practices that
we can do in our own gardens in our own
[SPEAKER_01]: communities you know and in our own
countries is having a massive residual
[SPEAKER_01]: effect and people that are doing it are
seeing the results they're healing their
[SPEAKER_01]: cancers they're healing their diabetes
they're you know they're they're living
[SPEAKER_01]: you know they're told they got six months
to live and 12 years later they're giving
[SPEAKER_01]: classes on nutrition and soil health you
know this is the world that we live in so
[SPEAKER_01]: the inspirations all around us you know
again thank you for what you do because
[SPEAKER_01]: the knowledge is there and it is a battle
it's a battle a lot of this work has just
[SPEAKER_01]: been snuffed out by the power of these big
chemical companies by the power of these
[SPEAKER_01]: big agricultural universities land-grant
universities because anytime there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something for someone to gain somebody
else has something to lose and when you
[SPEAKER_01]: follow the money and you see what other
people have to lose and you say oh that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't sound possible what's not possible
because somebody spent millions and
[SPEAKER_01]: millions and millions of dollars to
convince farmers you're right it isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: possible because they stand to lose
everything they have absolutely well hot
[SPEAKER_00]: damn call like that was that that's
fantastic fantastic I feel very
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiastic and and actually really
really pleased with how this show turned
[SPEAKER_00]: out this information is came together on a
really nice package and and most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly to me not only does it give
the compost basics but we we really went
[SPEAKER_00]: deep into it into like third and fourth
levels of analysis so thank you so much
[SPEAKER_00]: for for not only sharing your time because
I know your time is very valuable but
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for sharing your experience both
with the compost but with your ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain it in a way that we can all grok
it without science degrees so thank you so
[SPEAKER_01]: much brother oh absolutely such a pleasure
to talk with you and thank you again for
[SPEAKER_01]: you know spreading the word on so many
important topics to so many people awesome
