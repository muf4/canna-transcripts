[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is fair to say that most people
who enjoy cannabis do so because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: THC in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, I know plenty of people who are
focused on the other cannabinoids for
[SPEAKER_01]: either health or commerce reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plenty of people obtain their relief
through CBD or CBG or CBN or the other
[SPEAKER_01]: novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next generation products like
beverages infused with these cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: have become a huge hit in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But many of these companies are held back
because those other cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_01]: associated too directly with the wrongly
persecuted THC molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp has been one way to try and take a
half step away from full THC plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to gain access to the other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now many states, including California,
have made cannabinoids from hemp even
[SPEAKER_01]: disallowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I used to love Creek River
botanical hops and cannabinoid beverages,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can't find their products anywhere
now due to the change in California law
[SPEAKER_01]: interpretation.
[SPEAKER_01]: While it was foolish from the beginning to
prohibit the cannabis plant at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibiting access to the non THC
cannabinoids is even worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like dumb stacked upon ignorance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure would be great if we could get
cannabinoids from a secondary plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have THC in it at all,
wouldn't it?

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to episode 121.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Dr. Paula Berman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Berman earned her bachelor's in
biotechnology engineering and her master's
[SPEAKER_01]: and PhD in environmental engineering from
Ben-Gurion University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout her studies, she worked in the
plant lipid biotechnology lab under
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor Zaya Wiesman, focusing on the
chemistry of vegetable oils and their
[SPEAKER_01]: applications in biodiesel production.
[SPEAKER_01]: She completed her first post-doctoral
fellowship in the cancer biology and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid research lab at the Technion's
Faculty of Biology led by Professor Diddy
[SPEAKER_01]: Mary.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the lab's lead analytical chemist,
she developed mass spectrometry methods to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify over a hundred cannabinoids in
cannabis, as well as endocannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: related compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paula then joined the lab of Professor
Esaf Aharoni at the Plant Science
[SPEAKER_01]: Department at the Weizmann Institute,
where she completed a second post-doc and
[SPEAKER_01]: now serves as a research associate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her research focuses on the biosynthetic
pathways of cannabinoids and psychedelics
[SPEAKER_01]: with therapeutic potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: This coming summer, Paula will establish
her own research lab at the Volcani
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural Center, where she will
continue investigating medicinal plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and their specialized metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is truly impressive work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to learn about the
woolly umbrella plant, better known in the
[SPEAKER_01]: lab as the heli.
[SPEAKER_01]: We conducted today's interview halfway
around the world from each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: so there are a few echoes and minor drops
today, but nothing annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the first set, we will discuss the
botanical attributes, distribution,
[SPEAKER_01]: and uses for the heli plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the second set, we dig into the various
cannabinoids, extraction methods,
[SPEAKER_01]: and applications, and we finish the
episode with a short discussion about the
[SPEAKER_01]: future of this amazing plant, both
commercially and scientifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Dr. Berman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for taking time,
especially since we are so far separated
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world today, to be up late talking
to me and early here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you making a special time for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for this invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start off with the simple basics
with the woolly umbrella plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a complex, to me, scientific name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to say it a bunch of times in
preparation for our interview today,
[SPEAKER_01]: and each time I said it different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of me embarrassing myself,
let us please start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say the scientific name for us
so that we can all learn it together?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the name is Helichrysum
umbrachylederum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a mouthful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also tough for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So woolly umbrella is the common name that
I have most come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that your preferred common name?
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually in the lab, we call the plant
Heli as a nickname.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heli from its proper Latin name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll probably go back and forth between
Heli and woolly just so I can feel
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with the distribution of
the Heli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is the Heli plant found and what are
its basic characteristics?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the origin is in South Africa and the
eastern part of South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perennial herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows all year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flowers around January to April.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ornamental plant in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has silver hairy leaves and with
beautiful bright yellow flowers that look
[SPEAKER_00]: like umbrellas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the name of the plant
comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that it's used for ornamental
purposes primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have a reputation as a medicinal
plant at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was this a surprise to find medicinal
properties in this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of Helichrysum plants from South
Africa have medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known to be burnt in rituals,
in cleansing rituals to connect to
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestors, to provide spiritual guidance
and induce trances.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Zulu tribes use a lot of Helichrysum
species as part of their traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be honest, we couldn't find exact
proof whether this specific Helichrysum
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, Heli plant, has medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know now about many of the
molecules that the plant biosynthesizes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the molecules that the plant accumulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we cannot say for sure what are the
exact medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a study, for example,
that found that extracts from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Helichrysum plant have a GABA receptor
binding effect, which possibly have an
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiolytic effect, anti-epileptic or can
be used for insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are also a lot of other
molecules that have many different
[SPEAKER_00]: bioactivities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the really interesting thing about
this plant is that it's really been
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not been studied and there is very
little information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's fun because that way you get
to explore all the parts of it that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to go just for the pockets
of lacking research.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great to be the first to a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where on the plant do the cannabinoids
appear?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they expressed?
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, the show that worked on
shaping fire, we are mostly focused on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant, but really cannabinoid
medicine in general, which is how I found
[SPEAKER_01]: my way to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in cannabis, the cannabinoids are
grown in the resinous flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are they grown in the Heli plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Heli plant, we found
cannabinoids in all the area parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, besides roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically any type of tissue that
contained glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similar in cannabis, in cannabis you
have, so in fluorescence of cannabis are
[SPEAKER_00]: the most abundant in glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the cannabinoids are
biosynthesized and where they accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similarly, we found it also in the Heli
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are biosynthesized and they
accumulate to these glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are most abundant in leaves,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found them also very abundant in
flowers, but most interesting and the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest potential for us is the fact that
they accumulate the most in leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since they are in trichomes, glandular
trichomes in the Heli plant, just like
[SPEAKER_01]: they are in cannabis, when you rub the
plant with your finger, will you burst
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes and get the smell of the aroma
of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's quite different than in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a very light aroma, very nice
aroma, like a perfume from the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you rub them, you have this
resinous material on your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you spearheaded this comprehensive
study that unveiled the plant's rather
[SPEAKER_01]: unique ability to produce cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really interested in what I guess I'll
call the ignition point of this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, finding cannabinoids in
plants is so atypical, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it wouldn't be the first thing that I
would look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It begs the question, which came first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you go to this plant looking for
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or somehow, did you come across them
accidentally in the lab and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: explored what you found?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which came first when deciding to go into
working with this Heli plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, we were not the first ones
that found that the plant produces
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a German paper from 1979 that
found that the plant produces large
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of CBGA, along with other
molecules, more fruiting types of
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules and some other types.
[SPEAKER_00]: But despite the fact that it was shown
that the plant produces cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant was very largely overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no additional studies looking
into the phytochemistry, no genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: no transcriptome, no biological
information whatsoever on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another study from 2018 led by
Professor Tagliatella Scafatti and
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Giovanni Appendino, which is a
very known expert in natural product
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry, a group from Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were also trying to confirm that
the plant that Heli produces cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and to find what other cannabinoids it
produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to their surprise and to our surprise,
they couldn't find any atypical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only cannabinoids like molecules,
molecules that have a very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical structure like cannabinoids,
but instead of alkyl chains, which we find
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabinoids, they have an aromatic
moiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this other study from 2018,
they also couldn't find any cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started this study,
basically our first question was,
[SPEAKER_00]: does the plant produce cannabinoids or
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't confirmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was our starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what methods did you use to analyze the
plant for cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you do differently that caused
you to find them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that, I mean,
we use the same methods as the other group
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will just talk about them very
briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the difference was that
perhaps they were using a different
[SPEAKER_00]: chemovar in their chemovar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you have in cannabis, high THC,
high CBD, high CBG and so on, types of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemovar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps they were analyzing a chemovar
that doesn't have cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, for us, it was quite
immediate that we identified that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has very large amounts of CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we did it is using LCMS,
HPLC, which is connected to a mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a method, it's an analytical
chemistry method that allows us to take
[SPEAKER_00]: very complex samples and to be able to
identify the specific compounds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: present in our samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the basic method or instrument
that we used for the identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also used some other techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, we used the fact that we
were growing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used a feeding of isotopically
labeled molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are molecules that have isotopic
labeled specific carbons or hydrogens that
[SPEAKER_00]: are labeled in the molecule that are
heavier than the other atoms that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we dip leaves into solutions that
contain these molecules, these labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we basically feed the leaves with the
labeled compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then following several days of
feeding, we can see whether the plant uses
[SPEAKER_00]: these molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They incorporate them in the biosynthesis
using LCMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we can test whether a
specific molecule, a precursor,
[SPEAKER_00]: is taken by the specific enzymes in the
plant to produce the molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids in this instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also used these feeding of
isotopically labeled molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using LCMS, we could identify which of
the molecules were labeled by specific
[SPEAKER_00]: atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also purified specific molecules and
then structure-lucidated them using NMR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use a really cool technique to do
localization of molecules, to find where
[SPEAKER_00]: these molecules are specifically localized
in the tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a method that is called
multi-imaging, mass spectrometry imaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we do mass spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: We acquire a spectrum for each pixel in
our sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can show specifically what is the
location, the localization of specific
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids or any other molecule that is
in the sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a helpful tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine the cheer that went through
the lab on the day that you found
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids in your first attempt.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were these rumors and perhaps CBGA,
and suddenly your lab digs into it and
[SPEAKER_01]: suddenly, boom, there they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that that was a huge
encouragement for everybody on the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you are correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these cannabinoids that we're finding
in the heli plant, are these identical to
[SPEAKER_01]: those found in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming that they are the same
molecule just occurring in a different
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them are similar and others
were different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found around 40, identified around
40 cannabinoids in the heli plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: No THCA, no CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found different types of CBGA
cannabinoids with different alkyl chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found small amounts of CBCA and most of
the other types of cannabinoids were
[SPEAKER_00]: completely new novel cannabinoids that are
not present or have not been identified in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh, how exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm jumping ahead a little bit,
but do we know if those new cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with the human endocannabinoid
system yet or is it too early to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, we haven't tested them
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this is one of the first
things that we would really, really like
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet it's so exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are pretty sure that they also have
other bio activities and that they bind to
[SPEAKER_00]: different receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this paper by Professor Tagliatella
Scaffati and Professor Giovanni Appendino,
[SPEAKER_00]: they tested some of the molecules that
they found in the heli plant for binding
[SPEAKER_00]: affinities to TRP channels and to CB1,
CB2, and some other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even some more fruiting types of
cannabinoids that they found, the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that have the aromatic moiety instead of
the alkyl chain, some of them also show
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are pretty sure that these will be
expanding the repertoire of modulators of
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, they still wait
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I assume that you are able to isolate
these cannabinoids in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: As somebody who studies plant medicine
preparations in the home by citizen
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists, if you will, other than
extracting the cannabinoids from the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in the lab, can this plant be smoked whole
as it is as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are there other chemicals in the plant
that make it unattractive to be smoked in
[SPEAKER_01]: other traditional ways?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned some of the heli plants were
burnt into smudge pots and such
[SPEAKER_01]: traditionally, but I don't know about this
particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly because we've never
tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since there is so little information about
it, I would say that first someone needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to test the toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that there is no mutagenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a paper that looked into the
mutagenicity and there is none for the
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it should be tested for
safety before I can recommend people to
[SPEAKER_00]: start smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you said that, we would never
recommend that anybody smoke it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we definitely don't recommend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I figured if there was any reason that
you were like, oh yeah, like this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: also has got a natural biotoxin in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured I'd want to get that out right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also the plant doesn't have THCase,
so you would probably not have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: effect as in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the CBGA certainly got a lot of
attention because so many people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: States have a hard time finding CBG other
than in isolate, which I recognize isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: is more popular for the pharmaceutical
pursuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But folks look for cannabis that is high
in CBG, at least here in the States for
[SPEAKER_01]: its other medicinal uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the direction I was coming
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the plant have a... How do I want to
say this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there a lot of cannabinoids in each
plant, like the potency, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: of each plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it very high or is the amount of the
volume of cannabinoids in the plant low?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or where compared to, say, cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we measured concentrations,
absolute concentrations of cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found that the leaves that are the most
abundant, as I mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has around 4% of CBGA per dry weight,
which is a lot, much more than you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find in most cannabis chemovers that are
not high CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that now there are these high
CBG strains that for sure have much higher
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, but for CBG is quite a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I was hoping to find
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good new source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for cannabis and cannabinoid
enthusiasts like we here at Shaping Fire,
[SPEAKER_01]: your discovery is very important and
exciting, but I'm curious what the
[SPEAKER_01]: response was from the scientific community
and separately the pharmaceutical product
[SPEAKER_01]: community to your research.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we want to hear that you were
celebrated and you have attracted all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this new research grants and that this
plant has become a celebrity, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not always the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was the response from the science
community and the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: community?
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually the responses were very
enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got very amazing responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the biggest achievements that
we made, the biggest advancements to the
[SPEAKER_00]: field in this study was first of all,
the very comprehensive chemistry that we
[SPEAKER_00]: elucidated, the fact that we provided
another genome and transcriptome of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that produces cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes that we identified that you
can use in etrology systems to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids outside of the plant,
which until this point were only known
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we contributed to new enzymes that
can contribute both to the same types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, but also to produce new
types of cannabinoids that were never been
[SPEAKER_00]: tested or are not known, including new to
nature types of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the fact that we shed light to the
evolution or we suggest about the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution of the biosynthetic pathway of
cannabinoids to have another plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: produces the same types of molecules as
plant science scientists, it was very
[SPEAKER_00]: excited and we got really good responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that and we heard that it opens
new frontiers or avenues for new as new
[SPEAKER_00]: modulators, new molecules that can
modulate the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that it has a whole new type
of entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've mentioned the fact that the plant
produces cannabinoids but besides
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, there are also other types
of merotherpenoids or terpenophenols that
[SPEAKER_00]: are also produced in very high quantities
along with the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have already bioactivities
that are known, other ones that we
[SPEAKER_00]: elucidated which are completely new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that overall this was very
exciting and the response from all around
[SPEAKER_00]: was very exciting, very encouraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that this is a pretty obscure
topic for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that when you go to a cocktail
party or something, this is lost on a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But talking with us, we are your
supporters, we're your fan base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, this feels like a high five
big celebration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much new potential,
healing potential and science potential
[SPEAKER_01]: and an entourage effect potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are lifetimes of research
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all excited with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this plant, does finding this plant
suggest that there might be other plants
[SPEAKER_01]: within the Helly family as an accurate
example?
[SPEAKER_01]: But a genus that might also be providing
cannabinoids or do we feel like we found
[SPEAKER_01]: the one within the genus?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a plant scientist, I think that or I
expect that there are hidden treasures
[SPEAKER_00]: that we haven't elucidated yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that nature is amazing and the
diversity is so large that there are still
[SPEAKER_00]: so many plants that remain unexplored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to also mention that there
are also other plants that produce
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids or cannabinoid-like
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the rhododendron dauricum,
a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a helichrysum genus, it's a
different plant, but it produces the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's also alkyl types
cannabinoids, but they are quite
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are CBCA type cannabinoids,
but also produces them in very large
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also some other cannabinoid-like molecules
that are called amorphroutines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if these have all been identified,
I am pretty sure that we will hear also
[SPEAKER_00]: about some other new plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take a short break and be
right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is plant biochemist Dr. Paula
[SPEAKER_01]: Berman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an
all-natural, OMRI certified fish poop
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate with nothing added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real fish poop is extraordinarily complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only are you adding the nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium your plants need
[SPEAKER_01]: to build mass, transport nutrients,
and enhance flavor, but fish waste is also
[SPEAKER_01]: packed with probiotics and micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add fish poop to your irrigation
water, you are adding fertilizer in a form
[SPEAKER_01]: that strengthens the soil food web in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plants are limited by the absence
of any essential micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_01]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop is a naturally complete solution
that fills in the cracks in your
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer program to ensure that you
offer your garden a broad base of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all fish poop is created equally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most products with added fish waste don't
reveal their sources or lab results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fish poop, however,
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_01]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_01]: koi and tilapia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are even invited to tour their farm in
person or on their YouTube channel to look
[SPEAKER_01]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sort of transparency is wildly rare
in the fertilizer market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks behind fish poop are also
lifelong medical cannabis producers who
[SPEAKER_01]: have deep connections in the community,
donate more product than they sell,
[SPEAKER_01]: and support cannabis prisoners,
veteran, and patient collectives and
[SPEAKER_01]: charities.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get your bottle of pure fish poop,
go to fishpoop.com or search for fish poop
[SPEAKER_01]: on Amazon or walmart.com and to see their
entire line of cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_01]: go to ounceofhope.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fish poop brand fish poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard me talk about the
award-winning cannabis seeds that come
[SPEAKER_01]: from the analytical breeding program of
Seth and Eric Crawford, who founded Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Seth was a guest on Shaping Fire
in 2020 to talk about triploid genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC
seeds for home growers and farms as Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: the Revolution Seeds at gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their high THC seeds are extraordinary in
that they will start to flower at 16 and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half hours of daylight instead of the
typical 14 and a half hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means in most regions, your plants
will start to flower outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of July instead of the middle of
August, which means these photo period
[SPEAKER_01]: plants finish in September and not
October, totally upending the photo period
[SPEAKER_01]: seed market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth and Eric took their prized early
flowering CBG line and bred it to some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most desired verified genetics out
there, including Sour Diesel, Triangle
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush, Wedding Cake, Chem Dogs,
Skittles, and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: These crosses all express powerful photo
period terpene profiles and THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: giving you a great high.
[SPEAKER_01]: GTR Seeds has a new THCV line with plants
like Double Durbin and Gigantor that boast
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 to 1 THC to THCV, and people want that
THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: GTR seeds are very consistent,
true-growing, inbred F1s from stabilized
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred parent lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: These seeds are nearly homogenous and the
plants should all grow the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is only one phenotype in every pack,
available as diploids and triploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth and Eric's company is still
family-owned, patient and
[SPEAKER_01]: employee-centric, and partially powered by
their two acres of solar panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone can purchase these seeds and the
entire catalog of Oregon CBD seeds at
[SPEAKER_01]: gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to gtrseeds.com today and choose
something revolutionary for your next
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor or outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_01]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be fun, sure, but so many
varieties in one pack is a sign of an
[SPEAKER_01]: immature seed line that hasn't been worked
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer my auto flowers to be worked
enough that each pheno in the pack really
[SPEAKER_01]: captures the aspects that the breeder was
intending.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I recommend Gnome Automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_01]: automatic flowering cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gnome automatic seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_01]: recognizable by its traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traits that were hard earned so that you
can have your best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last 10 years, Gnome Automatics
founder Dan Jimmy has become a trusted
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder and he continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_01]: variety he releases for you to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the Gnome Automatics Instagram
at Gnome underscore automatics to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can score Gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_01]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercial cannabis farms across the
country love growing Gnome automatics
[SPEAKER_01]: because of their consistency from seed to
seed, short grow times, THC percentages
[SPEAKER_01]: and colorful bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farms interested in bulk seeds of more
than a thousand should reach out through
[SPEAKER_01]: gnomeautomatics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: While on the website, be sure to check out
the Gnome Automatics shirts and other
[SPEAKER_01]: merch section too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want reliable seeds, hand built
from effort, expert selection and
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, choose Gnome Automatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los and my guest today
[SPEAKER_01]: is plant biochemist, Dr. Paula Berman.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Berman, in the first set,
we talked a lot about the heli plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: where it lives and how it expresses
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to talk a little bit more
generally about cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've certainly done plenty of episodes of
Shaping Fire on cannabinoids for folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: really want to get into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for folks that this is their early
understanding of cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you explain why plants produce
cannabinoids or why we think that they
[SPEAKER_01]: produce cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I would like to say that why
are the type of question that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardest to answer in biology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a bit about any type of
specialized metabolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants produce specialized metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabinoids are type of specialized
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are small molecules, secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike primary metabolites, these are
molecules that the plant doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have them to survive, but it helps them
flourish in their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are molecules that the plant
produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be very, very different between
plants from different families,
[SPEAKER_00]: even from the same family, from different
genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have completely different types
of molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that a plant produces a
specific type of molecule is because it
[SPEAKER_00]: helps them flourish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, it gives them protection
to cope with different types of stresses
[SPEAKER_00]: like for fighting with herbivores or
pathogens that come to try to damage the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide protection from abiotic
stresses like UV radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have antioxidant effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also attract different types of
pollinators or seed dispersers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, it is not known for sure
what is the actual role of cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's believed that it's possibly one of
these that I mentioned now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for sure, the plant produces
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It invests a lot of energy to produce
these cannabinoids because it gives them
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of evolutionary advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this discovery change or evolve our
understanding of the evolution of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that while we were surprised
and excited to find cannabinoids in this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, there may be other plants that are
also expressing in similar ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But have we finding cannabinoids in this
plant kind of changed our understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it for sure helps trying to
answer the reason why the plant evolved to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What might have happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the evolution encourage the plant
or push the plant to start producing these
[SPEAKER_00]: types of molecules?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basis comes from the enzymes,
from the biology of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a plant will not start to produce
molecules that are very, very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not make up an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably an enzyme that is already
there, a type of protein that is already
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant that will mutate slowly until
it makes some change that the plant feels
[SPEAKER_00]: that is advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is maintained for next
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we believe that by looking into other
members of the families from other types
[SPEAKER_00]: of helicrisms, other types of plants from
the astrocea family, because helicrism is
[SPEAKER_00]: an astrocea plant, which is very distant
than cannabis, which is a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by looking into other family members
that don't produce cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when we are looking into what other
chemicals they do produce, we found some
[SPEAKER_00]: commonalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, we think that in order for
a plant to produce cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will start by having probably a natil
activating enzyme that will use fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: acids to produce this alkyl chain that we
have for cannabinoids, or that is also
[SPEAKER_00]: found for fluoroglucinoids, which are also
found in hops, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will have a polyketid synthase that
will probably do a specific type of
[SPEAKER_00]: cyclisation, for example, for making
fluoroglucinoids or chalcons, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: more available in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these will possibly mutate into making
the backbones, the chemical structure for
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids or the amorphous protein
types of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will start to do a different type
of cyclisation, which we see in both these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have a cranial
transferase that we found in our study
[SPEAKER_00]: that was very specific, that they would
work only on the types of molecules that
[SPEAKER_00]: have this, it's a resorcinolic backbone,
which is found in cannabinoids versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: one from fluoroglucinoids or the other
types of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that we have some clues about
what types of plants would also perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: produce or can be good candidates to
produce cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, there are also a lot of
questions that we didn't look at still
[SPEAKER_00]: that have to do with, for example,
localisation of enzymes, transport,
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity, availability of intermediates
for this pathway to evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listening to your answer, there are so
many different opportunities for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: research, for botanical research,
for healing opportunities in so many of
[SPEAKER_01]: the different, I don't know, research
opportunities that you just went through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as somebody who has studied the
endocannabinoid system, it is just so
[SPEAKER_01]: wildly exciting to have another way in to
start to compare and contrast with the
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants that we're already familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is before you add all of the
additional other terpenes and other
[SPEAKER_01]: aromatic compounds that are also
interacting with all these cannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_01]: create new ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant itself, is it hard to grow
the heli plant or is it pretty easy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started growing it from seeds and
actually it wasn't that easy to germinate
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since once we managed to germinate,
we propagated using cuttings and these
[SPEAKER_00]: grow very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, up to this point,
we haven't been able to produce seeds out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants, our mature plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they produce seeds, but they don't
germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up until now, we've only propagated
them via cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a whole... But it grows very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow them in a greenhouse and they
flourish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though you're not producing viable
seeds yet, is the plant itself and seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: for it very easy to get in South Africa or
is it a rare plant there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that in South Africa, it grows
wild in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that it's very easy to get
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's a plant that grows wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I understand, I've never been
there, but when you walk around,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see these plants everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the lab, I'm curious to know what
extraction methods you use to remove the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids to isolate them and is the
extraction or isolation process with this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant any easier or more difficult than
cannabis or is it about the same because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just trying to get cannabinoids out
of plant material?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as what we do for cannabis,
to extract cannabinoids from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many ways that you can
extract these, but what we usually do in
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab is just a simple ethanolic
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may not know this next question
because it's very cannabis user centric,
[SPEAKER_01]: but are you familiar at all with how
traditional cannabis enthusiasts will use
[SPEAKER_01]: ice water and ice to make the trichomes on
a cannabis plant cold and then mix them so
[SPEAKER_01]: the trichomes break off and settle into
the bottom and then are concentrated that
[SPEAKER_01]: way to make hashish?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that be possible with this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the trichomes brittle and removable
like that on this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trichomes on this plant have,
although they are also trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have quite a different structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a much shorter stalk compared to
the ones from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did try to purify trichomes because
we were interested in doing an analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: single trichomes and it was much harder to
do than in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we're curious to know,
can we make hash out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the cannabinoid levels vary depending
on the growing conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you've gotten to that part
of the research yet, but it's worth
[SPEAKER_01]: asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't get to that part yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that they will change just like
any other type of plant that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any type of specialized metabolites in
plants will change in response to specific
[SPEAKER_00]: types of stress or growing conditions for
the good or for the bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the plant contain cannabinoids
throughout its entire life cycle or only
[SPEAKER_01]: at certain stages?
[SPEAKER_00]: We found them in all the stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in all the tissues besides the roots,
as I mentioned, and since it's an all year
[SPEAKER_00]: round growing plant, you have them all
year round as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like in cannabis where you
need, you start growing and then you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to wait until you get the plant to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a limited amount of time
that the plant is flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, you need to have
another cycle here at the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just grows all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use the biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds also that since the trichomes
have got cannabinoids in it year round,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it might be possible to treat this as
an ever growing plant too, where maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing a larger shrub of it and
you harvest half of it and then you let
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of it go and then you harvest it
again later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that seem reasonable for this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from what you've seen so far,
and I understand this research may not
[SPEAKER_01]: have been done yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you found any potential benefits that
might make it superior to cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: certain cannabinoid applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, the fact that it has high
CBG, like we mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_00]: versus other types of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the fact that it has no THC,
it makes its legal status much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not illegal like cannabis,
even cannabis that is high CBD with very
[SPEAKER_00]: low amounts of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in the same status as the heli
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we mentioned, we have all year round
supply of cannabinoids and the leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: are the most abundant ones, so you don't
need to wait for flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the fact that you have
cannabinoids that are not present in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, it's also another advantage that
might have different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: bio-activities as well as also
non-cannabinoid molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, you have these cannabinoids,
for example, but these are very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very much, much lower concentrations
compared to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the heli plant, you have a lot of
flavonoids, more fructins and other types
[SPEAKER_00]: of compounds that are very abundant and
look like similar concentrations like the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the aroma of the plant itself when
you're in the greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a very light perfume smell,
nothing like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it more floral and pleasant or is it
more like stanky beautiful?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it's like a floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a perfume.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you started publishing your results
and people started noticing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: have you gotten the support that you would
hope to have gotten in order to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: with this research and increase our
familiarity with the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like the reaction to your
research itself was positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm asking this question more about the
going concern, like going into the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have the support that you need now
to continue this research to get us more
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I mean, we have no barriers at the
moment to continue this type of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the biggest barrier is time
because we are also studying other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have other goals that we want to
achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is definitely something that we
are planning to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some more questions that we are
planning to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we don't have any problems
continuing working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in set three, we're going to talk more
about the future and what some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies of interacting with this plant
look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for right now, we're going to take our
second commercial break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is plant biochemist Dr. Paula
[SPEAKER_01]: Berman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please support them and let them know
that you heard of them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Revenue is tight for cannabis businesses
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no question about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when revenue tightens, businesses need
to spend smarter on advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of throwing obscene money at
hanging your company's logo from the
[SPEAKER_01]: rafters at your next convention,
perhaps consider placing commercials on
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are a very small business,
there is simply no better bang for your
[SPEAKER_01]: buck than commercials on Shaping Fire,
especially if your products are for
[SPEAKER_01]: regeneratively minded cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service or brand
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way that really lets people know what
sets your company apart from the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable and help
[SPEAKER_01]: our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately and
[SPEAKER_01]: with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a commercial on Shaping Fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_01]: of their headphones right now and will
continue to reach new listeners as they
[SPEAKER_01]: explore the Shaping Fire back catalog of
episodes again and again for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A spot on Shaping Fire costs less than a
postcard per person and the Shaping Fire
[SPEAKER_01]: audience is full of smart cannabis
enthusiasts, cultivators and entrepreneurs
[SPEAKER_01]: who are always curious to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now in the new year,
we are booking the few open spots we have
[SPEAKER_01]: for the rest of 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love for you to be one of our new
advertisers.

[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long time heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb, also known as Inspector and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle is a breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_01]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_01]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year here on Vashon Island and
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_01]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a moment right now and visit Humboldt
CSI dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_01]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Humboldt CSI dot com.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is plant biochemist Dr. Paula
[SPEAKER_01]: Berman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking, Dr. Berman and I were
talking during the break about how much I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like a cheerleader for this plant
because all of us who have been studying
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and have been caring about
endocannabinoid medicine for years and
[SPEAKER_01]: have worked with the plant, we've all got
this very close relationship with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're always trying to find the plant
and learn about the plant to find out that
[SPEAKER_01]: there is another plant that produces
cannabinoids in these volumes that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the same legal structures around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels like this huge opportunity
where we can practice healing in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that might not be so inaccessible due to
the laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fun to, I'm probably going to
embarrass you a little bit, Paula,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're kind of like a hero to us,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the research that you're doing is
something that we all are looking for and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're at the front of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know I'm fanboying about it,
but I have a feeling that you don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: enough of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm just letting my freak flag fly
so that you understand how much we
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate this research that you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like to mention that this
project has been like a dream project to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with cannabis for almost five
years before I came to the Weizmann
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids is kind of my true passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having the opportunity to work on this
study that was so preliminary,
[SPEAKER_00]: the information that was known about it
was so preliminary and everything that we
[SPEAKER_00]: found was new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking about how the prospects of
working on this topic and what can come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of this study is truly exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't go away listener yet because we
still have more to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this seems like a really good time for
me to ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have mentioned a couple of times how
important the other people involved have
[SPEAKER_01]: been in this research and you asked for an
opportunity to acknowledge them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it's just fitting to go
ahead and put that in here and then we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: continue with our conversation on
pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who are those other people?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are folks that you wanted to make
sure to acknowledge?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to mention that I was
part of a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work with Professor Asafa on his lab
in the Weizmann Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's, of course, the principal
investigator of true inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, he's like such an enthusiast about
plant science and everything related to
[SPEAKER_00]: small molecules and biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned so much from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted also to acknowledge Luis Adam,
Prashant, three other postdocs that also
[SPEAKER_00]: worked on this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luis is a bioinformatician and he did all
the genome and the transcriptome in this
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam and Prashant did a lot of the
molecular biology and taught me how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the things that we did here in
this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dong was also a postdoc that helped me
with the maldeimaging and feeding of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Tali from the NMR unit and
Smadarin Dayal from the electronic
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopic unit, microscope unit in the
Weizmann Institute that helped me really
[SPEAKER_00]: have the most amazing images of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many other people that I will not
mention, although they contributed a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: other people from the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the opportunity to
mention them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you to everyone on your team.
[SPEAKER_01]: for this very important research that
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's continue to look a
little bit more forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're at this interesting time with
this plant where we're still doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: fundamental research to figure out how
this plant expresses itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also know that pharmaceutical companies
are always looking for early stage new
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have we gotten to the part that
pharmaceutical companies are starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: become engaged with this research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are we still a little early yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for us, it's still an early
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have not been doing any active
research with pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am sure that it will also come.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think will be the long term?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I want to say this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What extraction method seems to work best
on this plant as far as moving towards
[SPEAKER_01]: scaled solutions?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you mentioned in the lab that
you like to use ethanol, which is what a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of home cannabis preparation preparers
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it's scaled up, they use
different extraction styles for large
[SPEAKER_01]: volumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will they likely be the same extraction
varieties at scale as we see with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are there any intricacies in the plant
that would make that not as elegant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I believe that the same types of
extraction methods that apply to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: will also be applied here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, we also used to do a lot of
ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were studying cannabis,
ethanol extraction also, when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: scaling up, I know that at least here in
Israel, it's considered like the standard
[SPEAKER_00]: method to make extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works pretty well also with Hele
plant, especially because when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: intended for patients, you don't want to
use organic solvents or other methods that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be hazardous to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your team working on breeding programs
at all to increase the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: production?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are we at the point where we're just
trying to figure out how that's taking
[SPEAKER_01]: place to begin with?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we in the Weizmann Institute don't work
on breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to do some genetic
engineering transformation for the Hele
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have not succeeded yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely one of the things that
we want to do to have the potential to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to knock out genes or to add genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, imagine the possibility of
adding CBDA synthase into the Hele plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that will allow you to make CBDA in the
plant we are talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's one gene that will take
CBGA to produce CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there might be also some other
genes or some other proteins that are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to have this ability is, of course,
with very high potential and very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also to have the ability to knock out
genes to even for Hele, even for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: study what the role of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you asked me before what is the role of
cannabinoids to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the best ways that one would be
able to test this is if you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability, if you have a system to do
transformation of a plant, to knock out
[SPEAKER_00]: specific genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you will have your mutant and you
will have the wild type plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can take both and test them
with different types of stresses to see
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with pollinators, interaction
with bacteria and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help you answer this type of
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that we study in the lab a
lot is the biosynthetic pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the aims of this study,
besides the chemistry and all the work
[SPEAKER_00]: that we did, was also to identify the
biosynthetic pathway, how the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: produces cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we found the specific enzymes,
then we have the ability, we show how we
[SPEAKER_00]: can take these enzymes outside of the
plant and express them in a heterologous
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being either other plants or in
bacteria or in yeast and then to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: production of cannabinoids without having
the limitations of the plant or even to
[SPEAKER_00]: test this same question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take, for example, just as a tomato
or you take a tobacco or some other model
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that people use, biologists,
plant scientists use, that you know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: transform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take the whole pathway of
cannabinoids and you put it inside these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, you have the tomato,
the white type tomato, and you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use these systems to try to
understand what these cannabinoids do to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, whether it helps them survive,
in which conditions cope with which
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You describe so much different research
all taking place on the plant at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people do you have working on in
the lab on these projects?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sounds like a huge number of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this specific project brought together
several different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not all of them working full time only
on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several helped according to their
specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but this is one advantage of working
in this lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that you have such a
multidisciplinary team of analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: chemists and then molecular biologists and
bioinformaticians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's a really it's a big
blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the type of lab where you can do this
type of work where you can ask these
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and having all the tools that
you need to answer them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just let us know, is it more or
less than 50 people?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's less than 50 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a lot of passionate people
cross-working on each other's projects so
[SPEAKER_01]: that everyone's project is lifted up at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There must be a lot of excitement moving
around the different cells of the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: For yourself, what are we likely to see as
the next published research coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: your lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, we do in the lab a lot of
things also not related to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this was the only story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also working on cannabis and we
have a study that will be published,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope, in the coming months, which I
cannot say too much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because I don't want to scoop us that
we are having some really cool results
[SPEAKER_00]: also on this other cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the other people in the lab
don't work on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of researchers on very
different types of we ask different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of questions, questions related to plant
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me specifically, in the lab in the last
years, I've been working on psychoactive
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year, we also published a paper on
the biosynthetic pathway of mescaline in
[SPEAKER_00]: piote, in hallucinogenic cacti,
where we elucidated the biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am working on another pathway that
hopefully will be published in the coming
[SPEAKER_00]: months, which is also not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids, but psychedelic chemistry,
which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed reading that research last
night, actually, in preparing for our
[SPEAKER_01]: other aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stumbled across the peyote paper and I'm
like, my gosh, Dr. Berman is doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: most interesting research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got two questions for you kind of
in moving us to wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we understand that the genie is out of
the bottle, if you will, as far as this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the cannabinoids are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there are a lot of them and
that the plant is easier to use because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the legal reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious, though, because we're still
in the early stages when we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: find the basics about the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you foresee say 10 years down the
line being the status of this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: You see faster than anybody how quickly
this research is taking place and the
[SPEAKER_01]: areas that are more likely to blossom to
allow the pun.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see our relationship with this
plant in 10 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can tell you what I would like to
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really like to see a lot more
research done on the bioactivities of the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules that the plant produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really like to see that there is a
transformation platform to do
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation of the plants and to be
able to answer all these really amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting questions that I mentioned
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to have basically to have a new even
new types of molecules that we can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: and to learn much more about the plant and
to have available products from the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: or inspired by the molecules in the
helicrism plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if it's not from heli,
but once we learn about the bioactivities
[SPEAKER_00]: of these molecules, so to have the
opportunity of having having them produce
[SPEAKER_00]: even outside of the plant in other
platforms or other systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully that they will help also
patients or people that need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we do research shows, I try to end
with this question because I always want
[SPEAKER_01]: to encourage young new science minded
folks who are in college or just out to
[SPEAKER_01]: inspire them that there is still so much
research to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be done in cannabinoids that this area
is just starting to blossom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great time to get into this
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of advice would you give of the
types of things to perhaps study and to
[SPEAKER_01]: bone up on for cannabinoid researchers who
are still in college, but would like to
[SPEAKER_01]: start moving into researching with this
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kinds of backgrounds and preparations
should they be making?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I would tell them to go for
it, to go for studying cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's a platform that can
combine so many different disciplines,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting from plant science, chemistry,
biology, of course, medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many questions that can be
answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is such a big, huge potential to
help other people by combining these
[SPEAKER_00]: disciplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would even advise people not to stick
to only one part of the research,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to actually combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look into the plant, see how the plant
does what it does, and then try to go
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the plant and also to test,
to understand what it does to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how hard we can push or use the plant
for new drugs or new treatments or new
[SPEAKER_00]: medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also suggest that it's
important to keep in mind that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: still in the scientific community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still considered a bit of a
controversial subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that go into studying
cannabinoids need to be aware that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes we find people, researchers that
work in this field, that it has kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sometimes hard to raise money for
grants or convince researchers that what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing is serious research and that
also when you want to submit or to
[SPEAKER_00]: publish, there are sometimes journalists
that don't look into cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the potential is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, Dr. Berman.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we really appreciate when a
scientist like yourself who is in deeply
[SPEAKER_01]: and on the front lines and not usually
available to just regular folks like us,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you make the time to come out of the
lab and into the daylight and talk to us
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we can encourage you and to learn
what you're doing and to encourage those
[SPEAKER_01]: who fund your research to fund more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for sharing your time and
your insight and your good cheer with us
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we could learn more about this
absolutely beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, dear listener, if you would like to
keep up with Dr. Berman, there are two
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can follow her on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that is as Paula Berman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you have a science specific
question, you can reach Dr. Berman through
[SPEAKER_01]: her email address for the lab,
which is BermanSH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So B-E-R-M-A-N-S-H at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very simple like that.
