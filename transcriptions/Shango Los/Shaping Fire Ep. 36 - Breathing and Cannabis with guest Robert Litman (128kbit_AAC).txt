[SPEAKER_02]: Breathing is at the heart of what it means
to be a living human.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't usually think about it much,
because breathing is an autonomic function
[SPEAKER_02]: and happens without us even really
thinking about it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, when we inhale cannabis,
we spend a lot more time choosing our
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite strain-end smoking or vaping
device than we do thinking about the role
[SPEAKER_02]: our lungs play in this process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because cannabis is a bronchial dilator,
many who use cannabis think that means
[SPEAKER_02]: that cannabis cannot injure or impact our
lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's simply not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wishful thinking for us to think that
whatever we inhale will be fine so long as
[SPEAKER_02]: it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reality is far more complex than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inhaling cannabis can help lungs in many
ways for sure, but there's also methods
[SPEAKER_02]: that negatively impact the lungs as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, if you are toking on a
budget, there are definitely ways to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: that are more effective at getting you
high with less flour or oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Common myths about cannabis in the lungs
are easily spread while hanging out with
[SPEAKER_02]: friends smoking bulls or even easier over
the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that does not make them true.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are proven and well-established
health insights about breathing that can
[SPEAKER_02]: improve your use of cannabis, whether it
be for health or fun.

[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Robert Littman.
[SPEAKER_02]: For over 30 years, Robert Littman has
guided clients and students in the use of
[SPEAKER_02]: movement, breath, and sound as a tool for
personal growth and efficient body
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He co-developed the Wellsprings
Practitioner Program with Emily Conrad,
[SPEAKER_02]: founder of Continuum Movement,
and co-taught with her for 18 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on the faculty of Continuum
Movement until 2014 and has made many
[SPEAKER_02]: contributions to Continuum's practices,
particularly in the sciences,
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporating respiratory physiology,
neuroanatomy, and cellular biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert has been a faculty member and head
of the Departments of Anatomy and
[SPEAKER_02]: Physiology and Movement Education at the
Desert Institute of the Healing Arts
[SPEAKER_02]: Massage School.
[SPEAKER_02]: He teaches the Buteco breathing technique,
helping people with a variety of
[SPEAKER_02]: disorders, and is also an organizing
member, registered educator, and trainer
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Buteco Breathing Educators
Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert has advanced certifications in the
Dougan French approach and somatic pattern
[SPEAKER_02]: recognition and a graduate certification
as a breathing behavior analyst.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also a specialist in breathing and
the use of ethyogenic psychoactive
[SPEAKER_02]: substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: He founded his personal practice,
The Breathable Body, in 2003 and regularly
[SPEAKER_02]: leads classes and workshops worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, Robert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we get into the mechanics of
breathing, I want to set the tone
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly for this show because,
you know, it's important for folks to get
[SPEAKER_02]: that you are very integrative and holistic
in your practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've already described your
practice in the introduction, but would
[SPEAKER_02]: you set the context for us by explaining
how cannabis inhalation can increase our
[SPEAKER_02]: awareness of breathing and the body as a
whole towards the general betterment of
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody who tokes cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one of the things that I have played
with and discovered for myself as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: for my clients is that cannabis increases
body awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say body awareness, it's our
ability to be able to sense what is going
[SPEAKER_00]: on inside of our bodies, sort of like an
animal does, you know, is operating from
[SPEAKER_00]: their senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we operate from our senses,
we're more in touch with how breathing is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually moving inside of our organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by being able to sense that and feel
into how our lungs open, how our body
[SPEAKER_00]: spreads out when we breathe in and how it
comes back into its normal shape when we
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe out, we'll be able to then have
better access to using our breath to
[SPEAKER_00]: soothe our nervous system and to let the
cannabis and its bronchodilating effects
[SPEAKER_00]: open up our airways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like that particular piece of the
awareness that gets included in smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or taking it in other forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that when we learn that about
ourselves, even when we are not using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, we're able to implement what
we've learned just throughout the day to
[SPEAKER_00]: help soothe our nervous system and any
kind of breathing disorders that we may
[SPEAKER_00]: have that cannabis can support.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know we're going to be talking a lot
about the relationship between cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: breathing and anxiety today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you break out just a little bit how
breathing interacts with the nervous
[SPEAKER_02]: system?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the mechanism, by the way,
it even has the ability to soothe us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we relax, cannabis can have the
effect of relaxing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tend to breathe from a deeper place
within side of your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more down in the lower belly,
your diaphragm is more active in
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing, which sets the tone for the
nervous system to recognize that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: on fight or flight, that it's a time for
the body to be in a more parasympathetic
[SPEAKER_00]: mode of relaxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're anxious, we tend to breathe up
high in our chest, which is a much smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's sending a message to our
nervous system that something is
[SPEAKER_00]: threatening us and so that we're in fight
or flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're in fight or flight,
we're breathing way too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually in the case of people who are
anxious and not moving quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: fight or flight, there's a mismatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of adrenaline running
through the system, but we're not moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the body gets anxious, thinks what's
happening, where's the threat,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what am I supposed to do about it
right in this particular moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mind gets really active in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were really in fight or flight and
running for our lives, there would be no
[SPEAKER_00]: mind involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis has this ability to,
if it can, for you soften the nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: system, soften your breathing,
relax the body so that you're breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: more from your diaphragm and more with
ease and at a slower pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biggest issue too, is breathing
at a slower pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're really anxious or if we're
having an asthma attack, we'll tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe 20 to 30 times per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal breathing rate is about 12 to 14
times, maybe even eight to 12 breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: breaths per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're really in parasympathetic
mode and really relaxed, we're breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: around six breaths per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the learning that we're
looking for, is how to establish both the
[SPEAKER_00]: pace and the rhythm of breathing and also
the volume of breathing, that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing less per minute than we are if
we're in fight or flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big issue right there,
which we can talk about in a few more
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, why that's so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though I didn't just toke,
the fact that you and I are talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: breathing is increasing the awareness of
my breath, which now I'm doing it with
[SPEAKER_02]: more awareness and I notice it's slowing
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm excited because we're doing the
recording, but I've just calmed myself
[SPEAKER_02]: down just by listening to you talk about
healthy breathing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So awareness is everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about now the actual
mechanics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We all take breathing for granted,
but there are right ways and wrong ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our body actually has to do several
things for us to successfully breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank goodness that it's on autopilot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can unpack this later on when we're
talking about some of the challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you explain the mechanics of
inhalation?
[SPEAKER_00]: The mechanics of inhalation, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really clear question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we breathe in the inhalation,
the diaphragm is descending.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the major breathing muscle that is
right down at the lower ribs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the diaphragm moves properly and
lowers down towards your pelvis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's increasing the size of your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stretching the bottom of the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second stage is the ribs on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had your hands on the side of your
ribs, they will start to elevate and that
[SPEAKER_00]: begins to take the lungs in a width.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's opening up the lungs to be wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a really full and big breath when you
need a lot more air, then the front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chest will move, which will increase the
dimension of the lung front to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the function of that is to change the
internal pressure of the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the lungs are fully closed and
we're at the end of the exhale,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pressure inside the lung is less than
the pressure outside in the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is surprising, but it is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the lungs begin to open up at
the pull of the diaphragm and the ribs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pressure outside of the body is
greater than the pressure inside this
[SPEAKER_00]: space is expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens automatically is air
is drawn into the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like you say, we don't even
have to think about it, but because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure changes, in physics, it wants to
move from a higher pressure gradient to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lower pressure gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lung, the air is coming into the lungs
to equalize the pressure both outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our lungs fill automatically,
which is what happens when we're sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not thinking about it, which is one
of the amazing things about breathing that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's both under our control and it happens
automatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably a really healthy fail safe
for our human that as we exhale,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's like an automatic bounce back to
inhaling again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes evolutionary sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, there is a fail safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people who faint, a lot of people have
experiences of getting up to speak or
[SPEAKER_00]: being on a radio show where they get
anxious and they start to breathe too fast
[SPEAKER_00]: and they begin to hyperventilate and they
get dizzy and they pass out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the fail safe right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't kill yourself by breathing too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll end up fainting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mechanism of fainting,
of course, is that when you're fainted,
[SPEAKER_00]: your body will go back to breathing at a
rate that is actually commensurate for
[SPEAKER_00]: what the body needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're coming back to normal that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as somebody with lifelong asthma,
I've always thought that inhaling cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: would be bad for the lungs because of the
resin collecting on the lung cilia inside
[SPEAKER_02]: and gooping those up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I always expected the throat and
the lung to be irritated from the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got laughed at on a lot of social
media threads about that belief.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I read more and more about it and
it does seem that I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more studies that I read about
tobacco inhalation, marijuana inhalation,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's dabbing or joints,
they all seem to suggest that overall
[SPEAKER_02]: inhaling cannabis is good for the lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can that be so?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why isn't inhaling cannabis smoke coating
our lungs with additional resin and making
[SPEAKER_02]: things worse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the things you have to speak
about first is how much are you going to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke at one time, how much you're taking
in, what kind of volume and what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: heat it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of asthma, there are strains
that are bronchodilators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually, in my own reading too,
there are six ways that cannabis actually
[SPEAKER_00]: helps the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to be careful about how much
you smoke and how much heat is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you know there's too much
heat in the smoke, you're coughing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is actually a reaction to kind of
push out what got in there that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at other effects of it in
terms of microdosing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at anti-inflammatories,
antibacterial, bronchodilators,
[SPEAKER_00]: dilation, and anti-spasmatic, and it's an
analgesic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bronchodilating effect is the most
important because with asthma,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what happens when you're starting
to have an asthma attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smooth muscle in the airways is
contracting in a way that doesn't allow
[SPEAKER_00]: the air to be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis offers that effect where it
hits the smooth muscle and it relaxes it
[SPEAKER_00]: to let the airflow begin again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in terms of what you're talking
about in terms of the resins, it just
[SPEAKER_00]: really depends on how much you smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of the readings and most of
the studies that have been done with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis are about small doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's interesting that really there's
a threshold point where the regularity of
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking cannabis switches over from being
necessarily healthy for the lungs to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually being potentially detrimental.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, I'm sure that everybody
like me is wondering how do we know where
[SPEAKER_02]: that point is?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm assuming that it's different for
every person, but do we really only know
[SPEAKER_02]: where our threshold is when we reach it
and we start experiencing negative side
[SPEAKER_02]: effects from too much smoke inhalation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: My experience is the fact that the smoke
and the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about mucus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lungs have this ability to make
mucus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you start to expectorate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to notice that you have a little
bit more mucus and that you're coughing
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is that mucus being produced in the
first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being produced to protect the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is irritating the lungs beyond
what they normally need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the body's making more mucus to cover
it up and to help it move out because the
[SPEAKER_00]: mucus is meant to either be swallowed or
coughed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my experience is when I start to feel
like I've got more mucus in my body,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I'm smoking too much and that
I'm putting too many irritants into my
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually makes a lot of sense too,
because people in cannabis often will joke
[SPEAKER_02]: about the mucus or feeling chunky after a
big session.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I myself, when I go to full weekend
cannabis events that are more party than
[SPEAKER_02]: convention, like Emerald Cup down in
Sonoma County, at the end of Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_02]: by the time I'm driving home, I feel like
there's been a war zone in my lungs or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They feel sore and tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is from successive joints with
friends and colleagues at the event,
[SPEAKER_02]: because certainly my usage goes up at
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said something really important there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the sore and then overused.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a, we are so,
let's see, what's the word I want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so unaware is the best word I
can come up with at the moment about how
[SPEAKER_00]: our lungs are really taking care of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they are the most essential thing
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we could talk about our heart being
very essential, but the way the heart
[SPEAKER_00]: runs, of course, is that it has to receive
the oxygen that the lungs bring in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a rule of three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go three minutes without breath,
three days without water, three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: without food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the most essential process that our
body goes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take it for granted most of the
time so that when our lungs are feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: sore and feeling tired, it's a time that
we can say to ourselves, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: your lungs, our lungs, they've been taking
care of us for a really long time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about I slow down, relax, let my body
breathe in a quiet way, let me take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of my lungs for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we go to the break and in our
second set, we're going to talk a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: about vaporizers and the difference
between that and smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to hit one more moment on
different warning signs or at least like
[SPEAKER_02]: little yellow flags that people can look
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned mucus, which I'm sure is
maybe even the most prevalent one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when somebody is new to cannabis and
they don't have the experience of years
[SPEAKER_02]: and years of it, like many folks do,
what things can they look for to let them
[SPEAKER_02]: know that they may be reaching their
outside threshold of inhalation and so
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe need to start considering,
you know, tinctures and other,
[SPEAKER_02]: other less inhaled cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's interesting about what the
other thing that drives, the other thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that drives breathing is the ratio between
carbon dioxide and oxygen in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time we think about the
oxygen as the nutrient and carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: is the waste gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually the truth of that is that
carbon dioxide regulates the distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: of oxygen in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I talked about hyperventilating,
the reason we faint is because the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide levels get so low because we're
blowing it out all the time that the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen distribution to the brain slows
down and we faint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same thing with smoking too
much cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, especially if you're exhaling
big exhales, you're disrupting the blood
[SPEAKER_00]: gases in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can start to get headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start to get tingling in your
hands and feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start to feel your blood pressure
rise, your heart rate increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are signs that perhaps you're
exhaling too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and it may be exhaling a lot
through your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could think about exhaling through
your nose, but those would be some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: signs that you're, you're overdoing
dehydration would be another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are, those are some of the signs
because you're disrupting the blood gases.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so based on that, would it be a safe
to say rule of thumb that taking more
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller hits is going to be better for our
lungs than taking monster bravado hits?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's also changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to think that we had to hold the
air, the smoke in our lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's been proven inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't need to do that holding of
our breath, which does cause the breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: rate to get disturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can breathe in small, small
amounts, let it come in and then put it
[SPEAKER_00]: right out as well as taking it into your
mouth first and then let it cool there and
[SPEAKER_00]: then going into the lungs rather than
taking it right into the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, smaller hits are much more
profitable than really big hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you brought up that, that myth
because you know, there's a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even, even I, I, I've believed
that for, you know, 20 some years that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you take the hit and I want to hold
it as long as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm thinking that it's, it's soaking
into my lungs and I want all the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids to soak into my lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then if I could,
I just want to, you know, exhale clear
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've got it all now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, and, and I know that that's
wrong, but I don't know why that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is wrong with that understanding of
how the cannabinoids are taken in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the lungs that I don't have to hold my
breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one thing is the fact of what
happens to the breathing rate and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the, the rhythm of the breath gets
disrupted by holding your breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that pattern can carry over into
real life, but it's also keeping the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lungs too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the, that's where the damage
can be done by the smoke is having it be
[SPEAKER_00]: circulating inside the lungs for too long
a length of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just needs to come in, absorb what it
needs to absorb and, and release it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, the fallacy in the thinking is
that, um, uh, and, and infinite amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids can be, uh, absorbed through
the lungs in any particular breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the reality is, is that, um,
if you just take a, you know, a small to
[SPEAKER_02]: medium sized hit, uh, breathe it in the,
the capacity for the lungs to intake
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids is going to be hit its limits
and then you exhale and that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you take a bigger hit and you hold
it for longer, you're actually causing
[SPEAKER_02]: damage without actually any increased
benefit because your lungs can fill
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves up with all the cannabinoids
that they can take in just with a simple,
[SPEAKER_02]: small hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that a red red blood cells line up
singularly as they travel through the
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs and it takes three quarters of a
second for a red blood cell to pick up the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen and then whatever else it's going
to pick up from the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's on its way in three quarters of a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece of, so you can imagine
that the parade's going, it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: bloodstream is very available to pick up
what's ever in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece of that is that if you
start holding your, holding your breath
[SPEAKER_00]: with the air in there, you're
overstretching like a rubber band that's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting used too much in its stretched
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so eventually it's a possibility if
you're smoking and holding it for long
[SPEAKER_00]: periods of time, you could be doing damage
to the elasticity of the lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the break, we're going to start
talking about vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take that short break
and be right back.

[SPEAKER_02]: Because I often mention that I have asthma
on Shaping Fire, I get emails from folks
[SPEAKER_02]: asking me what vaporizers I recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, certainly there's a wide range of
interesting vapes on the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: but since this episode is all about
breathing today, I'm going to take a
[SPEAKER_02]: moment and tell you about the two vapes
and one filter that I use pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most luxurious vaporizer I have is the
Vapexhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's considered a desktop vaporizer,
but it's also easy to travel with in a
[SPEAKER_02]: padded case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It plugs into the wall and because of
that, it gets up to temperature very fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only is that great for just not
waiting around, but it packs enough power
[SPEAKER_02]: to give a really solid satisfactory dab
hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Vapexhale can use either flour or dab
oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: For flour, you grind up the material and
drop it in a basket and you place that
[SPEAKER_02]: basket in the base.
[SPEAKER_02]: For dab oil, you place your dab in a
borosilicate or quartz tube and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: drop that into the base.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a wall-plugged home
appliance, you'll get hits of flour and
[SPEAKER_02]: dab unlike any of you've ever had before,
especially from a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I sold my email after my first
month having a Vapexhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just knew I was never going to use it
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I let the folks at Vapexhale know ahead
of time that I was going to mention their
[SPEAKER_02]: device on the show today and they sent up
a discount code for you to receive 10%
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just type in shaping fire as one word at
checkout.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% off actually matters when buying a
serious device like this, so make sure to
[SPEAKER_02]: use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The website is Vapexhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: The E on the front of exhale is drop,
so it's just vapexhale.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, even in a padded travel case
though, sometimes the Vapexhale is bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: than I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes when I'm like hiking or going to
a show or whatever, I need something for
[SPEAKER_02]: my pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: For that, I use my Airvape X.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the latest model from airvapeusa
.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had their last version too and
I liked it, but the new X version is
[SPEAKER_02]: really just fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more refined than the last version
and clearly is more user-friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Airvape also gets up to temp very
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: For vaping on the go and I like it that
you can set the temperature that you want
[SPEAKER_02]: it to hit and also that it vibrates when
it's ready to vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: In case like I get distracted by chatting
or something, you know, it's all like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, you know, ready to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's especially great because you can
vape both flour and oil in these.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just slide the little concentrates cup
for oil and slide that in and you're good
[SPEAKER_02]: to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also dig the travel case that comes with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super sleek and discreet and more
importantly, it protects my Airvape X from
[SPEAKER_02]: getting beaten up or damaged in my pocket
or luggage.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the same vaporizer you heard about
in the introduction to the show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Airvape has given us a few of these to
give away to people on our email list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you listen to the show, but you're
not on the email list, make sure to
[SPEAKER_02]: subscribe for your chance to win one of
these vapes this month.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll also hear more about Airvape a bit
later on the show because they bought a
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial spot today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know you could be thinking that I'm
recommending the Airvape because they
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor the show, but let me say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have five different travel vaporizers at
home, but the other four all stay at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I go to conventions or to the beach,
it's the Airvape that I grab to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last product I want to mention is the
Filter420.com filter for pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of my asthma, I really got to be
careful with pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since finding the Filter420,
I've been able to enjoy pre-rolls a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you attach the recycled plastic
filter on the end of the joint,
[SPEAKER_02]: it filters out the tar and gives a much
nicer tastier smoking experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is astonishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually kind of gross to see all the
tar that builds up in one of these
[SPEAKER_02]: filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad it isn't going into my lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it certainly doesn't impede my high at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Filter420.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, not a paid ad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: For today's episode on breathing,
I recommend the VapeXHale desktop vape,
[SPEAKER_02]: the AirvapeX pocket vape, and the
Filter420 pre-roll filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your lungs will be happy you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shangolo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our guest this week is breathing
specialist Robert Littman of The
[SPEAKER_02]: Breathable Body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before the break, we were talking a lot
about combustion basics, how to breathe in
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke, what's going on, and why we enjoy
it so much with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we talk vaporizers,
I want to talk about what was essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: the old school vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were using a bong and we didn't want
it to hurt as much, we added ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, that's a good part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to college.
[SPEAKER_02]: So were we kidding ourselves that adding
ice to the bong made it easier on our
[SPEAKER_02]: lungs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did it just make it feel easier because
it makes the experience of the smoke a
[SPEAKER_02]: little less harsh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, is there a difference between
feeling and the truth of that experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all based on feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does cool the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how many times have you burned
your throat?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're burning your throat,
it's the same airways that are inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anything that helps cool it down so
that there's not that burn that has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: rehabilitated by the throat and the lungs
is going to be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of you who put ice in your bongs,
thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those of you who live near the
snow, your snow bongs are still good to go
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about it for using it for asthma
and learning how to use your breath
[SPEAKER_00]: properly with the smoke is you got to stay
somewhat conscious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we're still talking about asthma,
people who listen to the show regularly
[SPEAKER_02]: know that I'm a big fan of vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love smoking joints and bongs as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for daily use, I'm really much more
about the vaporizer because it makes my
[SPEAKER_02]: whole life a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the vaporizers that are out now are
infinitely better than the ones that we
[SPEAKER_02]: had just a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since you are looking at this as more
of a science and doctorly direction,
[SPEAKER_02]: how much truth is there actually to the
idea that vaporizers are healthier for
[SPEAKER_02]: people generally, but especially for
people with breathing issues like
[SPEAKER_02]: asthmatics and COPD and things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you certainly don't get any of the
tars and any of the burn from the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is definitely a cooler smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not even going up over 170,
180 degrees while when you're combusting
[SPEAKER_00]: through a pipe or through paper,
you can be up to 1,000 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's quite a bit of difference right
there alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as, like I said, especially with
papers, you're getting all the
[SPEAKER_00]: particulates that are in the papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with vaporizers, you don't get any of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get any of the ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just getting the vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vapor is carrying the terpenes and
it's carrying the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, experientially, it's much nicer
to the point that when I turn people onto
[SPEAKER_02]: my luxurious VapeXL water pipe vaporizer,
at first, they're not even certain if they
[SPEAKER_02]: got a hit because they're expecting the
irritation and the choking and all of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they normally just say is,
oh, that tastes good, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, a great response.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then by the time they've had their
second or third hit and they've gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: used to the idea that they exhale and it's
more of a light, tasty vapor than it is
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke, people start to get into it at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's going on differently in the
body?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just simply that the body is not
clenching because I'm not smoking in all
[SPEAKER_02]: those extra tars and particulates that you
mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way you say that because the
lungs are very responsive to atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there's things in the atmosphere
like tars and ash, they are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: contract to make sure that they do not
absorb those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with vaporizer, it's not going on
alert.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body's not going on alert.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece that I was going to say
about it is that when you're vaporizing
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't think there's much smoke
coming out, you kind of have to wait to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what the effects are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's actually a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Historically, I would judge how high I was
going to get based on my exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody has a big exhale and it's a
big cloud of smoke and everybody in the
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking circle goes, oh, because that
person's in for a fun ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with a vaporizer, I really have to
judge it in how much I pack into the
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizer because there's not that visual
cue anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly when I was learning first
using how to use a vaporizer, I would both
[SPEAKER_02]: over and under pack until I learned how to
use this new tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, too, that we're talking
about this from additional use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started this conversation around asthma
and about body awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slowing it down, cooling the tempers
down gives a chance for the consciousness
[SPEAKER_00]: and the awareness to actually pay
attention to the process without having to
[SPEAKER_00]: be so reactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You breathe in, breathe out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of sitting with, well,
how's this acting in my body and what kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of medicinal effects is it having right
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if I'm using it at a time that
my lungs are contracting and having a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of an asthmatic attack, I want to feel
that instantaneous dilation that's
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for folks who don't have asthma or
COPD, I would think that this would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: winning strategy for them as well,
simply because for a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you take a monster hit and it has a lot
of particulate smoke in it and you start
[SPEAKER_02]: coughing, perhaps your adrenals kick off a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you get a little anxious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you do get that soreness of the lung
going forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you're just toking for fun,
using a vaporizer may be to your benefit
[SPEAKER_02]: just because it's an easier experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that you're speaking
to about choking, excuse me, choking and
[SPEAKER_00]: coughing, again, when we go back to what
we said earlier in the day about breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: from the diaphragm or breathing from the
chest, coughing and choking are all
[SPEAKER_00]: energies that come upward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't take the body long to get
patterned into a different breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you cough and choke for a little
bit, you'll probably notice right away the
[SPEAKER_00]: next couple of breaths, you're up in your
chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you have to be conscious about
bringing your breathing back down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower part of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're vaporizing easily and taking
small hits on it, you can kind of stay
[SPEAKER_00]: with that experience as you begin to
deepen into your breathing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this next question, I don't know if
you're going to have an answer for this,
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely non sequitur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't seen any studies on it,
but I'm going to ask anyway, because
[SPEAKER_02]: you've already surprised me a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people, when they first start
vaporizing, they say that the high is
[SPEAKER_02]: different than when they're smoking
joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after doing a lot of both and using a
lot of different kinds of vaporizers,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to agree with that to a certain
extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly I can get just as high from a
vaporizer as I can from a joint,
[SPEAKER_02]: but somehow the tenor of it is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little cleaner, it's a little less
violent, but I don't really know why
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suspect it's because there are
attributes to the experience of the high
[SPEAKER_02]: that people feel after smoking a joint
that they don't feel after a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if that was a very
well-worded question, but if you
[SPEAKER_02]: understand where I'm going, what are your
thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I do understand where you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my experience as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm really about engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And participation with an experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that I can be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do notice that, you know, it is a
different kind of high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say I don't feel as high,
but I'm not sure that's exactly accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do feel like I'm not engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body is not engaged with having to
filter out the negative attributes of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking so I can stay more connected to
the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my best answer for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the part that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like being engaged with the process that
I'm participating in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like being engaged with my awareness
that I stay present in my body and in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like getting so far out that I
have to manage too many different
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being high, clearing my throat,
all those different pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the body, what we're not aware of
is that the body is on alert in some way
[SPEAKER_00]: that takes us out of the immediate
enjoyment of the experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a lot of these folks who are
listening, a lot of folks that listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: this show work with COPD patients like I
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of folks talk about COPD
patients, but I have a feeling that people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't really get what's up with that
condition as much as they do with asthma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So will you just describe what COPD is
just so for everyone's understanding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, COPD stands first of all,
the initial stand for chronic obstructive
[SPEAKER_00]: pulmonary disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something's happening in the airways,
so obstruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over time from asthmatics, that's where
it usually develops from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an order of allergies, asthma,
COPD, emphysema, where the airways are so
[SPEAKER_00]: occluded or tightened and twisted that
it's hard to get the air, move air in and
[SPEAKER_00]: out, as well as what's beginning to happen
is that the little air sacs in the lungs,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's 300 million of those little air
sacs that get, move air back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like this little statistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut them open and laid them side by
side, it's a surface area of a tennis
[SPEAKER_00]: court to move air back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those little alveoli start to distend
and they lose their elasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blood vessels that are picking up
oxygen around those alveoli start to
[SPEAKER_00]: separate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the movement of air and oxygen is
hindered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't get as much oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not as saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not saturated as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we go with this with COPD,
it is really important that breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: rhythms and breathing volumes and the
balancing of the blood gases that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available are at their optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if we're getting less oxygen than
normal, we are able to move it to
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just that what we can take in,
what's in our blood, but how does it get
[SPEAKER_00]: from our blood into ourselves where it
does the most good in making the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: that runs our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So COPD is a very debilitating energy
wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bodies don't have enough energy to
operate fully unless they get supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen or learn how to breathe really in
the most effective way to minimize the
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction of not moving the, to any
negatives, of not moving the oxygen from
[SPEAKER_00]: the blood to the cells, but maximizing
that potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I run into patients all the time asking
me about cannabis as a bronchial dilator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to vape it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but when I originally started hearing
this from people, I thought that was
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because with COPD, why would you want to
inhale anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went ahead and I started
looking at the studies and, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and there's, there seemed to be a
mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some to some suggest that you want to,
uh, inhale cannabis vapor so that you are
[SPEAKER_02]: directly applying it to the lungs for the
bronchial dilation and general relaxation
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, but then some talk about,
uh, the potential use of oral tinctures
[SPEAKER_02]: too, which would be more systemic and,
and, and not targeted towards the lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so what are your thoughts about the
benefits of taking a cannabis tincture and
[SPEAKER_02]: their ability to bronchial dilate the
lungs without actually inhaling the vapor
[SPEAKER_02]: for, this is for more severe COPD folks
who are looking for relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm, I'm a big fan of the tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can say a couple of two things
that I'm thinking about right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends what's going on COPD wise,
whether there's something, some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: obstruction that's going on in the lungs
themselves, or whether it's in the airways
[SPEAKER_00]: going towards the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to kind of take a look at
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's more, if the damage is more,
um, systemic in the lungs and I like
[SPEAKER_00]: tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the studies that have been
done are tinctures are a good way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only, the oldest form of
taking cannabis, even in Egypt and ancient
[SPEAKER_00]: times, they use tinctures in India and
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're thinking about bronchial
dilating for asthma or for COPD,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be more effective to do that when
you are having a moment when you really
[SPEAKER_00]: are bronchial constricted, the vape will
get to it much sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just trying to keep the airways
open and relaxed, then tinctures will do
[SPEAKER_00]: the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want, if you're having an
attack and really can't catch your breath
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a, you're not able to move any
air, the tinctures are too slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to vape in that particular
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so taking a tincture is more of a
preventative and, and, and vaping is more
[SPEAKER_02]: like crisis management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so before we go to our second
commercial, I want to create this
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity because, um, uh, when I met
with you, you went through this wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: little breathing exercise and,
um, I think that everybody would,
[SPEAKER_02]: would appreciate having this experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so we're talking about asthma.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about COPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about taking too big of hits
and we're talking about crisis management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and all of these can be answered by
creating a soothing breathing pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and, and this example is,
is you teach this on your, on your YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: channel as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, if, if people hear this,
you know, once in your car with a podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: and you want to hear a longer version of
it, you can, you can get that on,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the breathable body website and on his
YouTube page.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but would you, this is, this is a
short thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only about 90 seconds, but,
but Robert, would you go ahead and do the
[SPEAKER_02]: soothing breathing pattern, um,
exercise for folks?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then after everybody's all
chill, we'll go to commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have a little time for a little
backstory on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go right ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been talking about nose breathing
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just say a couple of things that
nose breathing is the, the way the body
[SPEAKER_00]: uses air most effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: You breathe through your mouth as often as
you eat through your nose is what we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to say in class and that you pace
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breathe through your nose almost
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that is because it's the best
utilization of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body retains more to help the oxygen
move.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you breathe through your mouth,
you give off way too much carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I said, in hyperventilating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen this experience when
somebody's about to faint and they breathe
[SPEAKER_00]: in through a paper bag, that breathing
back their own carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they reduce the ability to faint or
reduce the, uh, they won't fake,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this exercise is designed when you're
feeling anxious or when you're feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're breathing too fast in 81
seconds, how to bring the body back to a
[SPEAKER_00]: little slower breathing rate, as well as
to maximize the use of your carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: to help oxygen get distributed more
quickly, which will bring the system back
[SPEAKER_00]: into relaxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do this in a 90,
81 second exercise and it's up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: count of six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then back from the count of six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll understand when I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're having an asthma attack,
you would do it up to the count of 10 and
[SPEAKER_00]: then come back from 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sit comfortably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you to breathe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you to breathe out and
I'm going to tell you to suspend your
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm having you breathe in, um,
to the rate of two seconds out for the
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of three seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll be holding periodically,
moving from two seconds up to six seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: and back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to breathe harder, be in a
relaxed place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let the air come in as naturally as
it can in this particular time,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever your breathing rate is and rhythm
is, let it be that don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say ready, take a breath in,
take a breath out and suspend your
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, take a breath in, take a breath
out and suspend one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a breath in, take a breath out,
suspend one, two, three, four,
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe in, breathe out, suspend one,
two, three, four, five, breathe in,
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe out, suspend one, two,
three, four, five, six, breathe in,
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe out, suspend one, two,
three, four, five, breathe in,
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe out, suspend one, two,
three, four, five, One, two, three,
[SPEAKER_01]: four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breathe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breathe out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suspend.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breathe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breathe out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suspend.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breathe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breathe out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody nice and relaxing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Robert, I am really calm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am very chill now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this feeling that I have right now is
why I wanted to include it in today's
[SPEAKER_02]: show, because when we did this in person,
it actually makes me feel like I'm gently
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just working with my body's
natural rhythms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only is this great for folks with
asthma and COPD and related blockage type
[SPEAKER_02]: things, but also as more and more people
are experimenting with cannabis and people
[SPEAKER_02]: introduce themselves to dabbing,
and cannabis is getting stronger,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes we can feel anxious when we're
using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this breathing exercise,
so far, it has been 100% effective in me
[SPEAKER_02]: when I get a little off my game and get
anxious when I'm toking.
[SPEAKER_02]: This brings me right back to where I want
to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for something like that to be so
effective and only take a minute and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half of concentration, I would call that
some pretty powerful tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really what's happening with the feeling
of all that breath holding in between is
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the CO2, which is really
allowing the body to flood with oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what you're feeling when
you're feeling a little high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting so much more oxygen to your
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once the brain has more oxygen,
it says, well, okay, we can chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no threat going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fully fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're nourished.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so calm now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and take our second break.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is breathing specialist
Robert Litman.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I certainly still enjoy smoking
joints, I moved over to using vaporizers
[SPEAKER_02]: about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high was a little different than
burning the flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the end, I decided I preferred it
for daily use, especially because I have
[SPEAKER_02]: asthma.
[SPEAKER_02]: More importantly, though, I could taste my
flour so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to express to you how
significantly different cannabis with a
[SPEAKER_02]: good terpene profile tastes when vaped
instead of burned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have brought my vape with me to visit
growers, and they are astonished by the
[SPEAKER_02]: clarity of taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say they feel like they're
tasting their flour for the very first
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Air Vape Vaporizer from airvapeusa.com
is a great device to use on the go or at
[SPEAKER_02]: home.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you pick it up, it feels satisfying
like a medical device.
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't flimsy like many vapes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how the flour is inserted in the
top instead of the bottom, so it travels a
[SPEAKER_02]: shorter path to my mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the cannabis at the top, I get a hit
that feels more substantial, even though
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just inhaling vapor and not
full-bodied smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I use this vape for flour,
hash, and concentrates, I really like that
[SPEAKER_02]: the digital control for the temperature is
right there on the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three clicks of the button, and it fires
up to the temperature I specify really
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly and discreetly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vape concentrates are a milder experience
than dabbing, but you still get the
[SPEAKER_02]: potency in your hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the taste is great, as would be
expected with a low-temp dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that this vape gives quick little
vibrations when it gets to the right
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way, if I'm chatting or distracted
while it's heating up, it lets me know
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are ready for a nice pocket-sized
vaporizer, consider the Air Vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Air Vape X has just come out,
and it's gorgeous and includes many
[SPEAKER_02]: updates.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find more about the Air Vape
Vaporizer at airvapeusa.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you own a cannabis company,
you know that finding good business
[SPEAKER_02]: partners, vendors, and allies is an
essential part of your role.
[SPEAKER_02]: And building your business in a new
industry like cannabis doesn't always make
[SPEAKER_02]: that easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: CannaCon is coming to Boston and Detroit
this summer, and the halls will be filled
[SPEAKER_02]: with every kind of ally you need for a
cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technology, horticulture, packaging,
marketing, legal, human resources,
[SPEAKER_02]: and media—everything you need for your
business will be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your customers will be there,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because CannaCon is a premier cannabis
business and networking event with
[SPEAKER_02]: nationally recognized speakers and the
opportunity to have serious conversations
[SPEAKER_02]: with your business peers and investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reserving yourself a booth at CannaCon can
unlock a lot of doors for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only do you get to network with all
the people who pass your booth,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is not uncommon for CannaCon
vendors to do a million dollars in
[SPEAKER_02]: business during the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: CannaCon's Seattle event in February sold
out well in advance, so reserve your
[SPEAKER_02]: booths now for Detroit, June 1st and 2nd,
and Boston, July 27th and 28th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Attendee tickets are still available for
both events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you reserve a booth or attend just
for a day, do not miss the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_02]: become a serious player in your market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Visit CannaCon.org for tickets,
booth reservations, and more information.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's CannaCon.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shane Golos, and our guest
this week is breathing specialist Robert
[SPEAKER_02]: Litman of The Breathable Body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to tell you, that was one of the
calmest breaks I have ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I needed to do a couple jumping
jacks to get my head back in the game for
[SPEAKER_02]: this last section.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during this last section, we're going
to talk a bit about dabbing and then a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: about ceremonial plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's talk a little bit about what we
know so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: About breathing and dabbing, because most
of these studies around the impacts that
[SPEAKER_02]: dabbing has on the human just haven't been
done yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of opportunity there,
but they just haven't been done yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start with something really
basic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the heat coming off of dab rigs is
extraordinarily hot, especially if
[SPEAKER_02]: someone's using a torch and if they hit it
at a full temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert, is dabbing especially abusive to
the lungs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to other types of inhalation of
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it feels that way to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's the burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I go back to the burning issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The burning issue is going to cause the
lungs and the airways to scar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over time, the repetitive tearing apart
of the epithelial lining, rebuilding the
[SPEAKER_00]: epithelial lining, tear it down,
rebuilding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body is very adaptable in terms of
strengthening what it needs to strengthen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will just solidify some of those
more malleable tissues that are meant to
[SPEAKER_00]: be malleable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over time period, that's a
stiffening of the airways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not what's meant to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that doesn't sound good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, it doesn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an odd part of cannabis culture
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I should say up front that I dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dab using butane torches when I'm out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, I prefer dabbing at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dab, so I'm into concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm not into is that burning
feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems to me that it's an odd aspect
of our cannabis culture that the burning
[SPEAKER_02]: and even sometimes people keeling over
from the amount of things that they
[SPEAKER_02]: inhaled, how's it going to keel over?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a certain amount of hero-ness to
having that big hot dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we're going to evolve
away from that as a scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, the sooner the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the inhalation of terpenes
though?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking a joint is one thing because
there's only so many terpenes to inhale in
[SPEAKER_02]: the joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with a concentrate, those could
theoretically reach a level of terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have yet to see any studies on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's mostly just opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's your hunch as somebody who does
this all day every day?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think that the studies are
going to look like when they're eventually
[SPEAKER_02]: completed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think there'll be toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of the terpenes as aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're doing some aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always looking for the light smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to eventually become more
immune to the terpenes themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body is going to develop a protection
device so they won't be as effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my hunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also makes me concerned about these
custom sauces that people are putting into
[SPEAKER_02]: vape pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, anybody who listens to the show
knows that I'm a big fan of whole plant
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of these custom terpene sauces
people are making, they are being blended
[SPEAKER_02]: based on taste more than they're being
blended based on science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it concerns me that some of these
especially tasty carts that are jam-packed
[SPEAKER_02]: with aftermarket terpenes that are not in
the original makeup of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: the percentage of them are so high so they
taste good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just concerned about their long-term
effects of the lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that that could make me sound
like a negative Nelly or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as somebody who works with patients
every day, this is where my head's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're answering your own question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's an artificial stimulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body doesn't like that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's up the scales, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when someone takes a huge dab,
they are inhaling heavy amounts of THC and
[SPEAKER_02]: other cannabinoids, intense terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen plenty of videos,
and people even joke about this online in
[SPEAKER_02]: memes, where someone takes a huge hit and
keels over, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Their eyes are rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they shake and they fall over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in some circles, their friends laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's part of our scene here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is happening with the delivery of
that hit to the lungs that somehow shuts
[SPEAKER_02]: their human down?
[SPEAKER_02]: How come it doesn't happen to other people
doing entertainment-sized dabs of several
[SPEAKER_02]: grams for a video?
[SPEAKER_02]: It only seems to happen to some people
sometimes when they take a monster hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any suggestions about what
might be going on at the mechanization
[SPEAKER_02]: level?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, each one of us is sensitive in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some people can tolerate pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people can tolerate loud noises.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on a person's nervous
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shutdown is an overload.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body and the nervous system is going,
I can't handle this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much stimulus way too fast for
this particular nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it shuts down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that would make sense why it's
different for every people and probably
[SPEAKER_02]: even why it's probably also related to
tolerance too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over time, you can probably handle more
dab inhalation than you would normalize.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I'm thinking back to the
second set.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually well said that if people are
going to dab, because I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to dab even though I know what
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I have found is that
micro-dabbing is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because just like we were talking earlier
about the very clear reasons why it makes
[SPEAKER_02]: physiological sense to take more smaller
hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you'll be gentler on the lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, honestly, you're preserving your
cannabis as well because you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: wasting it on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But taking more, like a higher number of
micro-dabs, so you're taking more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller inhalation really seems to be the
way to go if people are going to continue
[SPEAKER_02]: with concentrates, which it's just getting
more popular, not less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we come back to the topic of this
show, which was asthma and COPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of have to evaluate when the
micro-dab does its job for you for that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular person, that particular reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using it for other things like
to party and have a good time,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, the studies that have been
done show about 200 micrograms of THC is
[SPEAKER_00]: all you need for the lungs to begin to
expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's overkill in terms of that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of it in terms of alchemy that
we're experimenting at both ends from
[SPEAKER_00]: micro-dosing to dabbing to try to come to
some middle ground that says this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what's really best for the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's becoming so pervasive it's legal
almost everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we're in a candy store now
trying to figure out what's the best candy
[SPEAKER_00]: to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to experiment with all the
candy without suddenly getting obese or
[SPEAKER_02]: having a sugar fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us are learning in the mix,
especially those of us in the industry who
[SPEAKER_02]: are developing these products at the same
time as we're learning how to use these
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the early days of dabbing,
the same people who were dabbing were the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones who were the first extractors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were their own guinea pigs,
which I see a lot in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, heck, I experiment myself with new
techniques and I'm like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: was that a pleasant experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did this CBG tincture work to help with my
back pain or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting how many of us in the
industry are our own guinea pigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the word you used there was
pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this pleasurable or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something that we really as a
culture of value is what's pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the things that
we can do with cannabis, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: microdosing or being gentle with ourselves
is to really find out, is it giving us the
[SPEAKER_00]: results that we want?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does it feel pleasurable to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't I want something that feels
pleasurable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't I want something that's going to
burn me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the pleasure principle there is
something that is a great transition for
[SPEAKER_02]: our last topic because one of the things
that I've enjoyed hearing you speak and
[SPEAKER_02]: watching your videos is that you really
blend science, ceremonial plant medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: and experienced based spirituality
together when you're teaching people not
[SPEAKER_02]: only how to take care of their body with
breath, but also people who are interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in ceremonial plant medicine as part of
that health experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, tell us a little bit, if you would,
why smoking cannabis can be so spiritual
[SPEAKER_02]: with the right set and setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a friend of mine kind of introduced
me to this idea about speaking to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant itself, to Santa Maria, Mary Jane,
however you want to call her and
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizing that she's an ally,
that she's a teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that teaching, she will go through
many stages when you ingest her.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first rush of her and then
there's a long period of her enlivening
[SPEAKER_00]: you in some kind of spiritual body way and
then the piece that comes afterwards where
[SPEAKER_00]: you begin to come down from it and you
feel your tiredness and your end of your
[SPEAKER_00]: journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're thinking of it as a journey,
as a time period of ingesting an ally who
[SPEAKER_00]: is on board to wake up some part of your
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's mostly body consciousness,
but I also like when I am moving my body
[SPEAKER_00]: how it enlivens me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It enlivens my psyche and my spiritual
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, being conscious that it is an ally,
that's the best way I can say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many plants, like other plants,
are master teachers, but cannabis has its
[SPEAKER_00]: own textures and personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, really engaging with the personality
of the plant that you're ingesting allows
[SPEAKER_00]: it to enhance what you're wanting to bring
forward in that particular moment and
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains will do different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there again comes back to the
engagement and being intelligent about
[SPEAKER_00]: what am I using this for and what do I
hope to get out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me use the plant in a way that
will support that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I find interesting
is that we have an ability to look at our
[SPEAKER_02]: inhalation of the cannabis plant in very
specific analytical techniques now because
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got laboratories and microscopes and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, if you look back 10 or 20,000
years, early humans who were carrying this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant around with seeds around with them
from encampment to an encampment and
[SPEAKER_02]: selectively hybridizing just based on what
seeds they took with them, they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know the analytics like we do,
but they knew something moving and
[SPEAKER_02]: important was going on where during the
first set, you were talking about how the
[SPEAKER_02]: inhalation of cannabis makes us more aware
of our body and kind of expands our
[SPEAKER_02]: connectedness to the world around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for us, we can actually explain that
what's going on in the brain and what
[SPEAKER_02]: parts are being stimulated and we can look
at it with an MRI.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anthropologically, looking back that
far, it was much more filled with mystery
[SPEAKER_02]: and myth and storytelling and engaging
with gods and angels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever the religion of that part of the
world was, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that there is still a place
for that kind of experienced based
[SPEAKER_02]: spirituality in a modern world where
everything is so data and analytics heavy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one of the things that
cultures have been doing since the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of time is altering
consciousness, and that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're ingesting cannabis,
you're inviting an altering of
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness for perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I not see in normal consciousness
that I can see when I ingest cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: can inform how I live in my normal world?
[SPEAKER_00]: More in touch with my feeling part of my
reality than my thinking part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what magic shows up, not like magic as
something that's just a game, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: magic of the mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wow, I'm tuning into something
that I've never tuned into before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are doing ceremonial cannabis
evenings now where that is the focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I bring forward that I normally
don't talk about that I normally don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: that I need to process to help me feel
more multi-dimensional?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are living in a multi-dimensional
reality, and that's what the fear of it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the government is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want us to feel what else might
be out there that feels more human than
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, may we all tune in and get more
attention to the natural world and our own
[SPEAKER_02]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for being on this show,
Robert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your perspective is very unique,
and I appreciate it, and I'm glad that you
[SPEAKER_02]: were willing to join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure to be here,
and I enjoyed the conversation immensely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can connect with Robert Littman
through his website at TheBreathableBody
[SPEAKER_02]: .com, and there's a link there.

YouTube page.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just search Robert Littman,
and it'll come right up, because the
[SPEAKER_02]: videos there give some more exercises,
some more just general explanation of
[SPEAKER_02]: breathing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you tend to get your nasal passages
tend to be clogged up because you toke so
[SPEAKER_02]: often, there's a really great exercise
there for opening those up nearly
[SPEAKER_02]: instantaneously.
