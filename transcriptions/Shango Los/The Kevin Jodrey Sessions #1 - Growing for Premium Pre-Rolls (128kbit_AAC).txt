[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this is Shango from Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple weeks ago, I sat down with Kevin
Joudry and asked him a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: questions that I really wanted to know his
opinion on, but nobody else seemed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: asking him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is first in a series that you're
going to get, you know, over the next
[SPEAKER_01]: couple weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they cover the topics, you know,
cover everything from growing specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: for pre-rolls to choosing the quality of
terpenes to use in manufacturing your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products all the way through to
like, you know, snitching, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on with snitching in
California and even his mom on his
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook page and what's up with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, it's going to be a good series.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kevin, you know, when you were up
speaking on Vashon Island, you said this
[SPEAKER_01]: great thing in your lecture, and I wanted
to give you a chance to break it out a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that there is a particular way to
grow for pre-rolls, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And pre-rolls have taken off, but you were
very clear that there are types of strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want to use for pre-rolls and
definitely ones that you do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give you an opportunity to
break that out about how to choose your
[SPEAKER_01]: strains if they're going to end up in
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-rolls are a unique type of cannabis
delivery system because you've taken the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and you ground them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've oxidized them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've exposed them to oxygen,
which starts to break them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they're typically consumed in
that smokable form, you end up having a
[SPEAKER_00]: longer long cylinder of smoking material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cannabis that has a high
mono-terpene, very loosely molecularly
[SPEAKER_00]: bonded scent molecules, they're
outstanding for flower sales and for oil
[SPEAKER_00]: sales because the nose can pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you typically don't pick up those
smells through the rolling paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also very temperature
sensitive and the process of handling,
[SPEAKER_00]: grinding, exposing the air diminishes
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for pre-rolls, what you really want
to seek is a sesquiterpene dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one can even take a look now with all
the terp reports and find out which
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals have these high sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're doing sifting,
say, through a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say we're sifting through a lemon haze
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would go through the lemon haze line
and we would look to see which ones of
[SPEAKER_00]: these phenotypes that we're selecting,
our cultivars we're trying to select,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a higher sesquiterpene signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what that does is it has a much
higher heat resistance in its resiliency
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you start to consume the
pre-roll, the flavor in the front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: joint when you smoke it should be very
close to the same at the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a lot of the pre-roll products is
we get a hit that tastes okay and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is that it gives pre-rolls
a bad name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people who like to smoke joints,
they are typically rolling a flower fresh,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning they're breaking it up themselves,
they're preparing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get everything in this beautiful
package and when they buy something
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-prepared, it's diminished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, it's a lot simpler to just
find the right varietals that have a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher sesquiterpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good example would be the old Mendo
perps, the Urkel, the Barney, all those
[SPEAKER_00]: perps that were so resilient and they were
so popular because blunts at that time was
[SPEAKER_00]: such a in vogue form of smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have this large cylinder of
cannabis that you're burning so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: really a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mendo perp, the Urkel, had an ability
to hold the flavor all the way to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bitter end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it allowed people to enjoy the
experience the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we started to really look at
pre-rolls and how the market accepts it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that that's where we had to
focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're going to go do pre-rolls
and you're trying to get into that
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution, you might find that the
varieties you sold as flower aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily best for pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to kind of resift your
population and then use terp analysis to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you an idea which ones really have a
much higher level of sesquiterpene is
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily more bonded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clear that in the early days,
especially in medical, people would use
[SPEAKER_01]: their B and C stuff and put those in the
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they were going to be chewed up
and no one would see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now with so many more people involved,
the pre-roll game has gotten a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes a lot more sense to put maybe
not your super bag appeal A, but at least
[SPEAKER_01]: your A- stuff that's got sesquiterpene in
it so people can even taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tasting it down to the roach is a rare
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it also opens up another market of
things that aren't necessarily visually
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so flower market has to be beautiful
because people see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you grind it and turn it into a
product, no one has any idea what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so therefore, it allows you to pick
different varietals that really would
[SPEAKER_00]: shine in a pre-roll environment where you
get a lot of quantity of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a high sesquiterpene component.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bag appeal A plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows you to have some choices to
work with on your farm so you have more of
[SPEAKER_00]: a distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that what really happened,
too, is the consumer got educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so back in the day, you got whatever
you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go turn that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the right idea, though,
because it got hot in here fast as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: it closed the doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why this is such a tough room to
run plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never allowed us to make any changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on the regulatory gauntlet for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get back to the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The customer became educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so back in the day, you received
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from wherever it was from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you received cannabis from your
street dealer, and it was what they could
[SPEAKER_00]: grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got into the rise of
dispensaries, where you had an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of cannabis being grown everywhere,
constantly being brought into these
[SPEAKER_00]: storefronts that allowed tremendous
numbers of people to buy cannabis on a
[SPEAKER_00]: normal, consistent level that they could
examine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it educated them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't dump your low-end cannabis
into pre-rolls anymore, just as you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: dump any low-end cannabis into
concentrates because people have an
[SPEAKER_00]: expectation of flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't work to dump quality
products that should be in a bag into a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't make sense to take stuff
that should be in a pre-roll into a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once you see that, it allows you to
differentiate what you're working with on
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things that don't require the visual
beauty are a lot less labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it gives you some options in terms
of profitability, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for breaking that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
Thank you.
Thank you.
