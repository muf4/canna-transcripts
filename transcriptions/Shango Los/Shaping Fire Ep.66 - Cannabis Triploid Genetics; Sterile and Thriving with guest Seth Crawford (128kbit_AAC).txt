[SPEAKER_02]: As cannabis cultivation continues to
normalize across the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: more and more research and development is
being invested in cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our heritage growers made the cannabis
crosses we love today based on intuition
[SPEAKER_02]: and experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today though, a whole new variety of
cannabis breeder has evolved, not only
[SPEAKER_02]: using intuition and experience,
but also using heavy computing and
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory analytics as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: While there is certainly no replacement
for experience and intuition, technology
[SPEAKER_02]: assisted breeding greatly decreases the
time it takes to actually attain breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: goals because successful cultivars can be
analyzed and confirmed on the spot in a
[SPEAKER_02]: spreadsheet instead of having to grow all
the plants to maturity and having all the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder's friends smoke the flowers,
hoping to confirm the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: With analytical breeding, sex,
cannabinoid content, terpene content,
[SPEAKER_02]: and overall potency can be determined in
just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several thousand times over, making
extraordinarily large sifts a real
[SPEAKER_02]: possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: The application of these technologies does
not create genetically modified organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They simply allow traditional Mendelian
breeding decisions to occur much,
[SPEAKER_02]: much faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we're going to be talking about
triploid cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: These triploid plants are only available
to us due to the availability of computing
[SPEAKER_02]: power to cannabis breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants have three chromosomes
instead of two, which makes them sterile
[SPEAKER_02]: and impervious to unintentional
pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also exhibit other traits many
cultivators want, like increased yields
[SPEAKER_02]: and resistance to pests and molds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Triploids occur in nature in a great many
species, and in nearly all cases,
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants are superior to the other
plants in their species, so long as you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't intend to breed with them.

your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest today is Seth Crawford.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth is a deinstitutionalized academic
with a master's in public policy and a PhD
[SPEAKER_02]: in sociology.
[SPEAKER_02]: His focus up till now has been on the
political economy of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: For years now, he has been consulted by
lawmakers and policy specialists for a
[SPEAKER_02]: better understanding of how the cannabis
economy works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth is now co-founder of Oregon CBD
Seeds, a company researching, developing,
[SPEAKER_02]: and wholesaling specialty novel
cannabinoid dominant cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth appeared on episode 25 of Shaping
Fire to talk about the convoluted CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: market and again on episode 37 to discuss
the nexus of the medical cannabis and hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, we're going to talk about the
dramatic evolution of triploid seeds for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Seth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get right into it talking about
triploid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Triploids are really common in other
agriculture and food industries,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm figuring the place to start with
today would be if you were to start with
[SPEAKER_02]: the story of your entire valley getting
pollinated a few years back, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was definitely the impetus for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was back in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the second year of industrial hemp
production in the state of Oregon and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was the first year of legal adult use
outdoor production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the inaugural year for THC and the
first, I would say, big year for
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a neighbor who was about three
miles away from one of our facilities and
[SPEAKER_00]: six miles away from our major field who
had about 75 acres of densely planted male
[SPEAKER_00]: and female industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was supposed to be industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pollinated our field, our facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pollinated neighbors that were 15 miles
to the east, 15 miles to the north,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 miles to the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really demonstrated the viability of
cannabis pollen and just how far it can
[SPEAKER_00]: travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll grant him that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good science experiment,
but on the other hand, it devastated a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of other farmers in the valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, in ensuing years,
it continued to happen in smaller,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say it was to that scale,
but it's definitely been happening in our
[SPEAKER_00]: valley and then also throughout the state
and other areas, especially in southern
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really demonstrated to people
that even if you have good communication
[SPEAKER_00]: with your neighbors, there are just some
folks who cannot be convinced that their
[SPEAKER_00]: right to farm is less important than the
common good of everybody else being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a crop as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really an outgrowth of that
experience for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks who are listening to the show who
aren't super familiar with pollen,
[SPEAKER_02]: why don't you explain why it's lame that a
neighbor's crop pollinated your crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an all-female crop that you're
growing for cannabinoids, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, CBD, CBG, et cetera, or even just for
terpenes in cannabinoid-free plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: if those female plants end up being
pollinated, you're going to lose about 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: of your overall biomass and about 30% of
your total cannabinoid content just
[SPEAKER_00]: because the female plants are putting all
of their energy into that seed production
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than into the stuff that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very problematic from an economic
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, you're also ruining good
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a real human aspect to it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of this too, and it's going
to be a part of this larger story,
[SPEAKER_00]: is if you're a farmer and let's say you're
trying to grow a grain crop in the Midwest
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're trying to feed your cattle a
very particular type of grain,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot of cases that grain, while the
seed itself is highly impacted by the
[SPEAKER_00]: female that ends up producing the seed,
it's also impacted from Omega 3 and Omega
[SPEAKER_00]: 6 and then other components of the seed
that is healthy and good for nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be influenced by the pollen donor
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to have a pure type of
seed, even if it's just for your cattle,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen contamination can really play a
significant role in undermining that as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also in seed production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it's even more than just commercial
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the spirit of people who want
to guerrilla grow cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the cannabis be free.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make these little fertilizer balls
and they chuck them into vacant yards and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with that though is that if
you have these feral cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_02]: growing around, you could have a patient
who's got their little home grow with four
[SPEAKER_02]: or six plants or something and they are
growing their medicine and it's important
[SPEAKER_02]: and somebody has thrown some feral hemp a
few parcels down and one of those seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes a male and all of that pollen is
blowing windwardly to this patient's
[SPEAKER_02]: house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly, their medicine is going to get
all of this pollen and ruin this crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: which could be literally a life or death
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm constantly encouraging people to not
guerrilla garden irregular sexed seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's dangerous for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't imagine a worse punch in the
stomach than to have that small outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow that you put all that time and energy
into in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Oregon, it's four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to the end of the season and your
plants are finishing up and you realize,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh no, there's seed in all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically lose three to four months of
your life and all that time and energy you
[SPEAKER_00]: put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way, it's a lot like legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very beginning, before there was
any form of legal THC consumption in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States at the state level,
a lot of advocates would say, we just have
[SPEAKER_00]: to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: While yes, that's true, we need to
legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of legalization, once you
start to get into the weeds of policies
[SPEAKER_00]: and rules and how that gets implemented
becomes much, much more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the same thing is definitely true
in industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of folks that are big
advocates of hemp in general who have
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly criticized some of the farmers
over the last few years for growing CBD or
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabinoids and not putting energy
into fiber crops or grain crops and that
[SPEAKER_00]: type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that same question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp can do these amazing things,
however, how?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we make all of these different
uses coexist peacefully?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the biggest
challenges that we have in the 21st
[SPEAKER_00]: century of being able to adapt this crop
both to the landscape and to the social
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape of being able to have people
interact in a way that's not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: negative for either party.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about that quite a bit last time
you were here about how after your valley
[SPEAKER_02]: got pollinated, you tried to pull together
the local farmers to create what I called
[SPEAKER_02]: at the time a pollen exclusion zone for
lack of an official term.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that it was actually really
challenging because farmers are some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the most independently minded people that
there are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly with liberation minded folks and
to pull people together to agree to not do
[SPEAKER_02]: certain things on their property,
there's a lot of pushback.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we're going to talk
about today is why triploids are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this is going to be an
opportunity today where science is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to make the politics of living in your
neighborhood easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had tried from a policy perspective and
from a social perspective to try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: people to engage and agree and come
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't possible, but there's other
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the introduction to the show,
I mentioned vaguely what triploids are so
[SPEAKER_02]: people knew what they were in for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you are deep into polyploidy
science, why don't you go ahead and give
[SPEAKER_02]: us your definition of what a triploid is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would first couch this and say the
reason that we even have a polyploidy
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program here at Oregon CBD is
because we hired a recent PhD,
[SPEAKER_00]: Shen Chen, who is an absolute genius when
it comes to both plant breeding and for
[SPEAKER_00]: the manipulation of polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really the one that is the driving
force behind this at our company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Shen Chen and Brandon Rojas,
who works with Dr. Chen, are really the
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual weight behind this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just basically the communicator of
general science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triploids are... Cannabis is traditionally
a diploid species, which means that it has
[SPEAKER_00]: two sets of homologous chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It inherits one set from one parent and
the other set from its other parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless it's a self-pollinated plant,
in which case it is inheriting from that
[SPEAKER_00]: initial parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two copies of chromosomes are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you the opportunity if you have,
say, one bad gene or two good genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to basically have a fully
functional plant or a plant that ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: expressing things in a really profound
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triploids are plants that have three sets
of homologous chromosomes, which if two
[SPEAKER_00]: sets are good, three sets ought to be
really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get to that point, you have to have
tetraploid plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tetraploid would be a plant that has four
homologous sets of these chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I just described is diploid,
triploid, tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can continue going up the polyploid
scale and having more and more sets of
[SPEAKER_00]: homologous chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as you start to increase those
numbers, there tends to be basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping off of the positive impacts and
an increase of some of the negative
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges in ploidy breeding
is to identify at what level of ploidy
[SPEAKER_00]: does this particular species end up having
its maximum expression of health,
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor, vitality, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that these triploid plants were
like superhero plants with this extra
[SPEAKER_02]: chromosome really struck me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understood right off the bat that a
triploid was not going to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, it was not going to be impacted
by pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, cool, Seth, that's a great
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then as I researched the scientific
papers preparing for the interview today,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh my gosh, the list of
increased benefits to plants from
[SPEAKER_02]: triploid, it's really astonishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a short list of what I've picked up
from the science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pest and disease resistance, stem
straightness, increases in chloroplast
[SPEAKER_02]: number, which results in strengthening
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flowers of triploid plants are generally
larger and more colorful than those of
[SPEAKER_02]: their diploid counterparts because the
energy is devoted to, instead of seed
[SPEAKER_02]: formation, is used for flowers and other
organs, height and yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my God, it sounds like by adding
this third set of chromosomes that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: creating these super plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really what it comes down to, it's a
little bit more complicated than that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense that all of these things that
you're saying are 100% true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge for us has been to identify
which combinations of genes will result in
[SPEAKER_00]: the attainment of all of those wonderful
attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have seen is that in the same way
that you can take a specific combination
[SPEAKER_00]: and create incredible triploid plants,
you can also get the wrong combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: genes and create a plant that is,
I would say, less than a diploid in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of its ability to be very successful in
any given environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real challenge this summer has been
doing field trials to identify which of
[SPEAKER_00]: those crossing patterns are going to give
you the best results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just put my whole idea on its end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, you could get all of these
good variables in the plant, but you also
[SPEAKER_02]: could breed something that's especially
bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of reminds me of maybe with your
earlier breeding projects, you were trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to solve a Rubik's Cube, but now it's a
cube with 10 rows instead of just three
[SPEAKER_02]: rows or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're spot on with the metaphor.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you increase the ploidy, you begin to
increase the complexity of what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a plant that is as complicated as
cannabis, and up until very recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: so little known about the underlying
genomics, it was in a lot of ways a
[SPEAKER_00]: guessing game.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be perfectly honest, going into this
summer, we had ideas about what could work
[SPEAKER_00]: and what should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those did definitely have panned
out already, but others have been huge,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically had to go back to the
underlying data that we're able to luckily
[SPEAKER_00]: in-house generate using our whole genome
sequence equipment to produce these really
[SPEAKER_00]: high resolution genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can basically figure out, you've got
gene A and gene B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got two copies of gene A and one
copy of gene B, and you end up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that is 12 inches tall when it
finishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get one copy of gene A and two
copies of gene B, the inverse happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you end up with a five foot tall auto
flower plant that's yielding two and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half pounds of 20% CBDA flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really important to be able
to get those proper combinations mapped
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the tool that you use to figure
out the percentages of variability for all
[SPEAKER_02]: these traits showing up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm imagining that triploid makes breeding
squares cry, where you're figuring out
[SPEAKER_02]: what traits are going to be passed on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine that triploid makes that
very complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point, you want to just dump all
of these data points into a computer and
[SPEAKER_02]: say, okay, figure out of these genetics,
which ones are expressing which?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of them we have that are
advantageous, and which of these parents
[SPEAKER_02]: we actually want to bring together to
secure most of the traits that we want?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that simply dropping it into a
database, or what is the tool that you use
[SPEAKER_02]: to help move you ahead on that when the
variability is so mathematically high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about this before,
but my PhD is in sociology.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we have to do in
sociology is take very disparate amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: of data to try to explain a particular
social outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those situations, you'll come up with a
list of variables that are eight to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really explanatory variables that
have a big impact on your final outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll end up explaining, if you're
lucky, 30 to 40% of the total variation
[SPEAKER_00]: within any given population for any given
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the same thing is pretty accurate
when it comes to this particular crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a diploid plant, you're dealing with
over roughly 30,000 different genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the plant, and you have to deal
with different alleles and different
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of those in crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, obviously, is going to increase to
about 45,000 when you have a triploid
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tools that we use, the whole genome
sequence data is really useful,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the same time, we're also basically
in discovery mode, trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what each one of those genes are and what
they actually do in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical data is also really useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using genomic data, chemotype data,
and then the last leg of this in
[SPEAKER_00]: triangulating which crosses work the best
is just make the crosses and grow them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your phenotype data.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, I think we can create a broad
stroke, a broad outline of what could come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of a cross based on the underlying
genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a really good idea of what the
chemical data is going to look like based
[SPEAKER_00]: on those underlying genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual things that mean the most to us
outside of chemicals, the vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering time, the ability to deal
with plant stresses, drought, disease
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, et cetera, those things really
only show up when you're in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's field trials and growing them out and
just visually taking a look at each
[SPEAKER_00]: combination seems to be the best approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really can't do modern breeding
without all three.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using all three,
you're really just swinging in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably also keeps you a better
balanced person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of keeping you in the lab,
you have to put on your boots and go out
[SPEAKER_02]: into the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you want to be in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good excuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that is a remark in the
state of the science right now is with you
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to activate these different parts
of the genome to see what they do,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's as if we're still at a state of
science where there's still some intuition
[SPEAKER_02]: involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas a lot of other plant species where
triploids are very common and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: has become very mechanized and just
kicking out seeds, that science has
[SPEAKER_02]: already settled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the cannabis genome is still so
tasty and fresh that you've got your
[SPEAKER_02]: analytical equipment that helps you
quantify what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, since we're talking about real
world expressions that mean a lot in the
[SPEAKER_02]: field, it really takes for you to go out
and walk the plants, see the ones that
[SPEAKER_02]: strike your fancy, touch them,
feel them, smell them, and then go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the lab with that information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea that there's still some
analog left in this kind of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're able to nail down the science
side of it and you have a good data
[SPEAKER_00]: collection process going from the genomic
side, from the chemical side, and even on
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotype side, there really is an art
to the selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There always has been and I think there
always will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true in any type of breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in close contact with a lot of the
folks at the USDA ARS here in Corvallis
[SPEAKER_00]: and at the University at Oregon State
because we're part of this larger plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding community at this point now that
there's some acknowledgement that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a legitimate industry and it is having a
big impact on Oregon agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In farms across the country, at the end of
the day, there's always going to be art
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take berries, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a blackberry that has the right
sugar content and the right harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: ability and all the right variables,
all the boxes get ticked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, as a human,
if you have a fairly developed palate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can discern between a berry that has
just the right amount of sweetness versus
[SPEAKER_00]: a berry that's say overly sweet or under
sweet or whatever it happens to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where the beauty is at
because everybody has a different
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretation of what that ultimate is
going to be, what that perfect version is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leads to all of these different spaces
being available for different breeders to
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and make their mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we go to the first commercial
break, because I think we're all excited
[SPEAKER_02]: about set two where we're actually going
to talk about the science and how
[SPEAKER_02]: triploids are actually made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since this topic today is actually
triploids and not like a profile of your
[SPEAKER_02]: company, is there anybody else in the
cannabis industry who is working on
[SPEAKER_02]: triploids that we want to give a nod to as
also being a leader in this area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not commercially at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we are working with the
University of Connecticut, just as a sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of an informal research relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe we're a little further along in
our process and our breeding program than
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they are definitely, definitely
involved in doing some really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Jessica Lovell-Brand, I believe is
the professor there, her and her husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's two or three graduate
students who are working on projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some folks at Oregon State
University that are working on this as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of commercial adaptation of
triploids and being able to release them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confident that we're the only ones
right now in the world that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing triploids for 2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, you're going to be making a lot more
commercial seed buyers cry just like when
[SPEAKER_02]: you brought out your auto flowering CBD
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal, it's the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, you have to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not getting better at what
you're doing, then I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: questionable whether or not there's room
for you in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will start talking about how these
seeds are made after the break.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to take that short break now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is socio-ecologist,
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth Crawford.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you listen to Shaping Fire and you grow
your own cannabis, chances are high that
[SPEAKER_02]: you are very particular about the inputs
you use for growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like us painstakingly self-educate
on cannabis nutrients and techniques so we
[SPEAKER_02]: can cultivate the best tasting and
cleanest flowers possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we go to purchase those
nutrients, we want to be sure that our
[SPEAKER_02]: supplier shares our values and is
providing exceptional quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why I recommend build a soil dot
com to my friends who care about quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Build a soil empowers organic growers to
do their best work by sourcing and
[SPEAKER_02]: shipping only the finest cannabis growing
supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: From organic inputs, soils, soil testing,
and pots to lights, growing tents,
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayers, and cover crops, build a soil
founder, Jeremy Silva, doesn't just stock
[SPEAKER_02]: his store with what's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes deep to personally vet each
product for quality and determine that
[SPEAKER_02]: there isn't a better version of the
product that he could be selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of this arduous process,
you know that your options on build a soil
[SPEAKER_02]: dot com have been carefully curated to
create the results you are looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, but the build a soil way is
a philosophy that will permeate your
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction with the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: From website design to pricing and
shipping to after purchase support,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeremy and his team always strive to do
their best and give you the best customer
[SPEAKER_02]: service in the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out build a soil dot com today for
top tier quality cultivation supplies and
[SPEAKER_02]: a friends and family buying experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And check out their educational videos and
extraordinary social media while you're
[SPEAKER_02]: there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality organic growing supplies at build
a soil dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I love growing under the sun,
there's a lot of good reasons to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're like most folks,
you want a lighting source that grows high
[SPEAKER_02]: yielding, healthy plants without using
excessive amounts of electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: BIOS lighting creates biological lighting
solutions that brings the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: brilliance of the outdoors into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: BIOS lighting has the attributes that I
look for in a horticultural lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've bought those cheap lights online and
they're difficult to work with and fail in
[SPEAKER_02]: no time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In contrast, my BIOS LED light is
industrial grade to last a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is IP 66 wet rated so little foliar
overspray won't harm it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is easy to clean without taking it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course the most important aspect,
it is built for the exact light spectrum I
[SPEAKER_02]: want for great yielding, healthy cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't hurt that their lighting
rigs look bad ass too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many horticultural LED lighting systems
are based on irrelevant performance
[SPEAKER_02]: metrics and people love to argue online
about these numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to judge on par photon efficiency
and how happy my plants are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the BIOS lights exceed my expectations
in these categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: BIOS lights have an optimized broad
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_02]: plant growth while also providing the
ideal conditions for superior par efficacy
[SPEAKER_02]: and a comfortable visual experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also love their attentive and
overeducated customer service folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: BIOS starts with a team of biologists
before getting the electrical engineers
[SPEAKER_02]: involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have studied how light impacts
cannabis plants and devised an overall
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage you to check out their website
at bioslighting.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_02]: how this strategy can work for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shaping fire listeners can get a
special deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the discount code shaping fire,
all one word, no caps for 10% off your
[SPEAKER_02]: entire purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's bioslighting.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_02]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trouble with growing in new soils or
blended cocoa substrates is that it takes
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the plant's life just to create
these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's three times the concentration of
the current leading brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This new product called Dynomyco is the
result of 30 years of research and trials
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Volcani Agriculture Research
Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has also been vigorously tried by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: since the product first arrived here last
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have already even heard about
Dynomyco by its original name,
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Dynomyco is available at grow shops
and online in the United States for the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of mycelium networks in the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also as a biostimulant to make clone
cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco at
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco.com and find out where you can
get yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_02]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is socioecologist, Seth
[SPEAKER_02]: Crawford.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth, we got everybody all excited about
triploids during the first set because
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to make these superhero
chemovars that also can't be pollinated
[SPEAKER_02]: accidentally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the big question is,
how are they made?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there are people listening
that are saying, man, F that GMO stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start there by being really clear
that this is not genetically modified
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you go ahead and make a
clarification on the science so that
[SPEAKER_02]: people can be really clear that this is
actually nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not genetically modified
organisms.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually something that does
spontaneously happen in nature on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you maybe step back and take a look
at some of the most successful invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds that have propagated across the
country or across the world, many of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are tetraploids because of all of those
previous evolutionary advantages that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking about before in terms of
vigor and chloroplast count and efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: of using resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that in the long span of
history happens regularly and has actually
[SPEAKER_00]: given rise to most of the diploid species
that we've seen today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you end up seeing is a spontaneous
transition to say a tetraploid and then
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime in the future, you'll have a
halving again and you'll go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: diploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the reason that we see a lot
of the diversity in many different plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species is because of these go to
tetraploid, go back to diploid over these
[SPEAKER_00]: long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our program, we're taking plants that
have been very specifically bred for
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics that we felt were
important and are part of our previous
[SPEAKER_00]: diploid breeding program and now we're
bringing in what were new characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: and new traits in diploid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're putting them through
essentially a chemical transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking a diploid plant and doubling
its chromosomes not inserting anything
[SPEAKER_00]: new, but taking what's there and literally
just doubling it using chemicals in vitro
[SPEAKER_00]: and then having to grow those plants out
repeatedly, take cuttings, grow them out
[SPEAKER_00]: again, take cuttings, grow them out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: At every single one of these stages,
it's anywhere between six to eight months
[SPEAKER_00]: to make this happen from start to finish,
we have to test every single one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with a flow cytometer, which is a
very fancy piece of science equipment that
[SPEAKER_00]: is able to tell you the size of the
underlying genome of the plant that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having to screen to make sure that
these formerly diploid plants have been
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully transitioned to tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I think it's important
to point out is that while you use a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of technology in this sort of breeding,
the use of technology itself does not set
[SPEAKER_02]: it up for being GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I normally talk about it with
patients is that it's kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between technology between a
magnifying glass and a scalpel.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to a magnifying glass,
you're looking what is there and then with
[SPEAKER_02]: a scalpel, you are cutting and
rearranging.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of your technology that you're using
is essentially different forms of a
[SPEAKER_02]: magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are using analytics and testing and
gene mapping to see what there is so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can have a better grasp of what's
naturally in your plants so that when you
[SPEAKER_02]: have your plants naturally interact,
you get it right the first time-ish
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of just shooting from the hip
without knowing what's in your genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: makeup like most of us pollen chuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that's a fair
characterization?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most definitely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The magnifying glass versus scalpel is a
good metaphor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I usually describe it is
we're reading rather than writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our PacBio Sequel 2, it's a whole
genome sequencer that allows us to get
[SPEAKER_00]: every single A, T, G, and C that makes up
the entire basis of each one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: individual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to read all of those letters up
to 100 times to know with close to 100
[SPEAKER_00]: percent certainty, 99.99 percent is where
the accuracy is at now, what is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: in those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of these tetraploids,
you can liken it to a copy machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than making some big edits and
changing things, we're taking what's
[SPEAKER_00]: already there and just making an
additional copy of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had said before, that's where we
get into the nitty-gritty is being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out which of those genes are good,
which of those genes, when combined with
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves again, end up being bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, which of the plants in
these crosses, which one do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have two copies of the genome versus which
one do you want to have just one copy on
[SPEAKER_00]: the triploid crosses?
[SPEAKER_02]: This next question is probably going to be
dry for some folks, but I know that there
[SPEAKER_02]: are serious breeders listening who are
really going to be grateful that we took
[SPEAKER_02]: this extra step down this path.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I'd like you to do if you
would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you're saying that each of these
cycles in trying to tease out the
[SPEAKER_02]: attributes you want take six to eight
months, would you just give us a timeline
[SPEAKER_02]: of milestones on the creation of a
triploid chemovar?
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm imagining is you're like,
okay, we start with this, and then we do
[SPEAKER_02]: this, and then we do this a few times,
and then we end up with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I know that the breeders want
to be able to picture the process in their
[SPEAKER_02]: heads so they can wrap their heads around
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you go through that process for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We release F1s, which means that you have
to have two independently developed,
[SPEAKER_00]: highly inbred parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a pollen donor, one is a pollen
recipient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting to the point where you have
developed the two parent lines is roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: a three-year process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have explained it elsewhere over the
years, but you find a cross that you
[SPEAKER_00]: really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the attributes that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You inbreed that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the seeds off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find the best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You self-pollinate over and over and over
as many times as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: To lock in all of the traits that are
exactly what you're looking for in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of stabilization with that one variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simultaneously, you're doing exactly the
same process with a separate line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inbreeding, inbreeding, inbreeding,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing your selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of all this, four to five
generations down the road, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually bring them back together and
create your F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pollinate one highly inbred line with
another highly inbred line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That results in seeds that would actually
go into the farmer's hands and go into
[SPEAKER_00]: their fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than being highly inbred,
they're very heterozygous, which gives
[SPEAKER_00]: them hybrid vigor and allows them to
thrive in a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a three-year process.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add tetraploids to the mix to
make a triploid F1, you basically have to
[SPEAKER_00]: choose, and this is the important part,
choose which one of those parents you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to have the two copies donated to your
triploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identify which of those you want and then
go through the process of chemically
[SPEAKER_00]: transforming those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that basically from cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have hundreds of those
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them with the chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: A handful of them will survive and those
survivors end up being the tetraploids
[SPEAKER_00]: that then get cuttings taken off of them,
tested again, grown out, cuttings taken
[SPEAKER_00]: off of them again, tested, grown out,
and then if they pass all of those tests
[SPEAKER_00]: and remain tetraploids, then those plants
will end up going into our production
[SPEAKER_00]: environments to make the triploid seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really looking at what used to be,
if you were really pushing and doing your
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridization programs quickly,
and still giving yourself a year to do
[SPEAKER_00]: field trials, it's about a three-year
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at closer to four,
four and a half years from the time that
[SPEAKER_00]: we start a project until we can get seed
into a farmer's hands as a triploid F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I like the compactness of that
explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always nice to interview somebody who
was formerly a professor.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question for you though is,
so you started this project like five
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: The inbreeding to get to the point where
we had the diploid parents, we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on that this whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically where we're at right now is we
can take any of these parents that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: developed over the years and we're
continually developing obviously new
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: This upcoming year we're releasing CBDV
dominant plants and CBGV dominant plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: so new compounds altogether that allow
industrial hemp farmers to meet the super
[SPEAKER_00]: stringent USDA enforced 0.3% THC limit
even at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a fairly revolutionary
development for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got these plants- Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't need you to stop there for a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know all of these growers whose chins
just dropped?
[SPEAKER_02]: What you just said is like a bombshell.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got two brand new novel cannabinoids
that don't test hot at harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty big deal to just slide on
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's kind of big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just like one variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spent the last three years working
to completely remake our entire library.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the varieties that we've released over
the last couple years, suverhase,
[SPEAKER_00]: special sauce, lifter, et cetera,
et cetera, those have all been converted
[SPEAKER_00]: into these very rich triploid forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're releasing fully compliant,
fully infertile female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very rich triploid varieties for
2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I interrupted you, but essentially you
were saying that you can take any of these
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties that you've been bringing in the
market for the last few years,
[SPEAKER_02]: do this dance remix on them, and boom,
now they can be triploid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're taking stuff that you've already
proven and upgrading them essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I found interesting
is that when you're using these three sets
[SPEAKER_02]: of chromosomes, there are all of these
attributes, good and bad, that are
[SPEAKER_02]: bouncing around that you're trying to get
a handle on, but a lot of these are not
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They create imbalances like epigenetic
changes and genome size and increase and
[SPEAKER_02]: decrease genomic diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the imbalances that you
have seen are common in cannabis to come
[SPEAKER_02]: out when attempting to find a triploid
that's in balance?
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one thing that we're seeing is
that the process of inbreeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: while it does lock in very specific traits
that you target, it can also lock in
[SPEAKER_00]: deleterious alleles over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really problematic is that you
don't always see the full expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: the negativity that goes along with those
particular genes when there's only two
[SPEAKER_00]: copies, but they are coming out when
there's three copies on a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a variety that you've
worked over a long period of time to
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize and it seems to be hitting all
the marks that you want, but as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: you add one additional copy, then
everything goes haywire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's that accumulation of
negative alleles over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I could also see this being
problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very specific in flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we've been spending a
lot of time on the genomic side and just
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of data collection, being able to
catalog every possible permutation that's
[SPEAKER_00]: out there with these different flower time
genes and flower response genes that all
[SPEAKER_00]: end up working in concert together to end
up forcing a plant to go into flower at
[SPEAKER_00]: particular times.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really problematic with triploids
is that if you get, say, two copies of,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, the gene set that comes out
that goes along with, say, a haze plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: an old haze that is equatorial in origin,
two copies of that will, even when you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, say, a copy of an autoflower gene
also, you're going to end up with a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't finish flowering until
December.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's understanding which combinations end
up leading to the results that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us right now, that is identifying
different flowering genes that allow you
[SPEAKER_00]: to have staggered harvests from,
say, early August all the way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of October, depending on the bio
region that you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really being able to nail that down is
critical, but it's also probably one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most problematic areas, I think,
or it will be a problematic area as folks
[SPEAKER_00]: get into triploid breeding, just
understanding what those genes are and how
[SPEAKER_00]: those gene networks interact when you
increase ploidy.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're using this at a commercial
level and you're using thousands of seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: that becomes really important for the
simple reason if you think about
[SPEAKER_02]: succession planting in your home garden,
your food garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're planting lettuces and things that
grow quickly, sometimes once a week,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe every other week.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea is that so you get lettuce all
through the summer and you don't just get
[SPEAKER_02]: a hell of a lot of lettuce just one week.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a lot of commercial folks,
they don't want to have to harvest all of
[SPEAKER_02]: their acreage all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll plant some and then a little
longer later, they'll plant some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: That succession planting only really works
if those seeds are locked in to go from
[SPEAKER_02]: germination to being finished in a set
number of days, say 90 days, so that if
[SPEAKER_02]: you sow seeds a week apart, you know that
they'll be ready to harvest a week apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can imagine that is probably why you put
so much focus on that because if that
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't work, then this doesn't work at
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about non-psychoactive
cannabis farming, you really are talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are smaller farms and it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are doing everything that we can to
support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the biomass side, there are really,
really large farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a plant breeder, you're standing naked
before the world when you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand acres of your seeds in a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any type of hiccup in terms of
that flower response time, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear about it and the farmer is not going
to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, if farmers aren't successful,
then we haven't done our job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unsuccessful farmers are nasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to make sure you do your job well
so that they're not coming with pitchforks
[SPEAKER_02]: and fire torches and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll save that for the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit more about some of
the challenges when making triploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Albinism is pretty common when making
triploids and that would be no
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those die pretty quickly because of a lack
of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you seeing that pop up with working
with the cannabis genome because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: entirely possible that albinism is more
just common in other species?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see that, but we have not seen a
heightened expression in triploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the case even on, say, the poorly
performing inbred varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has not popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a field of hundreds of thousands of
plants, you're definitely going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen it in certain crosses in field
trials in previous years with diploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a high frequency, but it's
definitely something to be concerned with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flip side of that though, I would say,
is that if you can lock that trade in,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those plants that either have
albino expressions or have significant
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme variegation or say even a leaf
shape change that is becoming very popular
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, you can make those express in
particular ways that would be fantastic
[SPEAKER_00]: for say like a home garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's challenges for large scale field
production for say cannabinoids or fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: for food, but there's also some really
unique opportunities from just a home
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening ornamental plant standpoint that
we haven't seen with cannabis before,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's a non sequitur for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've had at least one or two albino
cannabis plants through all your trials,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love for you to compare and
contrast what you saw as an albino plant
[SPEAKER_02]: versus very often we will see indoor
plants, a photograph posted to Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: or similar, and there's always the ensuing
fight in the thread below arguing whether
[SPEAKER_02]: or not this is an albino plant or whether
or not this is a plant that was bleached
[SPEAKER_02]: by being too close to an LED light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so visually, I'm assuming you've seen
these photos too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So compare that, those stark white plants
that were grown under LEDs, is that how a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis albino presents itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know some species look more pink
and some look more white.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that I can know
scientifically true that I have seen an
[SPEAKER_02]: albino.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been someone showing me a
picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does an albino cannabis plant
actually present as?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really interesting is that it very
rarely will it actually encompass the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: More often than not, you'll get a sport,
a side shoot, or say half of the really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting ones are a shoot that half of
the shoot is green and half of the shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: is white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are pretty good examples of partial
albinoism.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that you're seeing on the
internet, if the top of the flower is a
[SPEAKER_00]: half an inch from the LED and the only
thing that's white on the plant is that
[SPEAKER_00]: bleached out spot, pretty good indication
that it's from the light rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic abnormality.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that's really cool
about, especially the variegated plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that have a tendency towards albinoism,
is two years ago we found a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: example of this in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric, in his infinite wisdom, dug it up
and I'm like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we spending this time to dig this
plant up?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he digs it up, puts it in a pot,
and we took it back to our other farm and
[SPEAKER_00]: just stuck it in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had this idea that if you just take
that plant, get it out of the direct sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it in the shade, it would actually
start to put chlorophyll back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lo and behold, that's exactly what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially what you've got is a plant
that thrives in shade-grown conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than a plant that's thriving in
these high-intensity solar radiation in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it lends itself to the explanation
of just how plastic this cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a different environment,
it would thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for field production, it may not
necessarily be the best case.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a side note, I have been really
enjoying seeing all these atypical
[SPEAKER_02]: morphologies of cannabis have their heyday
as there's more people breeding and more
[SPEAKER_02]: people being able to share and feeling
free to share their photographs on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing lots more pictures of
variegation and the ensuing argument about
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not it's variegation or whether
it's mosaic or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of that, but it's cool to
see people sharing pictures of variegated
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that historically, we haven't been
able to see because everybody is seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: these in hiding during the prohibition
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then of course, the freak show plant that
has got everybody tantalized for the last
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of years, it looks more like a
tomato plant than like a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then of course, the newly arrived
Australian bastard genetic line,
[SPEAKER_02]: that again, looks like a fern of some sort
instead of a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these different morphologies,
I never thought there was a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's these interesting plants to
grow and experiment with for people who
[SPEAKER_02]: just love the cannabis plant itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, and maybe never,
they will never be production level
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really like my freak show that's on
my desk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, it looks super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in previous years, if you're
capped with a certain number of plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to obviously want to call the
individuals that are not going to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, that was cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, everything is a little bit laxer and
people are starting to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of not only the medicine,
but also the food and the fiber and quite
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, the fundamental beauty of a
unique individual from a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire ornamental plant breeding
industry is built on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to probably start
seeing ornamental cannabis plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: people's yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be able to tell that it's a
cannabis plant anymore, but I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the fun and the beauty and the
plasticity of this awesome species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be nice to be able to
grow the plant for the joy of gardening
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of feeling like you have to do it
in prohibition mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: To a certain degree, I'm asking this next
question just because I want to get this
[SPEAKER_02]: phrase into the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this thing called mixoploid
chimera.
[SPEAKER_02]: A mixoploid chimera happens sometimes when
breeding triploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Its definition is an inconsistent ploidy
from one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, I'm picturing that instead of
the breeding process kicking out all
[SPEAKER_02]: triploid seeds, it's actually kicking out
seeds that have got different numbers of
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics in them, different numbers of
sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resulting seed stock is going to be
not comprehensively ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't be the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: How hard is it when you are ramping up the
scale after you've done this long arduous
[SPEAKER_02]: process that you've already described to
get the plant that you actually want?
[SPEAKER_02]: How challenging is it to then make tens of
thousands or more of these triploid seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that are all exactly the same so you get
the success in the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer comes down to just repeated
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though, as I described before,
you take a significant amount of time to
[SPEAKER_00]: test and test and test over and over using
the flow cytometer to establish that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have tetraploids and you have diploids in
your breeding population, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets even more complicated with what
we're having to do for 2021, which is also
[SPEAKER_00]: making these varan-rich plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the process, it means that every single
pollen donor that goes into one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses has to be individually tested
both for its ploidy and for its varan
[SPEAKER_00]: content to ensure that we've got
everything that we're looking for in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of being able to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say 100% uniform on the seeds
because they're still is variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they are hitting all the marks
for the traits that we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is to actually get to a
plant that is 100% uniform would require a
[SPEAKER_00]: different type of ploidy induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than increasing the ploidy level,
you decrease it to a haploid level where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only one chromosome, one set of,
excuse me, a single chromosome from the
[SPEAKER_00]: parent, from the donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be an individual haploid that
could then be chemically altered to have
[SPEAKER_00]: two sets, two copies of those same
chromosomes, but they're identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you end up being able to
produce, they're called doubled haploids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are essentially seeds that act just
like a clone would, but come along with
[SPEAKER_00]: all the benefits of seed vigor and having
no diseases, no pests, that sort of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: on the clone itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a gold standard right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, I know there are other
groups that are working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a research contract with Oregon
State University working on this just to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out if it's viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the long term, and it's an
interesting area for me because what you
[SPEAKER_00]: just described in saying your triploids
are uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're uniform to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very interested in maintaining some
diversity within these different genotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure that if there is some kind of,
if you have some sort of environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: problem or you have a pest pressure,
you really do need to have a certain level
[SPEAKER_00]: of diversity even in your seed crop that's
in a field to be able to handle those
[SPEAKER_00]: types of pressures and to identify certain
genotypes or certain phenotypes that can
[SPEAKER_00]: withstand those types of pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that idea of trying to get
towards a monoculture crop in the sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: maximizing your productivity of acres
while at the same time balancing that with
[SPEAKER_00]: the necessity to not have a monoculture in
your field, having enough diversity to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to respond to short-term pressures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's dig a little bit more into that
uniformity question because one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest aspects of uniformity in cannabis
that's important is with feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: because it doesn't take many sneaker males
to ruin a crop of otherwise female plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're adding another variable that really
must be at, if not 100%, really damn near
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% like we are with feminized seeds,
this fact that the seeds won't pollinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: How uniform are these triploid seeds that
are being produced in their uniformity and
[SPEAKER_02]: they are pollen impervious?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two questions all bottled up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is what sort of feminization rate are
we seeing with these triploids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it comparable to the diploids?
[SPEAKER_00]: With our diploids, it's 99.98%.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in 4,000 roughly would end up having a
male phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the triploids, we're seeing exactly the
same numbers, which is super interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dig into that a little bit
deeper on the genomic side to get a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of it is, given a triploid
plant exposed to pollen, how seed-free is
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're saying is that it is nearly
seed-free in the sense that last summer we
[SPEAKER_00]: had an experiment in a sealed greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 7,000 square foot sealed
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: No air coming in, no air going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: No air going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we had a triploid that was
pollinated by, I believe we had 300
[SPEAKER_00]: different pollen donors that had all been
reversed and they're making copious
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk into that greenhouse and you
would get sick if you're allergic to
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The triploids that were in that greenhouse
produced, one produced I believe four
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and another one produced I believe
five, which we were comparing it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: diploid sisters right next to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants were fully seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a weight comparison, you're looking at
about one four thousandth, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting part about that too is
that the seeds that come off of those
[SPEAKER_00]: triploids are actually non-viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would end up with, like I said,
four to five seeds per plant in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse that is completely inundated,
like inches of pollen on the benches when
[SPEAKER_00]: we were all done at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're highly, highly resistant to
pollen, which is really, really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting because not only are you
protecting your neighbors from your own
[SPEAKER_00]: crop if you're planting all female seeds,
you're already doing the right thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now you're basically guaranteed you're
not going to pollinate your neighbors
[SPEAKER_00]: because the pollen coming off of those
triploid plants are also non-viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no risk to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to self-pollinate because
honestly the plants don't have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a win-win and they are very,
very difficult to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting too that it's not simply
an on or off switch where the triploids
[SPEAKER_02]: that did produce seeds, it wasn't like,
oh yeah, these produce seeds and now
[SPEAKER_02]: they're full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh yeah, the plant produced
seeds, but it's only like three or four.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means that even though some of the
individual flowers failed, if you will,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be pollen resistant, it wasn't the
plant as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's multiple layers of threshold there
to resist the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we'd said earlier, they're super
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really interesting to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and take our second break
here and when we come back, we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about some of the applications of
triploids and where this is going to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is socio-ecologist, Seth
[SPEAKER_02]: Crawford.
[SPEAKER_02]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a replacement for using peat
[SPEAKER_02]: moss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_02]: container growing, but organic growers
know that peat moss is an unsustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: resource and the mining of peat bogs
destroys habitat and releases sequestered
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now there's finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that shares the
[SPEAKER_02]: same benefits while also being
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystems, it actually is made from
upcycled organic paper and tree bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_02]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption, and water
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades-long
[SPEAKER_02]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat
moss and handles exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like peat moss, pit moss is inert,
so it won't change your pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Available in a range of preparations,
including a nutrient-enhanced blend,
[SPEAKER_02]: a coco coir blend, and also as an organic
soil conditioner with no added nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding.

[SPEAKER_02]: For many, transitioning to organic
gardening can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much to learn about soil
biology and fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bioflux Fermented Plant Boost from
Everflux simplifies organic farming so you
[SPEAKER_02]: can start growing organically today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Invented by a California farmer growing
organic for 40 years, Bioflux is a
[SPEAKER_02]: fermented natural farming preparation for
those who want a natural micro booster
[SPEAKER_02]: without having to brew their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: This extraordinary chemical-free growth

[SPEAKER_02]: development, accelerates the conversion of
organic matter into humus, increases
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient use efficiency and uptake,
and increases beneficial microbe activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to the Bioflux Fermented Plant
Booster, Everflux also makes an activated
[SPEAKER_02]: biochar called Teroflux that is infused
with the Bioflux Plant Booster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine combining the buffering and
rhizosphere-enhancing qualities of biochar
[SPEAKER_02]: infused with a range of earthworm
castings, insect frass, kelp, and crab
[SPEAKER_02]: meal, oyster shell, and other ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using Teroflux-infused biochar this
summer myself, and it smells alive,
[SPEAKER_02]: rich, and potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: These products have been scientifically
proven to match yields and increase flower
[SPEAKER_02]: quality and pest resistance when compared
to traditional NPK inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are looking for reliable organic
fertilizers that will free you up to focus

Shango sent you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is socio-ecologist, Seth
[SPEAKER_02]: Crawford.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Seth, we've talked about what
triploids are and how they're made.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, this conversation brings up
all sorts of, like, interesting side
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in this third set, let's hit a
bunch of those side questions and start
[SPEAKER_02]: with, you know, it is possible that most
people who are not breeding are gonna want
[SPEAKER_02]: these seeds as well, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This idea that they can be, you know,
super plants showing all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible triploid, you know,
expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, me, as just a simple patient home
grower, I want to grow this stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though I'm not growing acres of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are these, you know, is anybody doing
triploids that are THC dominant,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just other novel cannabinoids at
this point, which are being designed for
[SPEAKER_02]: the medical hemp market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every home grower, once they have
grown a triploid, I don't think you will
[SPEAKER_00]: ever grow a diploid again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some fighting words.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a betting person, but I would
definitely wager in that camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really good papers, scientific
papers describing the differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: a triploid hop versus a diploid hop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar families in what you're
seeing is essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the terpenes and the other olfactory
components that make up the flavor profile
[SPEAKER_00]: of a hop are more than double in a
triploid versus a diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing is true in the triploid
cannabis plants that we're creating right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've never smelled a plant that had a
stronger flavor than these triploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversely, they're also producing more
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up with a plant that's,
I mean, it's basically the ultimate
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of what a cannabis plant can
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer your question in short,
no, unfortunately, there are not triploid
[SPEAKER_00]: versions of THC plants that are available
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would not surprise me if there are
a bunch of folks who are claiming that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have them after people hear about
this because they are just so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we are working on
is, you know, obviously, we're an
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp seed research and
development company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to honor the federal rules and
the USDA's guidelines on who we can give
[SPEAKER_00]: seed to and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that we are pushing very
hard at the federal level to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer seeds to home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to be able to do that
in Oregon for 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to work it out nationally at
this point for others to participate in
[SPEAKER_00]: that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that as part of the
research and development process,
[SPEAKER_00]: we end up with a lot of plants that are
considered type ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type one are high THC plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we also have type two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something to think about from
a gene stacking perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a type two plant that has an
active CBD and an active THC gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: what does that look like in terms of the
underlying ratio when you have three
[SPEAKER_00]: potential copies?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can stack these in different ways
to achieve very different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely working on making sure
that we have tetraploid versions of many
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very famous and useful THC plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're allowed to keep those as part of our
genetic library, but we're not allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would they would not meet the
obviously not meet the industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we can do the transformations on
site at our company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because we live in Oregon,
you know, we take these plants home and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can we can make seed with them and make
make triploid seed, you know, say in your
[SPEAKER_00]: basement or your garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing commercial quantities of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not legally allowed to sell them
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're definitely out there and they
are definitely awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so if I understand this correctly,
you can develop the genetics legally in
[SPEAKER_02]: your hemp company.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because though that is not a viable
product under your license, you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: stop there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if theoretically the laws were to
change and and hemp breeding hemp seed
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturers were able to now produce
type ones, you actually have got a library
[SPEAKER_02]: of this seed that you'd go, oh,
we're just going to put this into
[SPEAKER_02]: production now, even though they're
they're kind of it's like it's like spin
[SPEAKER_02]: off technology from the work that you're
actually trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very nice way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are basically just in a holding pattern
waiting for federal legalization to open
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're we're cannabis breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the underlying chemical compounds are
very, very simple targets in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the rest of it that interests us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, as as good plant breeders,
we're always keeping our work backed up
[SPEAKER_00]: and are always ready to move forward when
the time is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so let's say that you did, you know,
take one of these these type one seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that's triploid and you take it home and
and you make that your patient garden and
[SPEAKER_02]: you grow it and everything's all nice and
legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is are the differences between a triploid
and a diploid seed growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it so remarkable that you can tell that
as the you know, assuming that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: some experience growing hemp, cannabis
plants right already, like if I grew this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, would I be like, holy hell,
this is a different kind of plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it like, yeah, you know,
yeah, it's a better seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how remarkable is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in terms of say like olfactory
components, you know, not just terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know now that terpenes make up about 50
percent of what actually smells in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of them are different forms of
alcohols and especially aldehydes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The triploid plants tend to have anywhere
between 30 to 50 percent increased
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of those particular compounds,
which means that they are the loudest
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers that you that you're going to that
you're going to end up smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as an example, we've got one of my
favorite plants of all time is ChemDog
[SPEAKER_00]: number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of the ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ChemDogD, Chem91 and Chem4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem4 has always been my personal
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: In diploid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you see it in tetraploid form,
it's a whole other animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same smell, same giant flowers,
same great structure, same over the top
[SPEAKER_00]: resin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the smell and the trichome content on
it, when you look at it under a microscope
[SPEAKER_00]: or even just, you know, a loop,
a jeweler's loop, unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the concentration is incredible and
the smell is just overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can you can take that and then say
like in the case of Chem4, you can cross
[SPEAKER_00]: it with something else that has a
completely different flavor profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: say like a train rack with a turpentine
dominant expression and then end up
[SPEAKER_00]: creating this new flavor profile that is
not only incredibly intense in a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, you know, really, really vigorous,
but it's it's completely unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an expression that has never been
seen before because those two types of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes don't end up lining up when
you're when you're making crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really opens up the possibility,
not only of having a more vigorous plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with higher yields and better oil,
but also just increasing that total amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of diversity that's present.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's pretty sexy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should we should have started the show
with that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have kept a lot longer who we
lost because of the science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's that's really exciting to be
able to try these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must have been flabbergasted because
like, you know, I know you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you're a breeder and a professor
and and a business person, but like you're
[SPEAKER_02]: also a toker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flavored cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must have been blown away to see to
experience cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem four as your own triploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're basically doing that process
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a shout out to CSI Humboldt and
Caleb's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following his work for a number
of years and I've just always appreciated
[SPEAKER_00]: his level of detail when when hunting for
different phenotypes and making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: things are quote unquote real.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a lot of work making s ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking these really famous plants,
these famous cuttings, self pollinating
[SPEAKER_00]: them and then offering the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a plant breeder sifting through s
ones is where a lot of the magic really
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to lock in the traits that you
really want and get unique flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a lot of the THC varieties that I
personally work with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's not a cutting or something that's
been shared by other people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community, we're going to seeds from
reputable reputable underground breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: who continue to stay underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that who are making these
s ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of famous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got things like Durban poison,
California orange, train rack,
[SPEAKER_00]: purple oracle, you know, all of these
different s one varieties that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're now basically sifting through
figuring out which ones have exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking for both on a genomic
standpoint and then from the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to make tetraploids
out of them and basically be ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: 2022 when we're hoping that federal
legalization happens and everybody in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world can taste these flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also love Caleb's s one packs like,
you know, people will put out reg seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and call it a breeder's pack and you know,
it'll just have more seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get more, more phenos at a good
price.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, Caleb's s one packs are like
the gold standard as far as breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: packs, you know, there's so much variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he describes that he was actually on
shaping fire episode 49 talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's all like, you know, these,
these s one seeds, if you have enough of
[SPEAKER_02]: them, you kind of have a, a snapshot of
what is possible, you know, in that line
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's, it's, it's actually a
lot of credit to Caleb as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just mentioned him as somebody that
you respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a couple of weeks ago, we had Ryan Lee
on the show and he mentioned out of
[SPEAKER_02]: nowhere that he respect Caleb inspector
from CSI Humboldt as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, that, that,
that's a lot of, that's a got a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: good love for a guy who, you know,
mostly tries to stay in the underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel bad just for bringing his name
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but, you know, he, he's not in
the shadows.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just, he's just happy to stay small
and local to humble, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, and it's one of those things
where he's actually doing a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: service to other breeders by being able
to, to take these, these famous clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: not just you know, reverse them and make
seed, but he's actually doing the due
[SPEAKER_00]: diligence to make sure that it is what it
is and verifying that to the best of his
[SPEAKER_00]: ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think anybody's ability at this
point, but then also making something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it used to be that we would
ship clones around the country in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, DVD cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was how the underground stayed
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how we shared cuttings with each
other and, and made sure that there was
[SPEAKER_00]: not only, you know, cannabis plants across
the country and you had sour diesel and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in New York and in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a way of basically creating
culture and comradery with people who were
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the same type of risks that you
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been living that and also making
these, these seeds available from a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get an S one of say train rack,
if it's, you know, a legitimate cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in this case it is, you have all of
the possible permutations of that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular variety in seed form available
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's an S one, you're actually
getting expressions of both of the parents
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can start to sift through that and
figure out, well, what was it that made
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular plant, the original train
rack, so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, we're doing it from a chemical
antigenomic standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting to, to be able to have that
as an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exciting to be alive at this
moment at a time, being able to subject
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these classic flavors, these
classic varieties to really unprecedented,
[SPEAKER_02]: unprecedented analytical capabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: This summer, actually, we got a couple of
the Skittles S ones from Caleb here on
[SPEAKER_02]: Vashon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just opened the packs and we spread
them around different patients on the
[SPEAKER_02]: island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we, we spread them around
before the pandemic got more serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea that we were going to do was
that everybody was going to grow different
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds from the S one pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we were going to do kind of like
a progressive, you know, wander your way
[SPEAKER_02]: around the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and check out everybody's
gardens and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to have to do that
somehow more creatively with masks and
[SPEAKER_02]: crap this year now, but it's really
enjoyable, you know, for anybody who loves
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant to check out these S ones where
you're all like, Oh yeah, these are all
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see and smell that, but they all
have got, you know, subtly different
[SPEAKER_02]: personalities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if you're a nerd for the
plant, that's just a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I would love to go along on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's not going to happen
this year, but man, what a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you're probably going to
appreciate it more next year because we
[SPEAKER_02]: also got some of the, the chem dog S ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what we're planning on doing
next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so let's talk about something that is
really a theoretical, because we'll talk
[SPEAKER_02]: more about, you know, licensing issues
here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I know that the way that
you're seeds have to be sold, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: due to the government regulations is you
need to, you know, you need to sell to
[SPEAKER_02]: particular farmers and you can't just sell
to the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but, but as we know, you know,
occasionally some of those seeds will find
[SPEAKER_02]: their way into like, you know,
a friend of a farmer's hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would happen if, if a, if a,
if a, if a, you know, a home grower tried
[SPEAKER_02]: to replicate these triploids, you know,
some pollen chucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is it like a pollinating a triploid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like they, you know, like they,
well, essentially like people were doing
[SPEAKER_02]: with your other auto flower CBD seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your auto flower CBD seeds would be put
into the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, you know, the farmer who bought
them from you, isn't supposed to share
[SPEAKER_02]: them yet somehow miraculously their
neighbor gets some and, and they hit them
[SPEAKER_02]: with pollen in the basement to try to keep
going on the triploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the unfortunate for the folks that
are trying that, um, you're going to waste
[SPEAKER_00]: your pollen, uh, just because the flowers
are non-viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the whole point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you know, we're not doing it to,
to stop people from breeding with our
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're, we're trying to help farmers
from being, you know, cross contaminated
[SPEAKER_00]: by a neighbor that's not being wise in
their planting decisions or even,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for a farmer that's,
uh, say planting near a feral population
[SPEAKER_00]: of hemp, like we see all over the Midwest,
you know, basically from, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Southern United States all the way to,
to Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, you're, you're just not going to
end up with anything except, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably increased allergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, you know, you have viable
pollen in your basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the future of triploids look
like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we've established that we can do a
lot more with three sets of chromosomes
[SPEAKER_02]: than we can with two, and we're just
putting our big toe in the pool of
[SPEAKER_02]: triploids in cannabis and where we're,
you know, where you're starting is for it
[SPEAKER_02]: to be pollen resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you're going for,
you know, yield and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pest resistance and drought resistance and
such.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that there are a lot other
traits that can be toyed with,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, but just aren't going to be in,
you know, the first rev of, of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what do you expect us to see coming
from triploids, you know, over the next
[SPEAKER_02]: few years?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, to be perfectly honest,
outside of different flavor combinations
[SPEAKER_00]: that have never been seen, like I was
describing before, uh, in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: these new cannabinoid profiles,
um, you know, your flowering time,
[SPEAKER_00]: disease resistance, that those big things
that you'd already mentioned, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm really just scraping the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, at every single week,
we're getting another four whole genomes
[SPEAKER_00]: sequenced and assembled in, uh,
you know, available for us to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, basically start digging through and
mining, uh, trying to figure out which of
[SPEAKER_00]: these different genes are contributing to
different aspects of the plant that could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I think in the, in the longer term,
the way that I view this, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a specific answer,
but I think in the longer term,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're seeing is that these plants are
going to have the capability of having
[SPEAKER_00]: greater evolutionary adaptability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is a, you can go back to the
notion of punctuated equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the specific concept of evolution and
how it operates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was put forward by Stephen James J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gould, one of the most brilliant 20th
century evolutionary biologists,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, notion that over long historical
periods, you end up with essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: stasis, not a lot of change that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in specific moments, you have
what's called punctuated equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equilibrium is punctuated by,
uh, either external events that end up
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging a particular organism,
uh, an organism survival or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is localized, say in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, uh, you know, predators coming in and
eating the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here is that the more,
uh, adaptability that a particular species
[SPEAKER_00]: has, uh, for any of these particular
challenges, the more fit it is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we see, you know, the ravages of
climate change or, uh, issues with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, weeds in, in fields or,
you know, some of the larger ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: pressures that, that are undoubtedly going
to be coming down on us in the 21st
[SPEAKER_00]: century, these plants have the capability
of responding to that in a way that we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't even foresee at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it also sounds like it's a real
open ended kind of answer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the answer is, um, we don't know what
might still be in these plants because
[SPEAKER_02]: we're still learning the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we're not sure what we're going
to need them to do yet because our,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, as our, as, as climate change
continues, we're not sure how it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to manifest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like a, you know,
a big open ended question, which actually
[SPEAKER_02]: makes me feel really like enthusiastic
for, you know, the, the, the, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, the, the, the future
geneticists and probably even more so the
[SPEAKER_02]: pot smokers that are in college right now
who are studying these sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great time to be a, you know,
18, 19, 21 year old, something like that
[SPEAKER_02]: in school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you're able to actually study this
in the classroom, get into a lab and then
[SPEAKER_02]: find yourself matriculating out of school
and go into legit companies that are
[SPEAKER_02]: working like this and have this be your
life's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how bad ass is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great time to be coming into your
career in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only got here because I,
I, you know, basically got let go from the
[SPEAKER_00]: university for being a proponent of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm incredibly thankful to be in the
position that I'm at, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the younger folks that we have in our
company right now who are recent
[SPEAKER_00]: graduates, you know, with horticulture
degrees or botany degrees or plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding degrees, they, they have a really
hard time keeping a smile off of their
[SPEAKER_00]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause this is like, this is the moment in
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this golden age of cannabis breeding
and discovery that, you know, you really
[SPEAKER_00]: only get to be around one time,
you know, as it's happening and it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing that may be worthwhile
noting is this idea that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the problems that the Midwest has,
I brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to have a triploid because you
can't be pollinated by the feral
[SPEAKER_00]: populations that are left over from,
you know, fiber farming in the first part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: These native populations have established
themselves and basically continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive because it's a fairly adaptable and
plastic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways that we can end up dealing
with that, I think over time, it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger concern here in Oregon where,
you know, you had a huge explosion of
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp farms where people were
using male and female seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately, and then basically just
leaving the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't let, you know, we're seeing it
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fields all over in the Willamette
Valley and in Southern Oregon where the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers farmed last year, didn't take care
of their crop and they're gone now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the seeds remain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have male and female
populations popping up, creating a feral
[SPEAKER_00]: population where there never was one
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very, very difficult thing to
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we're working on is
being able to use tetraploids and diploids
[SPEAKER_00]: in rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically grow your tetraploids for
four or five years in a specific area and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can switch back to a diploid to
make sure that you don't have feral
[SPEAKER_00]: populations that pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the ploidy to your advantage
to basically stop feral populations from
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging.
[SPEAKER_02]: That reminds me a lot of those mosquitoes
that are in the news right now where they
[SPEAKER_02]: GMO'd up some mosquitoes that don't breed
and they're introducing them to the
[SPEAKER_02]: population.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the mosquitoes are breeding with
sterile other mosquitoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though we're talking about
triploids, which are not GMO, we will
[SPEAKER_02]: repeat, the idea is kind of the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're talking about, this feral
reduction, because it will stop them from
[SPEAKER_02]: producing usable seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, just to highlight that,
not GMO, we're taking something that
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just we didn't know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be perfectly honest, I bet there
are people who are growing cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_00]: right now in their basement, in their
garage, in their closet that are
[SPEAKER_00]: tetraploid and they just don't know it
because these plants do pop up naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: in populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just very, very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people don't have a $40,000 piece
of science equipment to be able to test in
[SPEAKER_00]: their home whether or not it's a
tetraploid or a diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically using this new knowledge
to really be able to push both farming and
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to insert genes from other
species to have a good outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to genetically modify
organisms to be able to be good
[SPEAKER_00]: ecologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can actually use what's naturally
available and use the tools that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned about in science to make the
success rates much higher and much faster
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually push us forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'm going to top that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we wrap up here, I want to do
something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your third time on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each time you come on, you're usually
coming to share some new aspect of science
[SPEAKER_02]: with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after the interview, you get
bombarded with emails and contacts and all
[SPEAKER_02]: this kind of stuff, more than you can
handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we go ahead and answer a
couple of the questions that you get hit
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff's all on your frequently asked
questions on the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's hit the big two.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do people buy your seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess that's pretty much the
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there any left for this year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people are generally pretty
disappointed when they find out to get
[SPEAKER_02]: your seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They generally have to be a prior
customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you lay that down real quick?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before before we wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always get seed from our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get seed from our website,
Oregon CBD seeds dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, you have to have an
industrial hemp license issued by either
[SPEAKER_00]: your state or by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really nothing that we can do
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did stop sales and we do this every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you are in a state like California
or Florida, where there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: growing seasons, we shut our sales down
for for each year, July 1st, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to take advantage of farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to get plants in the
ground or seed started after July 1st in
[SPEAKER_00]: the northern hemisphere, you're you're
really missing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've missed the boat and you're not
going to have a good crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we halt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start sale sales for twenty twenty
one on these new Triploid Varan Rich 100
[SPEAKER_00]: percent compliant with the USDA 0.3 THC
rule on January 1st of twenty twenty one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully by that point, we can have a
little bit more clarity from the USDA on
[SPEAKER_00]: who's actually allowed to to purchase seed
and whether or not we can get these to
[SPEAKER_00]: home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be working diligently to try to
make that happen in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_02]: After you brought your your CBD auto
flower to the market, which honestly kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of remade the CBD market globally,
you sold out of those wicked fast because,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, everybody wanted tens of
thousands of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we expect that with Triploids for
the next few years as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like we're still seeing with like
some of the CBG stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it you know, you're here talking about
it because Triploids are the cutting edge
[SPEAKER_02]: of of cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is it going to take three,
four years for enough of them to be
[SPEAKER_02]: produced that they're going to be widely
available?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much do we expect on seeing these?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have enough production capability to
take care of the entire country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spent the last two years focused on
building out our our facilities and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically taking everything that we made
from seed sales and putting it back into
[SPEAKER_00]: science people and in our production
environment to make sure that we could we
[SPEAKER_00]: could meet those goals and get everybody
taken care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, congratulations on that scaling,
because it was only a few years ago that
[SPEAKER_02]: you were all like, damn, we keep on
selling out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that frustrated people to no end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, you do everything that you
can to try to to meet the demand and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: people happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time to build capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are there and we're really happy to
be able to to get people what they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Seth, as always, thank you so much
for joining us and sharing your very
[SPEAKER_02]: unique perspective from where you're
sitting in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always cool to hear about the new
things that you know, cannabis scientists
[SPEAKER_02]: in general are working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since since genetics is your bread and
butter, it's nice to hear what you are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be bringing out before it comes
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for your for your
kindness and your stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the the best show on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got some of the best people
listening to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait for him to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you again soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening to Shaping Fire.
Thanks for listening to Shaping Fire.
