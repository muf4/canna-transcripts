[SPEAKER_01]: The stock market is a moody beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how much insight you have or how
many Fibonacci lines you draw on your
[SPEAKER_01]: charts, there are still innumerable
pitfalls that can cross your path and ruin
[SPEAKER_01]: your trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: The risks involve skyrocket too when you
invest in a nascent industry like
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rapidly changing market, lack of
historical data, and of course federal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis prohibition all make investing in
cannabis unlike investing in any other
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.

[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Alan Brockstein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alan is a CFA charter holder based in
Houston, Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: He began his career on Wall Street in 1986
and now works as an independent research
[SPEAKER_01]: analyst following over two decades in
research and portfolio management.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is founder of the 420 Investor online
community, which is the first and still
[SPEAKER_01]: largest due diligence platform focused on
publicly traded stocks in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a prolific writer too, with over 650
articles published since 2007 at Seeking
[SPEAKER_01]: Alpha, where he has 70,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alan is a frequent speaker at industry
conferences and a frequent source to the
[SPEAKER_01]: media, including the New York Times,
the Wall Street Journal, Fox Business and
[SPEAKER_01]: Bloomberg TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's currently writing columns for both
Leafley and Forbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Alan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to speak with you and
I'm looking forward to addressing your
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm glad that you could set aside
the time for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, at the heart of investing is
the weighing of risk versus reward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in an explosive industry like ours,
with so many variables moving at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time, how do you recommend investors
approach determining how much risk they
[SPEAKER_01]: are comfortable with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's risk is what it's all about,
Shingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you started with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I showed up on the scene in 2013,
I saw a lot of risk and absolutely no
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity, at least in the public
markets, which is where I was initially
[SPEAKER_00]: focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even today, I like to remind people
that this is all federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my community at 420 Investor,
I'm in the middle of a survey right now
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm about to close out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the people have 75 to 100
percent of their portfolio invested in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to remind people of a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, federal illegality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, most of the publicly traded
stocks are on the over the counter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a whole different kind of worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has to do with penny stock fraud,
which is rampant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do like people to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, I like to point
people to Canada where that federal
[SPEAKER_00]: illegality isn't the same issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so flesh that out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what what is different about the
approach in Canada versus how it is here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, some people may not realize it,
but Canada has a federally legal medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It launched officially in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the second version.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had one that launched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're on the cusp of being
totally federally legal for adult use as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that that impacts
everything and impacts banking,
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes, everything, all these problems we
have in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to deal with in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Canada is not as big as the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost as big as California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as unpacking one's risk goes,
you know, anywhere that you invest in a
[SPEAKER_01]: license product market in the US,
your first, you know, monster in the room
[SPEAKER_01]: is, oh, yeah, it's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least if you were to invest in
Canadian companies, those companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: they may or may not themselves be a good
company, but at least they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it goes a little bit deeper
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes it easier to invest in
companies that, you know, your audience is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably familiar with 280 E, for
instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's unfortunate,
but even companies that operate well,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to pay sometimes 80 percent
marginal tax rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't have to deal with those
kind of problems in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When considering investing in companies,
it's amazing how atypical looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: profit and margins and P&L is different
because there are line items that are
[SPEAKER_01]: there that don't appear in traditional
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are additional line items that
you don't find in other businesses just
[SPEAKER_01]: because cannabis is such a unique sector
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the federal regulation aspect
of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, certainly overall, we have this
umbrella of investing in US companies are
[SPEAKER_01]: a challenge because they're federally
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we've got things that happen on a
weekly scale, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got, you know, Jeff Sessions says
one thing this week and then he seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: say something different another week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: With, you know, is it going to be schedule
one, schedule two, unscheduled?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there seems to be an intentional
media circus around these things because
[SPEAKER_01]: it all is clickbait on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it all tends to be kind of
constantly a fervor of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you recommend to your investors
and guide them to either react or
[SPEAKER_01]: non-react to this kind of intentional
excitement of investors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole Jeff Sessions thing is
definitely a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like one of those clouds that
you see lingering all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And will it actually rain?
[SPEAKER_00]: In last November, when the election
results were pouring in, I was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: shocked initially to see not only that the
Senate was going to go the other way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but more importantly, that we're going to
have a change in administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing I thought of was we
are at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I told my subscribers at 420
Investor that we have a risk factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean anything's going to
happen, but it's something that the
[SPEAKER_00]: markets are going to have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really caused a problem because the
stock prices had run up going into the
[SPEAKER_00]: election and then they pulled back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I don't think Jeff Sessions
is actually going to get his wish,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is to roll back cannabis,
whether it's medical or even adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see the coal memo kind of ramped up
a little bit so that there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see that, but I don't think that
would kill the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, this remains a risk factor and
something that the media, as you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, really overplays and it scares
people and it scares the entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you think back to 2013,
after Washington and Colorado had voted to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize in late 2012, everybody was
sitting around waiting on the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government to see what would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put in place the coal memo in
August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, all the
entrepreneurs and investors were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward in both states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's probably too late to roll
it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an issue now where a lot of
states are pulling in a lot of tax money.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of employment in the sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably more importantly,
the will of the voters just continues to
[SPEAKER_00]: really point to tolerance for recreational
cannabis and actual embracement of medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we saw that in the Florida
elections, very conservative state,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of older people, yet they got past
the 60% requirement to pass medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, which was something they were
unable to do in the prior election.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think that it's actually the state
and local governments that are more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem for the cannabis industry than the
federal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government is obviously not
helping the industry, but it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: status quo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it's the municipalities in the
states where we're seeing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that in Ohio a couple of weeks ago
when they handed out licenses and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of controversy there already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen delays in a lot of states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of municipalities pushing
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see rule changes that can really hurt
these cannabis companies when they all of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sudden change the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you started off talking about risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different risks in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's talk about a couple of other
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, on a company-to-company level,
in an industry like ours that's so
[SPEAKER_01]: fast-paced and for the last 50 years has
been in the shadows, now that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: able to work on these products and these
technologies and these business solutions
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the open more, we get people who
are developing extraction technologies at
[SPEAKER_01]: this wicked rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the technologies are becoming outmoded
and being surpassed by new companies at an
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you weigh these fast-paced
technologies and solutions becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: outmoded so quickly when you're trying to
decide whether or not a company has got
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term viability?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I'm actually really excited
about this because this is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things I mentioned that's really one of
the best things about our industry that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have time in incentives for people to make
big changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you're looking at it as a threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is most of the cannabis stocks
that have been trading over the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years are really not real and we haven't
really addressed that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's not so much a risk for cannabis
investors as an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see some of these innovative
companies move into the public sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for the most part, you're talking
about in the private investment world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a lot of companies do neat
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing companies jump from basically
where they'll have a product developed for
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just call it a regular industry and
then they adapt that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about like POS systems,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes a lot deeper and the thing
that I really focus on and I'm not seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: it yet in the public markets, but we're
getting close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is technology that will enable us
to have cannabis beverages, rapid acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be necessarily
beverages, but rapid acting cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles that really get around one of the
worst aspects of edibles, which is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the onset is so slow that people tend to
overdo it sometimes and really cuts down
[SPEAKER_00]: on social.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw just today Shaleen Tidal has been
able to pull off in Massachusetts the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to have social use, which is
something we haven't really seen in any
[SPEAKER_00]: market yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly not in Colorado, the original
legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to get on parity with the
alcohol industry, that's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I say, it's more of an
opportunity than really a risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody's gonna lose by the
way the market's changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, flower is still very popular,
it runs at about 50% in your state still
[SPEAKER_00]: and in most states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're seeing all these other really
neat forms of delivery and innovation in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the modes of ingestion or
consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: When an investor is looking at a company
and considering investing, there's so many
[SPEAKER_01]: unproven executives in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me of the first dot-com boom
where you'd have a visionary who had some
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of access to capital and so they
started from nothing and they may have
[SPEAKER_01]: been a middle manager or less at some
company beforehand, but they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody with moxie and access to some
capital and off they went building their
[SPEAKER_01]: dot-com and the majority of them failed
from either running out of cash or just
[SPEAKER_01]: from poor management or both.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you weigh for yourself the fact
that there are so many inexperienced
[SPEAKER_01]: managers who are running these companies?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years ago, I started sharing my 3P
analysis of companies and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: investors really fall for one of the P's.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first P is the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually say that first,
but I'm gonna say it to you first.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that they're trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's their plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the second P is the people and that's
kind of what you're asking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the third one that you kind of
alluded to as well, I call it the
[SPEAKER_00]: pecuniary because that is a P instead of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the PP and the M.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I try to tell people is don't get
caught up on the plan, first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plans are pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you look at the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important because you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even for myself, I'm not the best stock
analyst in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just the only one crazy enough to
show up here in 2013 which gave me a
[SPEAKER_00]: running head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same way, people were either smart
or stupid, but they came into this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry because they saw an opportunity
and there's a lot of stigma that keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing huge changes on that front over
the last six to 12 months where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing just a rapid influx of really
qualified people and that's a good thing
[SPEAKER_00]: for the industry, but it's gonna get to
the point where, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these people that were here a
couple years ago, they're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: qualified to lead the industry
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the money part, I think it's
important because people that were paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention in the dot com could have seen
the cash burns and lack of tangible
[SPEAKER_00]: results and figured out that that wasn't
gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I run into all the time when
interviewing folks and then just doing my
[SPEAKER_01]: own research on companies are the two
different kinds of leaders that they tend
[SPEAKER_01]: to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: On one side, you've got companies that are
led by folks who have their life
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in prohibition era.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cannabis people, first and
foremost.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in the shadows when it became
more normalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've come out of the shadows and now
they're running their company,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because they were doing black market
business for all these years, they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a lot of the traditional skills that
you'd get at a fully legal corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on the flip side, you've got all these
new people coming into the industry that
[SPEAKER_01]: have little to no cannabis experience
except for maybe toking themselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they have worked at blue chip
companies and they know how to read a P&L
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're used to working with venture
capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got that side, but then they don't
know what to ask a master grower when they
[SPEAKER_01]: go to hire them because they're not from
inside the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you weigh between the two of those
when you're considering investing?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question and it's
something I point to a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm flashing back to the one and only
MJBizCon I went to in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to other conferences, but I don't
like big crowds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a divergent group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had, like you said, the suits and then
the people that knew what they were doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not necessarily so business savvy in
the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, I haven't been back to that
conference, but at other conferences,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed it's getting bridged.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I try to counsel anybody who'll
listen to me is look for the management
[SPEAKER_00]: teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't necessarily have to have the
cannabis expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good to have somebody on the
team that really has it, but you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: that on an outsourced basis by having good
consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to make sure that the suits
running the company are grounded in the
[SPEAKER_00]: reality of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, it's very possible that
you could have people that are emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: from the black market that never have the
felony or it's going to be hard to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that don't have the management savvy
on their team, but they have good
[SPEAKER_00]: counselors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily have to have those
people, but I really like to see
[SPEAKER_00]: management teams where the two sides have
been able to come together and appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: that if they want to really accomplish a
lot, they're going to have to draw from
[SPEAKER_00]: both those wells and work together and
that they've internally resolved that and
[SPEAKER_00]: can show that unified presence to their
investors or customers or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're really spot on to mention
consultants because even though a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consultant air quotes is kind of a running
joke because you can't go to a convention
[SPEAKER_01]: without bumping into hundreds of cannabis
consultants, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can third party those types of skills,
which makes the skill that the the suit,
[SPEAKER_01]: to use your words, they don't necessarily
need to know how to set up an extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: lab, but they have to be really good with
their human resources approach to know how
[SPEAKER_01]: to find the right kind of person who
actually knows how to set up a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in these early days, I would say that
we're finding more people who have hired
[SPEAKER_01]: the wrong people and they fall out of that
relationship and they have more success
[SPEAKER_01]: with their second or third person because
they're actually having to learn from
[SPEAKER_01]: their mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear about, you know, we're on our
fourth master grower kind of discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking about Canada earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is even up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the same problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's even worse, but it really
hits home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always try to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a horse in this race,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, you know, I'm kind of an observer and
an analyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a lot of sympathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the people who fought the battle
to get us to where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really pains me when I see like
what's going on in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these people are going to really
not be in the industry, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Oregon was a good state.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've let people, even with felonies,
participate in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most states don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But up in Canada, they have the exact same
problem with the people that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: operating in the gray market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're disenfranchised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've noticed, you know,
some of the companies have figured this
[SPEAKER_00]: out and have tried to bring them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just recently, the federal government
of Canada proposed kind of a second tier
[SPEAKER_00]: producer called a micro cultivator,
I guess, like a craft cultivator,
[SPEAKER_00]: which from my understanding, this is an
attempt to broaden the industry because if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to make the industry better,
you want to kill off the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to push the people with all
the expertise out and make them compete
[SPEAKER_00]: with you in the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good for society.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot we can unpack there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's exactly what happened here in
Washington, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of blessing the medical medical
medical just got straight killed and they
[SPEAKER_01]: gave the licenses to all the newcomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've got this this highly
integrated networked black market that
[SPEAKER_01]: also happens to have incredible
technology, CO2 extractors, and great labs
[SPEAKER_01]: competing with the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's it's ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so in this in this first section of the
show, we've talked a lot about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: unique and ugly risks that investors have
to consider when when looking at these new
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and you know, it's enough to cause
people to just say, man, forget investing
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's too noisy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a safe place for my money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put it somewhere else that's got less
of the these risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: When when you hear people who are kind of
looking for a reason because they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: invest in cannabis, but they also see
these risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything that you can tell them
to kind of soothe them to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, you know, keep looking in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I've been, you know, I've been
learning about these risks for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really an inflection point in
my cannabis career when the local CFA or
[SPEAKER_00]: Chartered Financial Analyst Society asked
me to speak in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I wouldn't have done it until this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the industry, the
investment set has definitely improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The risks are still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they've gone down and they're
better understood now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I tell people in the four twenty
investor community is mitigate the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put all your money into the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put it all into one stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd give the same advice to any
private investors were they to ask just in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of, you know, making sure you don't
have too much exposure to any one
[SPEAKER_00]: situation, because just the fact that it's
a new industry, you should be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a venture capital type of approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, if you have make 10
investments and one of them is a 10
[SPEAKER_00]: bagger, it doesn't matter what happens
with with the rest, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what I try to tell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: To to be diversified and to not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's mainly a diversification
shingle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is Alan Brockstein,
founder of New Cannabis Ventures and 420
[SPEAKER_01]: Investor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you own a cannabis company,
you know that finding good business
[SPEAKER_01]: partners, vendors and allies is an
essential part of your role.
[SPEAKER_01]: And building your business in a new
industry like cannabis doesn't always make
[SPEAKER_01]: that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canna Con is coming to Seattle,
Boston and Detroit in the first half of
[SPEAKER_01]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the halls will be filled with every
kind of ally you need for a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technology, horticulture, packaging,
marketing, legal, human resources and
[SPEAKER_01]: media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything you need for your business will
be there and your customers will be there,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canna Con is a premier cannabis business
and networking event with nationally
[SPEAKER_01]: recognized speakers and the opportunity to
have serious conversations with your
[SPEAKER_01]: business peers and investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reserving yourself a booth at Canna Con
can unlock a lot of doors for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do you get to network with all
the people who pass your booth,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is not uncommon for Canna Con
vendors to do a million dollars in
[SPEAKER_01]: business during the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Booths are already sold out for Seattle,
February 15th, 16th and 17th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So reserve your booths now for Detroit in
June and Boston in July while you still
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Attendee tickets are still available for
all three events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you reserve a booth or attend for
a day, do not miss the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: become a serious player in your local
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visit cannacon.org for tickets,
booth reservations and more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cannacon.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I certainly still enjoy smoking
joints, I moved over to using vaporizers
[SPEAKER_01]: about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high was a little different than
burning the flower and in the end I
[SPEAKER_01]: decided I preferred it for daily use,
especially because I have asthma.
[SPEAKER_01]: More importantly though, I could taste my
flower so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to express to you how
significantly different cannabis with a
[SPEAKER_01]: good terpene profile tastes when vaped
instead of burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have brought my vape with me to visit
growers and they are astonished by the
[SPEAKER_01]: clarity of taste and they say they feel
like they're tasting their flower for the
[SPEAKER_01]: very first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Air Vape Vaporizer from airvapeusa.com
is a great device to use on the go or at
[SPEAKER_01]: home.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you pick it up, it feels satisfying
like a medical device.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't flimsy like many vapes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how the flower is inserted in the
top instead of the bottom so it travels a
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter path to my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the cannabis at the top, I get a hit
that feels more substantial even though
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just inhaling vapor and not full
bodied smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I use this vape for flower,
hash and concentrates, I really like that
[SPEAKER_01]: the digital control for the temperature is
right there on the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three clicks of the button and it fires up
to the temperature I specify really
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly and discreetly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vape concentrates are a milder experience
than dabbing but you still get the potency
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the taste is great as would be
expected with a low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that this vape gives quick little
vibrations when it gets to the right
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way if I'm chatting or distracted
while it's heating up, it lets me know
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are ready for a nice pocket sized
vaporizer, consider the Airvape.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new Airvape X has just come out and
it's gorgeous and includes many updates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find more about the Airvape
vaporizer at airvapeusa.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Alan Brockstein, founder of
[SPEAKER_01]: New Cannabis Ventures and 420 Investor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the first set, we talked a lot
about the high risks that are involved
[SPEAKER_01]: with investing in these cannabis companies
and the importance of being diversified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most everybody is getting their
information about these companies on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these cannabis companies are so
obscure and a lot of the news about them
[SPEAKER_01]: seems somehow canned and prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: How should folks interested in cannabis
investing go about starting their research
[SPEAKER_01]: into their target companies?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This led me to start a new business
because I was running 420 Investor from
[SPEAKER_00]: late 2013 into 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just scratching my head about the bigger
industry, instead of just the public
[SPEAKER_00]: stocks, we're talking about the whole
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I was known for at 420
Investor was being a really good filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much noise and people wanted to
get information on the good companies
[SPEAKER_00]: only, not all the noise out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I was trying to do at
420 Investor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started New Cannabis Ventures in
September 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that goal, to focus on just the
really good companies and the really good
[SPEAKER_00]: investors because there's a lot of fake
investors too, which we can talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to find news and I think your
listeners deserve to know that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole concept of fake news is supreme
in the cannabis industry, in the public
[SPEAKER_00]: stocks especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen it even in private
companies, these press releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, we don't have operations today,
but we're going to have 100 million in
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could tell your listeners of all
the different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some great content creators out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they're kind of competitors of
mine at New Cannabis Ventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely have an investor audience,
but we get a lot of operators as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Business Times I think does a
great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a cultivation focus,
but they have real news.
[SPEAKER_00]: MJ Biz Daily has really stepped it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have journalists on staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've widened their content,
so I think that's a good place for people
[SPEAKER_00]: to get information from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Industry Journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some good podcasters besides
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I include you in the list, but there are
some others as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to name them all,
but I think it's important to really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand kind of what the source of the
news is because if it's just being paid
[SPEAKER_00]: for and it's not really earned,
it's not really that real and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of that going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one of the sources that I like that
does not overly pump things up is Alex
[SPEAKER_01]: Halprin over at Weed Week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: His curation is really nice and he doesn't
add drama to things, but that was
[SPEAKER_01]: originally what attracted me to your New
Cannabis Ventures because I think you do a
[SPEAKER_01]: really good job curating as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your intent when you curate is different
than a lot of other sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of other sources, they're curating
because they want clicks and they want
[SPEAKER_01]: people to comment and they want the drama
and the sharing and the arguing and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff, but that's not your
goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your goal, you started New Cannabis
Ventures to be of service to the investors
[SPEAKER_01]: in your 420 Investors community,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of just trying to get the clicks,
you're trying to create a base so that
[SPEAKER_01]: people have got good information in the
community you run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's a really important
delineation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not just in that community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's broader and it's really extending
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so people understand our business
model, we're very transparent and go to
[SPEAKER_00]: our site and see exactly who our
advertisers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt we run our advertisers'
news.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't share our views.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never say you should invest in my
advertiser, but we run the news of their
[SPEAKER_00]: competitors too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell our advertisers,
our readers are the most important thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't have our readers, we don't
have a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've earned the trust of our readers for
two reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, that we've been very much a
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've written some pretty negative stories
about posers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well known for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really a second point.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can count on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's important news, we're going to
publish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing, but they can also
count on us to really call people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do go to conferences, people will
come up to me and they'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to tell you, I love the way
you're willing to call these jokers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, I don't have to do that that
much, but I actually enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weird thing in our society that you
can make a lot of money saying good things
[SPEAKER_00]: about people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, if you want to say bad
things about people, you run a big risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sued for $100 million back in 2013
by a company that's now bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, they called this libel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut and paste their SEC filings,
and they didn't like that, and they sued
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can sue anybody for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to absorb the expense of getting
that eliminated, but I was scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: $100 million, a lot of money, even for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cannabis, cannabis is drawing out a lot
of first-time investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they've talked their whole life,
and this is the time that they've always
[SPEAKER_01]: hoped would happen, and they want to get
involved, or people who were around for
[SPEAKER_01]: Google going public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's like, oh, if I only would have
invested in Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heck, a lot of my friends are doing that
right now around Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of new investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love for you to just briefly explain
for folks just to help them be aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of news about the habit of,
I guess we'll call it, fake news sources
[SPEAKER_01]: pumping up a company or a stock to elicit
excitement, and then whoever's behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: play then dumping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you just explain that dynamic a
little bit so that people can read with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more skepticism?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love where you're coming from,
and you are spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many people of all ages that
are showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This started not recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started back in 2013, but it's still
happening with California about to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is what people don't
understand about the OTC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with the cannabis
industry, this problem that I'm about to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just human nature and snake oil
salesmen and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime something's hot, like Bitcoin
right now, it draws in the scammers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cannabis industry has drawn in
fake cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been going on for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I like to point to the positive that
there's a lot more real companies now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's undoubtedly true that there's a
ton of posers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people behind these companies,
this is what a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand, the financiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get free blocks of stock or very
cheap blocks of stock, and they'll pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: news to go out there, and it sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: People see this, and they don't understand
that it's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes a temporary blip in the price of
the stock and the volume, and it allows
[SPEAKER_00]: these scammers to unload their shares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I wish I really understood it
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SEC is overworked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know if they had more money and more
power, they would not allow this to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, but it's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are companies that don't even file
with the SEC, which I can't even believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They file on what's called OTC markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even some of the SEC filing companies,
they do things that should be illegal,
[SPEAKER_00]: yet it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We read about it after the fact,
unfortunately, where the SEC enforces
[SPEAKER_00]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to wonder how many of these do
they not catch, but they'll put out a
[SPEAKER_00]: press release how they caught these people
with these illegal offshore accounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were doing this and doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes on every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the unfortunate part about the
cannabis market being on what's called the
[SPEAKER_00]: over-the-counter, or OTC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these stocks don't trade on the
New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very unfortunate, and it leaves
people with a really bad taste in their
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth because they're excited about
investing in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they go in with their eyes wide open,
and they get taken advantage of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they think there's something wrong
with cannabis or something to that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a structural problem,
not related to the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but related to over-the-counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, the idea of pump and dump is
way easier to do thanks to social media,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it used to be so much more
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you coordinate two or three media
sources and you put out a tasty bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: news and suggest that everyone's buying
it, and then you buy a big chunk yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: so that the stock goes up, a little bit,
which somehow proves to people that the
[SPEAKER_01]: news that they're reading is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all these second wave investors jump
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's really going up, which then
really doubly proves that the media source
[SPEAKER_01]: is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as soon as it hits the target level
for the people behind this misinformation,
[SPEAKER_01]: they dump all of their stock, the price
crashes, and then all of these first-time
[SPEAKER_01]: investors and even pros, their money just
vaporizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound like you know what's going on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sure you're not a pump and dumper
yourself, Shinko?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just a nerd, and I did the dot-com
boom, and it was really common then too.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The social media part, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see all sorts of Twitter bots.
[SPEAKER_00]: My partner has actually researched some of
the names that we've written on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're able to prove that there's fake
bots out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pushing, saying good things about
the company on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to set up an Instagram
account and show pretty pictures of Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these things that can really
play to that psychology of making
[SPEAKER_00]: something fake look real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about informal information that
happens too.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I run into all the time,
being in media and being at conventions,
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to Shaping Fire, listening to a
podcast through your earbuds, as many
[SPEAKER_01]: people do, is a pretty intimate
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have access.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in their ear, and we're talking
usually weekly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these executives, they take me
aside at events, and they tell me things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're excited about this merger that's
about to happen or this company they're
[SPEAKER_01]: about to acquire or this new technology
that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bursting, and they just want
somebody who they feel is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate it with them because they're
excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell me or they tell an associate of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, suddenly, we know information that's
not publicly available.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is happening all the time,
especially with executives who are new to
[SPEAKER_01]: playing at this level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used to just talking with their
friends over beers or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now they're playing with seven figures
or more of valuation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is this line between being a smart
investor and asking questions that other
[SPEAKER_01]: people aren't asking so you can unearth
valuable information versus straight-up
[SPEAKER_01]: insider trading where you could get in
some trouble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very sensitive to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your audience doesn't know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't invest in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the reasons why I don't
because I don't want to be in that
[SPEAKER_00]: position of crossing that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people I speak with,
they tend to be in the public market,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they're going to be very careful about
that anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very careful in general with me,
so I don't really get that crossing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: line and saying things that should be
disclosed publicly but aren't,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm sure it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's a big risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have clients, as I mentioned,
and they sometimes want to give me
[SPEAKER_00]: information and sign an NDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to know anything that's not
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't, so I try to protect myself
and them by not accepting confidential
[SPEAKER_00]: information, but I can see how that's a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that lack of willingness to sign
an NDA is a really interesting aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to chew on that a little
bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want privileged information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not investing, especially with a
public company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You read about this all the time,
these people getting busted for insider
[SPEAKER_00]: trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be one of those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about companies that are on the
far side of maybe not a pump and dump,
[SPEAKER_01]: but are on the far side of the media's
excitement about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm into some cannabis companies that I
bought stock in early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got up to a couple bucks,
few bucks, and then maybe they lost a CEO
[SPEAKER_01]: or their product didn't get adopted as
fast or, like we were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, their local laws changed or there
was a moratorium or something just messed
[SPEAKER_01]: them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got up to a few bucks and now they're
just out of languishing at 30 or 50 cents,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the kinds of things that ... If
the company is going to have a rebound,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are stocks that are on sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things that you can get at a low
price so long as they eventually go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the investor side, what kinds of things
can happen for these companies that were
[SPEAKER_01]: up and now they're down that actually can
revitalize and be seen as a value stock
[SPEAKER_01]: that's undervalued?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me warn everybody because I think in
the middle of our third big rally since
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013, the first one around Colorado,
the second one in advance of the elections
[SPEAKER_00]: last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's in advance of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I've been talking about for
a while, but I always like to point out to
[SPEAKER_00]: people and I've even been writing about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I posted something on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That historic rally in early 2014 when
Colorado legalized, there weren't that
[SPEAKER_00]: many stocks and there were a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were talking about the excitement
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine everybody's trying to get into the
arena right in time and the line's long to
[SPEAKER_00]: get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pushed prices way high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the early stocks that went to
prices that really made no sense and that
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would caution investors just in general
to understand that there are a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tracked maybe 20 stocks at the beginning
of 2014 that were cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm at 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those are Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot more stocks and just a
little bit more subtle point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those stocks back then,
the insiders held like 90% of the shares
[SPEAKER_00]: and so there was just a small amount that
was in the public float and that created
[SPEAKER_00]: an artificial mechanism that really forced
those stocks to really unsustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: levels because if you factor in the other
90% that weren't trading, these stocks
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't have gotten to where they got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you the industry in my view has
really improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started at New Cannabis Ventures
tracking the companies that have $10
[SPEAKER_00]: million a year or more in sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I couldn't have
done last year, but we now have I think 14
[SPEAKER_00]: companies on this page where we're
updating it as the numbers change that are
[SPEAKER_00]: on track to $10 million a year or more
revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, some of them are pushing $30
million or $40 million in a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as an investor, to answer your
question, what's going to make these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are down work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Check and see if they're generating
revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, just generating revenue isn't
in the long run going to be the only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have to be profitable
ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to just have to keep going
back to the markets and diluting and
[SPEAKER_00]: forcing your price lower over time as
there's more shares.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my first clue to take a look
and see what kind of progress they've made
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you go back and you look at the
companies that were trading at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of 2014, most of them haven't
really done anything, Shango,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is we have a bunch of new
companies that have come along that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think are pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are on that list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never considered how much of the
early cannabis stock was held inside and
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore that 10% that was the public
float, people were investing not based on
[SPEAKER_01]: the characteristics of the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: The price was going up based on scarcity
rather than value.
[SPEAKER_01]: No wonder so many of those turned around
as their angel investors in original
[SPEAKER_01]: owners dumped some of their stock so that
they could eat and live and re-up
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit of that but just to be
clear, these companies didn't have much in
[SPEAKER_00]: the term of operations so just to keep the
lights on, not the individuals necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: although that was partially the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you remember Medbox but they also
just had to raise some capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean like fundraising, using it as a
fundraising tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is such a sad example and I actually
like this company by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called CV Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gone in a slightly different
direction because they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop through the FDA path a chewing gum
with CBD and nicotine but their core
[SPEAKER_00]: business, they're on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing more than $10 million a year
in sales selling CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're highly regarded there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of these stocks that had that
thin float and went to like $200 a share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even today it's at 30 cents a share.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of funny but the stock goes up
to $200.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get on the cover of Forbes magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was insider selling but then they
ended up raising a bunch of money below $1
[SPEAKER_00]: a share.
[SPEAKER_00]: They raised some at $2 after the stock was
at $200.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: $200 was not the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go to commercial, there's one
more category of investor that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of people ignore and those are
the people who are involved with sweat
[SPEAKER_01]: equity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not necessarily public
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, they're either
pre-public or just privately held but
[SPEAKER_01]: they're people who have been told,
okay, I'd like you to come in and run my
[SPEAKER_01]: lab and set it up and use your consulting
expertise but we don't want to pay you
[SPEAKER_01]: decently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to pay you 15 bucks an hour and
we're going to give you equity in the
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: This happened so often during the dot-com
boom, even to me where I had equity in six
[SPEAKER_01]: or seven companies that were worth less
than a rubber duck with a hole in it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're seeing a lot of that now
where there are a lot of employees who
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to be part of a company that's
going to make it and they want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: their green rush money by taking a low
wage and also taking some sweat equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any advice for an employee
who's thinking about taking some equity in
[SPEAKER_01]: lieu of immediate financial compensation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not given it thought but the first
thing that comes to mind because I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: really seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really get into that granular
level but if you're working for a company
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want you to take equity,
take a look at what they're showing
[SPEAKER_00]: outside investors just so you understand
exactly what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean this is not just the cannabis
industry but any industry and I've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times people can be really smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be an engineer or some sort of
graphic designer, really smart at what
[SPEAKER_00]: they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that they understand how
to value companies or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a copy of what they're showing
investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't understand it, take it to
somebody who does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay them a couple hundred bucks,
whatever it is to have somebody say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what is it or if they're giving
me 10,000 options, what does that even
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there 10 gazillion shares or are there
20 shares at its extreme?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that can be really challenging
for a lot of people because not everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: has that expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be my advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take another short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Alan Brockstein,
[SPEAKER_01]: founder of New Cannabis Ventures and 420
Investor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We humans are attracted to plants because
they offer us relief and are a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes though the best parts are buried
inside the plant and we need to use
[SPEAKER_01]: specialty extraction technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to cannabis, it is
extraordinarily important to extract its
[SPEAKER_01]: precious oils without changing them in the
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to preserve the properties of the
cannabinoids, terpenes and other
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents that all work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1994, Eden Labs has been developing
extraction technology and processes to do
[SPEAKER_01]: just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs was founded by a cannabis loving
engineer during the early days of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana in California and the expanded
Eden team has been designing and building
[SPEAKER_01]: industry leading solutions for cannabis
extraction ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs flagship product is the newly
improved high flow CO2 extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: As other extraction companies enter the
market, it is the high flow from Eden Labs
[SPEAKER_01]: that everyone chases and tries to compare
themselves with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but the improved automation
software allows data to be collected,
[SPEAKER_01]: stored and studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs can outfit your whole lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden's cold finger ethanol extractor
creates astonishing whole plant extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: working alone or in tandem with an initial
stream distilling step to isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: monoterpenes before extracting the rest of
the botanical constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden offers you many options including
vacuum distillation, column distilling,
[SPEAKER_01]: stirred reactor units and accelerated
solvent recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you partner with Eden Labs,
your lab team is enrolled into the Eden
[SPEAKER_01]: Labs training program to boost their
understanding of Eden's best practices to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that your outputs are exactly what
you require for your application,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be dab oil, oil for pen
cartridges or edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you work with Eden, you're not just
buying the tech, you're buying dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: customer support to help you attain your
business goals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear Eden's CEO, A.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Braddock talk about the company's values
during Shaping Fire episode 19 that was
[SPEAKER_01]: all about CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the new companies in the market
just smell opportunity, slap an extractor
[SPEAKER_01]: together and hire a marketing company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs has been listening to feedback
from extractors and consumers for about 25
[SPEAKER_01]: years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about both you and your
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partner with Eden Labs to extract
astonishing cannabis oils and terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: that you'll be proud of.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Lowes, and our guest
this week is Alan Brockstein, founder of
[SPEAKER_01]: New Cannabis Ventures and 420 Investor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Alan, in this last section,
we've been talking a lot about what we see
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so often with investing, people are,
they've got their head down and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: learning and they're looking too much in
the now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see out 10 years in this
industry that investors should be
[SPEAKER_01]: considering when investing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Investing in things at this time?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry changes so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years is like 50 years if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I have a 10 year view,
but let me just answer it as a longer term
[SPEAKER_00]: view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the, you know, as a US,
from a US focus, one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously is, you know, what's going to
happen with the federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my own view there is we're not going
to see any big changes in the next few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe after the next presidential
election, the problem is, as much as the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal politicians seem to be accepting
of it, it's a very complex issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to deal with things like
getting rid of 280E, which the government
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a lot of money off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do they want to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to get into things like,
does Colorado really want it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: federally legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, they're going to lose tax money
because California is going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: export to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so many different things that are
going to have to be resolved in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't think federal legality is in
the next five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wish they would legalize it,
but I think from an investor's
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, that's fine because it allows
a lot of companies to kind of build up
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to face a lot of
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a deal that your listeners
should be aware of, which took place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was announced right at the end of
October and close in early November,
[SPEAKER_00]: where a US based liquor company or alcohol
company Constellation Brands put 190
[SPEAKER_00]: million US into Canopy Growth,
which is the largest Canadian federally
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a game changer in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main thing it really said was A,
the alcohol industry is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: B, hey, maybe it's okay to make an
investment in cannabis, but you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: structure it properly, make sure it's
federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in the next few years,
we're going to see a lot more interest
[SPEAKER_00]: from Big Pharma and the alcohol industry
and maybe a little bit tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really personally see how tobacco
has much to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people like to say that it
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some distribution things,
I guess, but the reality is I think those
[SPEAKER_00]: other two industries, as I look out in the
next few years, that's from a US investor,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be something to really
focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time to watch some of the
better companies really develop their
[SPEAKER_00]: franchises in the very complex,
difficult markets to navigate right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can't ship across state lines
and you have to deal with all these local
[SPEAKER_00]: rules and state rules and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing I think is going to be
really big, and I've been talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: this for a while, is the globalization of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing it in Latin America,
we're seeing it in Australia, we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: it in Europe, and of course Canada,
which I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the US is getting left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of ironic to me because we
have a president who likes to be a winner,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are a loser when it comes to the
global platform of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole world is moving ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think anybody that's looking at
cannabis should really start to think long
[SPEAKER_00]: and hard about expanding their opportunity
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially when you look at things
like Germany, and it's a little bit slow
[SPEAKER_00]: to play out, but they have pharmacy
distribution that's covered by insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a small program now, but it's
going to get a lot bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way the world is headed,
where medical cannabis is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: legal everywhere, federally, except
apparently the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really good point that
you're making.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talk about it a lot with my own
clients, this area of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to come in two waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have your first wave when
eventually we'll be able to ship
[SPEAKER_01]: interstate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you've got all these states where
you cannot naturally grow outdoors very
[SPEAKER_01]: easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my state's one of them here in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've only got a small part of the state
that gets enough warmth and sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as our market is able to be
colonized by California, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: drastically change the outlooks of
companies here in Washington or anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: on the northern side of the country,
where suddenly business plans that seemed
[SPEAKER_01]: solid if you only were doing business in
your state are suddenly going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: trashed because the southern states with a
lot more sunshine are going to be coming
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And similarly on the international level,
oh my goodness, once Central America and
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico are able to grow outdoor and
process organic cannabis oils and ship
[SPEAKER_01]: them to the United States, the floor is
just going to drop out of the oil market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think a lot of investors are
thinking about how drastically the market
[SPEAKER_01]: itself is going to shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you want me to throw another one in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not quite there yet, but this
whole concept of biosynthesis where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow cannabinoids and not just THC or
CBD, which are expressed pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently, but some of the cannabinoids
that are expressed less frequently like
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDV that may be very valuable for medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this without cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it through this biotech
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine putting all this money into indoor
grows, all that capex, and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: the infused cannabis industry just starts
buying the biosynthesized cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I think people need
to be aware of in the longer term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can totally see an upcoming shaping fire
on that topic now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did one, I don't know, about three
months ago on synthetic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the general push on that is that
they're synthetic and they've got
[SPEAKER_01]: attributes chemically that are
non-natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they can have real negative,
both agonist and antagonist attributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're describing is actually
growing the molecule exactly as it occurs
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while it's isolate, and we can argue to
what degree isolates are useful for health
[SPEAKER_01]: and recreation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact that they could just grow
CBDV in a lab and have it be molecularly
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll reshape parts of the industry as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
