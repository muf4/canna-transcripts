[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Shango here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a little context real quick
before we watch the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this was recorded in a log cabin
grange hall here on Vashon Island,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it does not make for very good video
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: The acoustics are bad, the heating is
loud, and we have to turn off the light so
[SPEAKER_00]: people can see the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're there at the Vimeo meeting,
it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very homey and intimate, but it
doesn't really translate very well to
[SPEAKER_00]: video cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know this isn't an as good of quality
as some of the other stuff that I share
[SPEAKER_00]: with you, but, you know, this is a pretty
rare talk for Ethan Russo to give
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured that getting what you can is
better than not getting at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it sounds good,
you know, but there's some high,
[SPEAKER_00]: loud points, and then it gets quiet,
so you might have to adjust your volume a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all in all, it's a great piece,
and it's serious analytical information
[SPEAKER_00]: for people who take their pain management
serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please welcome Ethan Russo!
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Funkadelic Grange.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not everywhere that you can
speak in a place that looks like Lincoln
[SPEAKER_03]: Logs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my email,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I wanted to start out by showing you
the names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane, maybe you could turn off the heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, it's going to shimmer,
and people are going to think that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: getting off.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to start off with a
rendition of cannabis in various ancient
[SPEAKER_03]: languages, starting from the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just point out a couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fourth one is Chinese, the kanji for
ma.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually a pictograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is showing stalks of hemp drying upside
down in a shed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anywhere in China, that'll be
recognized as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, next to the last, is kanobosum in
Hebrew, which means aromatic cane,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was a component of the holy
anointing oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the Greek, the more familiar
cannabis with the accent on the first
[SPEAKER_03]: syllable.
[SPEAKER_03]: This talk is the same one that I give to
physicians and scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be some technical stuff I will
try to explain.
[SPEAKER_03]: But CB1 is the receptor in the brain where
THC works.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have natural endogenous chemicals
within that work on the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a happy accident of nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the CB1 receptor is highly expressed in
areas of the brain that relate to pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nociception.
[SPEAKER_03]: And includes the cerebellum, the limbic
system, which is involved with emotional
[SPEAKER_03]: type issues, basal ganglia with movement,
also reward pathways that relate to
[SPEAKER_03]: whether a drug is addictive or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, interestingly, there's some parallels
between the way that cannabinoids work on
[SPEAKER_03]: pain, and the way that opioids work on
pain, although they're really distinct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the main differences is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason people die from heroin or other
opioid overdoses is because too much of it
[SPEAKER_03]: will depress respiration.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depresses an area in the lower
brainstem, the medulla, and people quit
[SPEAKER_03]: breathing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no amount of THC or cannabinoid
that can do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no fatal overdose that's
possible with this kind of drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the endocannabinoid system,
these natural chemicals within,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not just in the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the gut, it regulates things like how
fast things move and how much liquid there
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the spinal cord, not the nerves in
the body.
[SPEAKER_03]: The endocannabinoid system has about 30
different roles.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these were summarized in 1998 by
Professor DiMarzo as relax, eat,
[SPEAKER_03]: sleep, forget, and protect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's involved in all these other
things, pain, memory, whether you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to vomit or not, whether you're going to
have a seizure or not, on how fast the gut
[SPEAKER_03]: moves or how slowly it moves.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are lots of different ways that
cannabis affects pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it is mediated by the CB1
receptor, but there are a lot of other
[SPEAKER_03]: ways in which this happens too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it relates to neurotransmitters,
those chemical messengers in the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are interactions, as I mentioned,
with the opioid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got an endogenous system there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got a parallel that morphine
works in the same places that natural
[SPEAKER_03]: chemicals called enkephalins and
endorphins work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all I want to say there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are the mechanisms by which pain
is produced?
[SPEAKER_03]: Analgesia is pain reduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: This endocannabinoid system has a baseline
level of activity that's there naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's too low, people are going to have
excess pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the level of things are high,
there's going to be less pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through complicated mechanisms,
there's an area in the brain called the
[SPEAKER_03]: periaqueductal gray that's involved in the
integration of pain signals, and it is
[SPEAKER_03]: especially active there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also in the area of the thalamus,
where cannabinoids, like THC, are 10 times
[SPEAKER_03]: more potent than opioids in the nerves
that make these relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's also involved in the spinal
cord.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is responsible for some
associated phenomena of pain that are a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit weird, like hyperalgesia.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that touch is perceived as
being really painful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like this wind up where there's a
buildup of these pain mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these all relate to mechanisms of
inflammation as well, and things as simple
[SPEAKER_03]: as itch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Itch is just a mild form of neuropathic or
nerve-based pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are the components of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've mentioned THC, the main psychoactive
component that works on CB1, but that
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly is not all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, cannabidiol, which is
probably familiar to this crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the non-intoxicating
anti-inflammatory component of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the raw cannabinoids in the plant,
tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, or THCA,
[SPEAKER_03]: also has an effect on pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this does the raw form of cannabidiol,
cannabidiolic acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then an especially important one is a
terpenoid, one of the aromatic components
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis, called karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this one's interesting because it's
also working on another cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: receptor called CB2 that's active in the
body in relation to inflammation and pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: But doesn't produce any psychoactive
effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a chemical like karyophylline that just
works on CB2 doesn't produce a high,
[SPEAKER_03]: but does have benefits on pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is designed to show you how
things used to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is of a preparation that was made
by Park Davis on a pharmaceutical company
[SPEAKER_03]: about 100 years ago or more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And although it may be hard to read,
the components are morphine, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: and capsicum, or chili peppers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got three plant-based drugs that
work on endogenous systems of pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't know all these chemical
relationships, but this is an example of
[SPEAKER_03]: what we call empirical discovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: That people tried these things over time
and noticed, hey, this is good for pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you didn't need to know the
biochemistry in any great detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's interesting about this preparation
is it's probably better than anything
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got through conventional means
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably gave this to people after
surgery and let them go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as long ago as the 19th century,
it was known that cannabinoids produced
[SPEAKER_03]: opiate sparing, meaning that when you gave
cannabis people required less morphine for
[SPEAKER_03]: pain control, and that it could be used to
help get people off of those kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: drugs, because it treated the withdrawal
symptoms too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you may think this is a new finding,
but we've known this for 150 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that a lot of people would like
you to forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I mentioned, there are interactions
between cannabinoids and opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: THC actually stimulates the production of
what's called beta-endorphin.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the natural chemicals within
that has an effect like morphine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it interacts in this periaqueductal
gray area, the opiate sparing I've
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: But animal studies that were done over a
decade ago also showed that when THC was
[SPEAKER_03]: present you could prevent the development
of tolerance to the opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tolerance means you have to eventually
give a higher and higher dose to get the
[SPEAKER_03]: same level of pain relief that was
necessary previously.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also produces a rekindling.
[SPEAKER_03]: This means that if you give a dose of
morphine and it wears off, it's no longer
[SPEAKER_03]: good at reducing pain, a little bit of THC
will bring it back to where it's active
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a phenomenon that patients
observe too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The scientist, Diana Sikowitz,
that did all these nice studies then,
[SPEAKER_03]: I met her in 1999 and told her,
gee, this stuff you're reporting is
[SPEAKER_03]: fascinating, but did you know that they
knew the same thing 150 years ago?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, she was all surprised at the time,
but we became friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit more about CBD, some very
interesting studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are, again, rat studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave cannabidiol to rats that were
trained to press a lever to get heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your tax dollars at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were actual changes in
expression of neurotransmitters in the
[SPEAKER_03]: brain in areas that relate to addiction
that CBD produced and reduced the craving
[SPEAKER_03]: such that the authors of the studies
suggested that CBD should be used as a
[SPEAKER_03]: treatment in humans for heroin craving and
to prevent relapse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some wisdom there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this one's a little complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: These were studies that were done in New
York.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a series of patients that
sustained damage to an area of the brain
[SPEAKER_03]: called the insula.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened, and it was a variety of
different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some had damage due to car accidents,
some from strokes, some from other
[SPEAKER_03]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what happened was some of these people
were cigarette smokers, and when they had
[SPEAKER_03]: this injury to the insula, they quit
smoking with no craving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody who was addicted to tobacco knows
this isn't normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they figured out that the insula was a
very important area in relation to craving
[SPEAKER_03]: related to addiction, and it wasn't just a
cigarette.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same thing was shown for cocaine,
alcohol, and opioids like heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you do this without producing
damage in the insula?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as it turns out, as we see here in
the scan, a very large dose of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabidiol, 600 milligrams at a time,
depresses the insula, and that's the blue
[SPEAKER_03]: thing you see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the area of the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was interesting was this change
was produced without any particular
[SPEAKER_03]: sedation or other major side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD alone is non-sedated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are other mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've mentioned previously, CB2,
the non-psychoactive receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been a lot of companies that
have made drugs that are selective for
[SPEAKER_03]: that, that hopefully would treat pain
without producing a high, because that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what the government likes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But none of these have been developed
commercially, because they all have ended
[SPEAKER_03]: up with various side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was important about this was it
produced dopamine release, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: related to drugs that tend to be
addictive,
[SPEAKER_03]: and rodents that were trained to be
addicted to cocaine know longer would
[SPEAKER_03]: self-administer.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, it was a reduced addiction
to cocaine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, karyophylline, this natural
component of cannabis, is a selective CB2
[SPEAKER_03]: agonist, a drug that works there,
and should do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an area that needs to be
researched.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, an old study from the 1970s,
and basically what we see here is there
[SPEAKER_03]: can be comparing the pain-relieving
effects of codeine and THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is plain THC, not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be like Marinol.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, 20 milligrams of THC was
the same as 120 milligrams of codeine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So take your choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be very high or be very constipated.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a study that was done in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was using Trinobinol synthetic THC in
patients who have pain related to multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they showed improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: These p-values are statistical indications
of how significant something is.
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.02 means there would be a 2% chance that
the result was spurious, was due to
[SPEAKER_03]: chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's considered significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the problem was anybody who's
taken plain THC knows it's not a very good
[SPEAKER_03]: drug, not very pleasant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two-thirds of the patients knew what
they'd gotten.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an indication the study was not
blinded properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: If people can tell the difference between
the drug and the placebo, it skews the
[SPEAKER_03]: results.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with a drug that's psychoactive,
like plain THC, it clearly is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very hard thing to avoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a study that was done in San
Francisco by a friend, Donald Abrams,
[SPEAKER_03]: neuropathy, nerve-based pain in patients
with HIV AIDS.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, as a typical study that the
government approves, we had to use NIDA
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They required that it be a limited number
of patients for a limited amount of time,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that they all had used cannabis
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's not all the population,
and you can't generalize this to everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess they were worried that someone
would freak out and be a problem for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a reduction in pain,
and about half of the patients had a 30%
reduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: in their nerve-based pain over the five
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30% is considered highly significant to a
patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were a lot of side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can see in the table, anxiety at
25%, sedation over half, disorientation
[SPEAKER_03]: 16%, paranoia 13%, confusion 17%.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't the profile of a drug that the
FDA is ever going to approve.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a problem with all smoked and
vaporized studies to date, with one
[SPEAKER_03]: exception.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you may be wondering at this point,
how would it ever be that you could get a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis-based medicine FDA approved,
or by that token, any botanical or drug
[SPEAKER_03]: made from a plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is this blueprint for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was formalized in 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you don't need to see the fine
print.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to show safety, efficacy,
and consistency in phase one to three
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phase one means you give it to normal
people to see how long it lasts in the
[SPEAKER_03]: blood and what their reactions are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phase two is you give it to a limited
number of patients with the disease in
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phase three is large numbers of patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, with all this, the trick with
the botanicals is, eventually,
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got to show everything that's in
it, all the different components,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that they are within tight tolerances.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not great variance over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: One drug that has done this is the drug
that I worked on a development of with GW
[SPEAKER_03]: Pharmaceuticals called Sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was made from two different
chemovars, chemical varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the proper term for strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have strains of bacteria and strains of
viruses, but although everybody likes the
[SPEAKER_03]: name, there are no strains of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are chemovars.
[SPEAKER_03]: In any event, it was from a high THC
chemovar and a high CBD chemovar that were
[SPEAKER_03]: combined to make what is essentially a
tincture in a spray in the mouth,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's called the early-cozol
administration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each spray has 2.7 of THC and 2.5
milligrams of CBD along with terpenoid and
[SPEAKER_03]: other components.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you took enough to feel it,
it would have onset in about 15 to 45
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes, so a little slower.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot slower than smoking and a little bit
faster than purely swallowing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is grown in what they call glass
houses in England.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call it grain houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's inorganic media.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all female clones from mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: No fertilization.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all tightly controlled as to
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good bugs eat the bad bugs in what's
called integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no pesticides or anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: In relation to pain, there are a bunch of
studies that were done in neuropathic
[SPEAKER_03]: pain, pain associated with MS,
etc.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll show some of the studies in more
details.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, as I mentioned, the studies in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: have all been done with NIDA cannabis of
low potency, very limited duration.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we pull all those studies up until a
few years ago with smoked or vaporized
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, it's a total of three patient
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be one patient smoking every
day for three years, or it could be 300
[SPEAKER_03]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you can do the math.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: In comparison, a few years ago,
a few years back, there were 6,000 patient
[SPEAKER_03]: years with this sad event, nephizomals,
just in pain studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a tremendous gap in what the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: has allowed with domestic supply versus
what a British company did, including some
[SPEAKER_03]: studies in U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, you can't really have a
domestic source of cannabis in development
[SPEAKER_03]: as a medicine, but you can import it from
a foreign country.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how much sense that makes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, we've ceded this whole industry
to foreign companies, and it explains why
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked for foreign companies for most
of the last 23 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go into some specific studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are with Sativex, the spray in the
mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a study that was done for what's
called peripheral neuropathic pain with
[SPEAKER_03]: allodynia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Allodynia means that a touch is perceived
as a burning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a phenomenon associated with things
like diabetic neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could also happen as a toxic reaction
to certain drugs like chemotherapy,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 125 patients over five weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the patients were on their way with
medicine, a variety of other drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be opiates, it could be
opalsense, it could be antidepressants to
[SPEAKER_03]: try to treat nerve pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all the patients had failed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they still needed something else,
and this was just added on to see if you
[SPEAKER_03]: could get any improvement over the
baseline.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're looking at 10-point pain scales.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero is no pain, 10 is the first pain you
can imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it may not look like much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look at placebo, you've got a
half of one box improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: As compared to the viximals in the blue is
a point and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now again, doesn't seem really amazing,
but for a pooled population, that's a
[SPEAKER_03]: significant difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see the p-value is 0.004.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means there'd be only four chances in
1,000 if this was a mistake, according to
[SPEAKER_03]: the statistics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in terms of how much people improved,
again, let's look at the 30% improvement,
[SPEAKER_03]: highly significant to patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, a big difference between placebo in
the purple and the Sativex in the blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: In allodynia, this phenomenon of touch
feeling like burning is not something that
[SPEAKER_03]: is treated effectively by conventional
drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there was this statistically
significant improvement with the viximals
[SPEAKER_03]: or Sativex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patients global impression of change is
basically, are you better, are you worse,
[SPEAKER_03]: how much?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see that this is skewed to the
left, meaning that the blues are a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: higher than the purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the advancement in the majority of
people were somewhere between minimally
[SPEAKER_03]: and very much improved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the same idea in multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: MS is not something that people who don't
have it usually associate with pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, a lot of people with MS do have
what's called central neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Central neuropathic pain from whatever
cause is extremely difficult to treat and
[SPEAKER_03]: rarely benefits from any conventional
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were 66 patients in this study
for five weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, unimproved on the best medicine
conventionally applied and added on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, placebo, you've got about a
box and a quarter improvement and about
[SPEAKER_03]: two and three quarters on Sativex,
five chances out of a thousand that this
[SPEAKER_03]: was a spurious result.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about as good as you get with this
kind of study.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, the patient's global impression
of change is skewed towards improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was about four times more likely that
patients on viximals would report
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement as compared to patients with
placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another study in rheumatoid arthritis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the only study, even though this
is old now, it was done almost 15 years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only study, formal study of a
cannabis-based medicine in rheumatoid
[SPEAKER_03]: arthritis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were 58 patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: The design was a little bit weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fellow that did it said, oh,
my patients are not gonna accept any side
[SPEAKER_03]: effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they decided they'd just give it at
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this isn't a drug that lasts 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever you see here could have been a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just gave it at night up to six
sprays for five weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they looked at this two different
ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, by one measure, there was
significant improvement, a box and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: As compared to half a box with placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a pain in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pain on movement in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually people that have this are at their
worst in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they looked at a thing called the
DAS-28.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 28 questions that ask patients
disease activity score.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drugs that usually produce this kind of
improvement are what are called disease
[SPEAKER_03]: modifying.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may see these advertised on TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're biologicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They cost 30 to $50,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a lot of potential nasty
side effects like creating tuberculosis
[SPEAKER_03]: when you didn't have it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was this signal of benefit on
this DAS-28.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm sorry to say there's been no
follow up on this study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because no one picked it up and
funded it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about cancer pain?
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been a variety of studies with
the same preparation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first two studies, phase two studies,
were done in smaller groups of patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first study was done in hospice
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: In England and I believe in Belgium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second one was a larger
number of patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll look at these.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the two-way study was in a hospice
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these are patients that are already
on optimized opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: The highest dose that they could use
without terrible side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with remaining pain that was still not
adequate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And acceptable level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus a bunch of other drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically these patients were on five
drugs to try and treat the pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, they're using a 0 to 10
numerical rating scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: On epiximals, Sativex showed a significant
improvement as compared to placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: P value of 0.14.
[SPEAKER_03]: 14 chances out of 1,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a thing called the continuous response
also was improved over placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 30% response rate was seen in 43% of
patients in epiximals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And only 21%, half as many, on placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I want to really key in on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this study, they were not just using
epiximals.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a high THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extract with no CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was epiximals or Sativex.
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference between the high THC
extract and Sativex is the presence of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabidiol in Sativex.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at the 30% level,
the gray is the placebo response.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's about the same as the response
with the high THC extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now compare that to the orange,
which is the Sativex, THC and CBD plus the
[SPEAKER_03]: other components.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was statistically significantly
better than the two other preparations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the first demonstration of the
synergy, the additive effect on pain of
[SPEAKER_03]: having multiple components or a whole
cannabis-based medicine as compared to
[SPEAKER_03]: what would have been primarily THC alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a second phase two study was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was what was called a dose ranging
study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patients were, instead of choosing their
own dose based on their response,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were placed within narrow limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: A low, a medium or a high dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the low dose was one to four sprays a
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mid, six to 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: And high range, 11 to 16.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this did not go the way you might
expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes less is more.
[SPEAKER_03]: The high dose range turned out to be
poorly tolerated because of the degree of
[SPEAKER_03]: side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a great surprise, but the efficacy was
not there either.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was found was that group
statistically didn't show any improvement
[SPEAKER_03]: in pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was left out and we'll look at the
low and medium dose ranges.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we see here is that at any level
improvement, there was this clear
[SPEAKER_03]: difference between the placebo in the gray
and the low and medium doses of sprays of
[SPEAKER_03]: Sativex in the green.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we look at the two studies
together, again there was a difference,
[SPEAKER_03]: always a difference of benefit of the real
drug over placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again with statistical significance.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you see here, the difference in the
length of the bars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then something interesting was happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that the FDA will totally
ignore.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the first study in the hospice
patients, some of the patients lived a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: longer than expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have what's called an open label
safety extension study.
[SPEAKER_03]: This means that everybody knew they were
getting Sativex and they continued on to
[SPEAKER_03]: see what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 10% of patients took it for six months
and 5% for more than a year before
[SPEAKER_03]: succumbing to the disease or stopping it
for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two things happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: One wasn't a great surprise to me and that
was that they didn't have to escalate the
[SPEAKER_03]: doses of Sativex over time to get the same
level of pain relief.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now bear in mind, these are people dying
from cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That isn't what you'd expect.
You'd expect to be more drugged.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the real surprise was what you always
see, an increase in opioid dose did not
[SPEAKER_03]: occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: At all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking again on average.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a really expected thing, graduated
doses of opioids in patients dying of
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer just didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because this was an unblinded study,
there was no placebo group, it isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: considered by the FDA at all because that
is the model, the only model that's
[SPEAKER_03]: accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a patient with multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had disabling pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: On Sativex, she was able to lower,
not only get improvement in pain,
[SPEAKER_03]: but reduced her dose of amitriptyline,
an antidepressant used to treat pain,
[SPEAKER_03]: from a very high dose of 150 milligrams to
25 milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was better enough that she
returned to full-time work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Counseling other patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are patients I interviewed and
had permission to share their stories and
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a Dutch lady with sciatica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although she was Dutch, she had never used
cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was on lung-acting morphine,
MS-contin, a high dose of 180 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_03]: reduced to 30 milligrams, and her pain
diminished from a nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's excruciating down to a four,
which is moderate pain, but tolerable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're gonna go through some other
studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I haven't shown you is the results of
the phase three studies in cancer pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these were done in the States,
but a bunch of other countries around the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now these three studies did not lead out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unfortunately, the results that were
seen in the phase two studies were not
[SPEAKER_03]: demonstrated in the phase three studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally we say, well, that shows it
didn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that really wasn't the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know this because it worked fine with
statistical significance in the American
[SPEAKER_03]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did not work in the patients outside
the US, but there was a clear difference
[SPEAKER_03]: in the patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you from having spent time
going to clinics in Romania and Poland,
[SPEAKER_03]: that those patients were sick as hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: In those countries, you've got to be near
death to get opioid treatment to begin
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you fail that, you're in really bad
shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was demonstrable that these
patients were a lot sicker, often near
[SPEAKER_03]: death, and they just didn't respond.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a problem with the mandated patient
selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the FDA was so worried that,
well, maybe giving this cannabis-based
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine will give people cancer,
that they would only give it to patients
[SPEAKER_03]: who already had cancer that were near
death.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you're not stalling for work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, shifting gears.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a really important study.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked at what happened to rates of
opioid-associated mortality, people dying
[SPEAKER_03]: of overdoses.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened as states legalized medical
access to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened was, as you know,
we have this opioid epidemic, and there
[SPEAKER_03]: have been increasing rates of deaths over
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the rate of increase was much
lower in the states where access became
[SPEAKER_03]: available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the longer it was available,
the slower the rise was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really significant difference is such that
it was estimated that 1,729 lives were
[SPEAKER_03]: saved in 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, if the relationship between
medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic
[SPEAKER_03]: overdose mortality is substantiated in
further work, enactment of laws to allow
[SPEAKER_03]: for the use of medical cannabis may be
advocated as part of a comprehensive
[SPEAKER_03]: package of policies to reduce the
population risk of opioid analgesics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's been another several years,
and everything that's come out indicates
[SPEAKER_03]: the same thing, that when cannabis is
available, you see fewer deaths due to
[SPEAKER_03]: opioid overdoses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other studies, very recent.
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked at various studies,
animal and human, and they did what's
[SPEAKER_03]: called a meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where you combine studies and
crunch the numbers to see what the stats
[SPEAKER_03]: show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, 90% of studies before
giving to humans showed this synergy,
[SPEAKER_03]: boosting effect, combining cannabinoids
and opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the effect of dose 50, the dose at
which 50% of people will find efficacy on
[SPEAKER_03]: pain of morphine with THC is much lower,
highly statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as they pointed out, the studies like
the ones I showed you with nabiximals are
[SPEAKER_03]: not powered to show opioid spares.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, we didn't want people
could lower their dose if they had to,
[SPEAKER_03]: like they were super constipated.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the idea was to try and maintain what
they'd taken previously and see if
[SPEAKER_03]: nabiximals made a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a study, 118 patients using
cannabis, 64% reduction in opioids,
[SPEAKER_03]: while at the same time, there was this big
improvement, 45% in quality of life
[SPEAKER_03]: measures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that could have been due to fewer
opioid-related side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stacy Gruber at Harvard did this study
where patients were looked before they
[SPEAKER_03]: were on cannabis and three months after
using cannabis medicinally.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a marked improvement in
depression with a back depression
[SPEAKER_03]: inventory, better sleep, better quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who had been on opioids,
cut them in half, reduction of about 48%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also benzodiazepines, drugs for anxiety
that are highly addictive, also about 50%
[SPEAKER_03]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, their cognitive ability,
how they think, their memory was also
[SPEAKER_03]: significantly improved, again,
possibly due to having lower doses of
[SPEAKER_03]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea that you're going to take
cannabis and be a zombie is just not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then an experimental study on normal
humans looking at pain, combining cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: with oxycodone, a synthetic opioid,
showed some of the same things that had
[SPEAKER_03]: been shown in the animal work,
that when you had a dose of oxycodone that
[SPEAKER_03]: was too low to reduce experimental pain,
it became effective with a very low dose
[SPEAKER_03]: of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these may be more meaningful to
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a study of fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a significant opioid sparing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 20 patients reduced to five that
required opioids after treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the peak value is .000.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that's real folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because there was no placebo involved
here, this study could have been done here
[SPEAKER_03]: and the FDA would not accept it at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have no meaning at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another study done in Israel reported this
last year, medical cannabis in a large and
[SPEAKER_03]: selective population out of 344 patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: A third were on opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: 36% of those could discontinue them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost 10% decreased their dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only 1% increased and 51% were stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, opioids sparing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: For decades, high doses of opioids have
been used for chronic non-cancer pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, low back pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: People with it could be on opioids for
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was never studied this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was never a long term study to see
if it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, to boil down a bunch of stuff,
they had 240 patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half were put on an opioid regimen,
half on a non-opioid regimen.
[SPEAKER_03]: After a year, there was no significant
difference in the pain levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pain intensity was actually better in
the people who were not on opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as might not be a surprise,
there were a lot more side effects in the
[SPEAKER_03]: opioid group.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically what they showed is that
opioids don't work for chronic non-cancer
[SPEAKER_03]: pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: What opioids should be used for is acute
pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just had surgery or you were in a car
wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you have cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have a broken ankle and the
pain continues, you shouldn't be on
[SPEAKER_03]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's about time, 2018, that somebody
demonstrated this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens in a situation where
someone is addicted, dependent on opioids?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they qualify as having a cannabis use
disorder, whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis can be used in conjunction with
opioids, as you've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if people are dependent on opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: But any close follow-up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're better after a while,
it is a reasonable thing to try and reduce
[SPEAKER_03]: the opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And often, patients do this on their own
without a lot of instruction from doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone has a high level of cannabis
usage, let's just say 10 grams a day,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's been demonstrated by my colleague,
Dustin Sulak, that they can be
[SPEAKER_03]: resensitized, as he called it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What he has them do is quit for 48 hours
and then resume at half the prior dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he's found is the efficacy on
pain is the same as it was at the higher
[SPEAKER_03]: dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much better to use less and get the
same effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So conclusions.
[SPEAKER_03]: The endocannabinoid system has a
clinically important role in mediation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis has a bunch of analgesic
components, especially THC, CBD,
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of the terapinoids, especially
cariophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clinical trial success or benefit of a
drug is very dependent on the preparation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just because something worked,
something different may or may not work,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has to be proven on its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got one cannabis-based medicine
that's been proven in a variety of
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical trials on nubixamols,
approved in 30 countries, just not here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is in Canada, but you can't bring it
over the border.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I didn't show a lot of,
the side effect profile, adverse event
[SPEAKER_03]: profile of nubixamols is a lot less
frequent than those reported with THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: THC alone, or particularly conventional
drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that there's a horrendous level of
opioid addiction with mortality in this
[SPEAKER_03]: country.
[SPEAKER_03]: 72,000 Americans died in 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, unfortunately, was my niece.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need something, and one of the some
things is clearly cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, I'll be happy to take
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, I can't quote your chapter
and verse on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are set of criteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, to be rated as addictive or
having a use disorder would indicate that
[SPEAKER_03]: you have a preoccupation with the drug in
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you think about cannabis all the
time, or you spend a good part of your day
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to get it, or you commit crime to
get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of flaws with this,
and to be fair, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: psychiatrists that think that there really
isn't any such animal.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ask me, are there people that have
a problem and use too much cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it ain't heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can create family discord, people can
spend too much money, any number of
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's not gonna kill someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to look at it a little bit
differently and deal with it a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there would be these kind of
problems if we had more balanced
[SPEAKER_03]: preparations that had a significant amount
of cannabis in the dial as well as THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's not what people generally ask
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had an important question down here
about references for this material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go ahead and email me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the material that I presented
aside from the most recent studies was in
[SPEAKER_03]: a book chapter that came out a few years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be happy to send to any of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Jim.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure which slide it was,
but you bring up an important point.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know from animal studies, if we're
looking at pure cannabidiol, that up to a
[SPEAKER_03]: point a higher dose gives you better pain
control and then it falls off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called a biphasic effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see this with a lot of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may surprise you to know that THC,
we know that it reduces nausea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too high a dose it can produce nausea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the trick with cannabidiol is when
it's a whole cannabis extract with the
[SPEAKER_03]: turbinates present, you don't get this
fall off in the response to pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get, no matter how high the dose is,
you continue to get pain reduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really an important demonstration
of why we shouldn't be worried about using
[SPEAKER_03]: isolates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isolates are something that better fit the
pharmaceutical industry model,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is, oh yeah, we know what the target
is and we use one drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Botanical medicine is exactly the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the idea that, gee, we've got a bunch
of components that act in concert and
[SPEAKER_03]: produce a non-taurage effect and a better
benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This experimental study done by Ruth
Galili in Israel showing this benefit of
[SPEAKER_03]: having a whole cannabis extract that's CBD
predominant preserves the pain reducing
[SPEAKER_03]: effect rather than having it fall off with
CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, can you talk a little bit about the
karyophylline content in the roots and why
it's important to use roots?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the roots are important,
but there isn't any karyophylline in the
[SPEAKER_03]: roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are other components.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've written about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The roots have been used traditionally as
long as the tops have, and they do have
[SPEAKER_03]: analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they seem to come from other
components called triterpenoids,
[SPEAKER_03]: fredolin and epifredolinol.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few alkaloids, not high
concentration in the roots, whereas there
[SPEAKER_03]: are none in the tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: The roots haven't gotten the attention
that they deserve in recent decades,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a lot of people are making artisanal
preparations with the roots and reporting
[SPEAKER_03]: good results.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I wrote an article with Natasha
Riz about this a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'd be happy to send that to
anybody who would like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to learn more about the
cannabis root ball, we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: interviewed Natasha Riz about cannabis
root ball medicine on Shaping Fire podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linda?
[SPEAKER_01]: Using the product for inflammatory
problems, how soon should you expect to
[SPEAKER_01]: see some results?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it build up, or is it pretty
immediate?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why do they pick the amount of time
they use in the study?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, two different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're talking about pain, depending on
the method of administration, people may
[SPEAKER_03]: notice things pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Treating inflammation is going to take
longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with a stable pain condition,
we tend to see improvement over time for a
[SPEAKER_03]: prolonged interval.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't show all the safety extension
studies with sad effects, but typically
[SPEAKER_03]: patients who are using it a long time
actually decrease the number of sprays a
[SPEAKER_03]: day that they utilize.
[SPEAKER_03]: They needed less to treat their pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a cumulative effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they choose in the study,
the studies depends on what they think
[SPEAKER_03]: should happen and what the powers that be
will let them do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now part of the problem is, a lot of the
pain studies that were reported were done
[SPEAKER_03]: in the prior decade and five weeks was
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: That isn't true now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most pain conditions the FDA will say you
have to treat for 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a problem here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is, we know from looking at a
bunch of studies that the longer you
[SPEAKER_03]: treat, the harder it is to show a benefit
over placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a marked increase in placebo
effect over the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's worse for a drug for treating
pain, any drug that's psychoactive,
[SPEAKER_03]: or in the case of cannabis where the
public thinks that this stuff is
[SPEAKER_03]: miraculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to tell you, it's not miraculous,
it is damn good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the way people think is that,
geez, this is my last shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hope this is gonna work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I must be on this drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not getting placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the way the brain works.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge problem right now in medicine
because many drugs that we know work don't
[SPEAKER_03]: work all that often.
[SPEAKER_03]: And something I said at dinner,
Zoloft, sertraline, the antidepressant,
[SPEAKER_03]: commonly used, they did 26 studies to show
three where there was benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the way in back.
I was wondering if you shared any thoughts
or experiences with cannabinoid hermesia
syndrome?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we've got a half an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what he's asking about, cannabinoid
hyperemesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a relatively new phenomenon
described.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's several hundred case studies
reported, but it's more common than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a situation where it only
occurs in the context of people who use
[SPEAKER_03]: very high amounts of cannabis on a chronic
basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only in that context.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe it's only in high THC
preparations.
[SPEAKER_03]: What typically happens is a patient will
develop terrible abdominal pain and
something that's absolutely, and they get
vulnerable, intractable, vomiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: The really characteristic thing is they
will notice at some point that if they
[SPEAKER_03]: take a hot bath or spend five hours in the
shower with hot water pouring over them,
they'll get better.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they end up in the ER.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get expensive gastrointestinal
work-ups.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't see anything and get given
opioids or other drugs that don't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: The solution to this is one of two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: The obvious one is to stop cannabis and
that takes care of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is going on with this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, nobody's sure, but it probably is
this biphasic effect that in certain areas
[SPEAKER_03]: of the brain you're getting an opposite
effect to what you expect from THC that is
[SPEAKER_03]: producing nausea and vomiting and
producing pain rather than stopping it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it could have to do with a
down-regulation of the receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where they fold into the cell
membrane instead of being out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rub that on the abdomen and it takes care
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will relate one story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's really weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it burn the skin?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the solution to this, it feels
like it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't produce damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: My theory is that capsaicin works on a
receptor called TRIPV1.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabidiol works on the same receptor
without being burning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my theory was that you can prevent
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome by having
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few months ago at a conference I met a
young lady who had this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about it and I said,
well first you've got to cut back or stop
[SPEAKER_03]: and then if you want to resume you need to
be looking for type 2 or type 3 chemo
[SPEAKER_03]: bars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those where there are equal amounts of
CBD and THC or even CBD predominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to say that she was at the
Emerald Cup in California a few weeks ago
[SPEAKER_03]: and she's vastly better because she's
using cannabidiol now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that is part of the solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for asking that simple question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you discuss the difference in positive
or negatives regarding hemp-derived CBD
[SPEAKER_06]: versus THC?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of this is semantics.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original hemp CBD was made by abroad
by using hemp refuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, they would use the seeds
or fiber and then the refuse that was left
[SPEAKER_03]: was chemically extracted and they get a
tiny amount of CBD out of it along with a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of garbage and that was hemp-based
CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, that's not the way you should
make medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want cannabidiol it should properly
come from dedicated high cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and from the flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the concentration is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my best preference is to get it that
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, again, selective breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are now plants with whatever ratio
you'd want of high CBD, usually low THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: plus a good terapinode profile that is
going to contribute to the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_03]: benefit of the preparation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will state clearly I'm biased but
that's the way I think it should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You went into a slide demonstrating 600
milligrams, I believe, of CBD functionally
[SPEAKER_05]: deactivated insula.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: What dose and how long did it functionally
interrupt that addiction craving,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you will?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, these weren't, they weren't
looking at craving in the study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would I use this as an example of what
could happen if you used high dose CBD to
[SPEAKER_03]: treat addiction?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a good question but that wasn't
what they were looking at here.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long the effect was, I suspect it
would relate to the half-life of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to say several hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, that, and we could find out
experimentally when we try this using high
[SPEAKER_03]: dose CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: To treat people with addiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find out how long is it good for.
[SPEAKER_03]: My suspicion is you should treat people
three times a day, maybe even a little
[SPEAKER_03]: more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that would depend on whether
they take it orally or whether it's
[SPEAKER_03]: inhaled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's hear it for Dr. Ethan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
