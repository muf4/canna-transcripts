[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it strange and exciting to suddenly
see psilocybin mushrooms everywhere?
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though as a species we have been
taking mushrooms since the very first
[SPEAKER_02]: humans existed, and perhaps even before,
it seems like some sort of threshold was
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed about six years or so ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly there were mushroom cultivation
classes all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an explosion in the availability
of mushroom cultivation books,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the number of websites providing spore
syringes of both culinary and psychedelic
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms expanded from being a cautious
home industry to being a bold and active
[SPEAKER_02]: and competitive home industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few cities in the country even took the
radical step of reducing penalties for
[SPEAKER_02]: possession of mushrooms, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this happened pretty smoothly and
elegantly after years and years of intense
[SPEAKER_02]: repression.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listeners of Shaping Fire very likely have
either microdosed mushrooms or LSD or
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely no someone who has.
[SPEAKER_02]: People talk about it out in the open and
on talk shows like there's nothing to fear
[SPEAKER_02]: at all, and honestly, from what I'm seeing
around the country, that is more or less
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The medical establishment has embraced
medicinal mushroom psychedelics much more
[SPEAKER_02]: swiftly than it has cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed, mushrooms are being adopted
faster, in part, because of the work that
[SPEAKER_02]: activists have done to normalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a significant wave of
pro-mushroom sentiment and it is growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good pun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaping Fire stands with the mushroom
educators, cultivators, neighborhood
[SPEAKER_02]: distributors, and all of us healing from
trauma or reaching out for enlightenment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you.

scientists or fairy folk, you are the
[SPEAKER_02]: forces of good.

[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today my guest is Adam Bramledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Bramledge is founder of Flow State,
Micro, working one-on-one with clients to
[SPEAKER_02]: individualize microdosing dosages,
protocols, and experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Along with the San Francisco Psychedelic
Society and the Microdosing Institute,
[SPEAKER_02]: Bramledge is the co-founder of Microdosing
Movement and co-founder and lead
[SPEAKER_02]: facilitator for the Microdosing Support
Network, the world's first bi-monthly free
[SPEAKER_02]: support group for microdosing education.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam also spent more than a decade in
California cannabis, cultivating sun-grown
[SPEAKER_02]: organic flowers and working in
distribution and manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sold his companies and pivoted into
mushrooms after using psilocybin to treat
[SPEAKER_02]: his treatment-resistant depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we are going to compare and contrast
several approaches to microdosing
[SPEAKER_02]: psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing I'd rather do than talk
microdosing with you today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we should probably state
right from the jump that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about mushroom therapies that are
still federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while there has been an increase in
both licensed and unlicensed research into
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms, we're going to be talking about
a substance that is illegal without
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So neither Adam nor I are suggesting that
you use mushrooms and we are certainly not
[SPEAKER_02]: offering you any.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the episode today, our goal is to
provide a quality interpretation of the
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge that's already publicly
available so you can make informed
[SPEAKER_02]: decisions for your health and when you go
to vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this statement covers the entirety of
the episode too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please enjoy the episode in an academic
way that it was intended.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Adam, anything you want to add to that
before we move on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I always like to mention I'm not a
medical doctor and I am not advising you
[SPEAKER_00]: to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are simply here to educate you and talk
about microdosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with us all on the same page on that,
let's get started by setting a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of context here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly much has been said about taking
full psychedelic trips on mushrooms of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, two or three or more grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that these experiences can
offer both psychological and spiritual
[SPEAKER_02]: healing and connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But today we're going to be talking very
specifically about taking regular very
[SPEAKER_02]: small doses of psilocybin mushrooms a few
times a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam, what can microdosing offer an
enthusiast that is different than taking a
[SPEAKER_02]: more traditional dose of a few grams?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the easiest way to sum it up
is when you're microdosing, there are no
[SPEAKER_00]: classic psychedelic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're doing a large dose journey,
you might have visuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel extremely high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are aware that you've taken a
substance, time may be distorted,
[SPEAKER_00]: visuals will be distorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing like that happens when you're
microdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is considered a sub perceptual dose,
meaning below the perception that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really noticing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might notice slight bit of energy
increase in mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, it does not have any
classic psychedelic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers are not talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doorknob doesn't have a mustache.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's something that you take in
your day to day life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still function.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still be a parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still drive a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still work your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get across to your listeners
that microdosing is very different than
[SPEAKER_00]: large dose journeys or macrodosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have any psychedelic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're taking a very, very small,
what we like to say sub perceptual amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning below the perception that you
notice it of psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's let's talk a little bit about
that threshold point very specifically,
[SPEAKER_02]: because at some point we're going to be
talking about people of about how much is
[SPEAKER_02]: in a microdose for the for the various
protocols that we're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, some people are like,
all right, so so what is sub perceptual
[SPEAKER_02]: and what is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so clearly we're not talking about,
you know, freestanding hallucinations and
[SPEAKER_02]: the examples that you gave.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but some people aren't sure whether or
not sub perceptual is, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: at low doses, some people feel like
something is brewing in their belly,
[SPEAKER_02]: like they can feel something might come
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with microdosing, it doesn't ever come
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like you feel like there's
something brewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that considered sub perceptual or is or
is are there are there gradations to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's different for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, sub perceptual might not be the
best word to describe it, because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of people that feel energy when
they're microdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, what we want to make a delineation
between is microdosing, where maybe you're
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling a little bit of energy and you're
getting that extra boost per se to mini
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing, which is anxiety in my stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really feel the substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if I'm coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to get stronger?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a fine line between the mini
dose and the microdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's different for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we like to say when we're
educating people is everybody needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: find their individual sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A microdose for me might be different than
a microdose for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has different levels of
tolerances, different ways that these
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms work with their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, it's different for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do like to feel a little bit
of energy, like to feel a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: of the substance when they are
microdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may take a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important when you're
microdosing that you're still able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that you would do in your
normal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that a lot of times anxiety is a
good indication if your dose is too high
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it's a microdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've taken psilocybin and your
anxiety is heightened and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling like being social, I believe,
in my opinion, that that's a mini dose and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not a microdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: A microdose should be at a level that
makes you more sociable, that lowers your
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's important in microdosing is that
when people are experimenting with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to start low and go slow at the
start at a really low dosage, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to experiment with what is too
much, what is too little, and what is just
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the Goldilocks analogy now
that I think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to start low, go slow,
but maybe you might have to take a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit too much some time to realize what the
difference is between subperceptual
[SPEAKER_00]: microdose and a mini dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I was originally learning
microdosing, people tended to suggest to
[SPEAKER_02]: me anyway that a default setting microdose
was 0.1 gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, I found that I felt more of
the effects at 0.1 than what I could
[SPEAKER_02]: consider subperceptual, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely felt it at 0.1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kept on bringing it, brought it
down to 0.9, then 0.8, and then 0.7.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find for me that if I really need to
not feel it, really for me, it's more like
[SPEAKER_02]: 0.6 or 0.7.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which gets chuckles from friends,
but there really is an important
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between a micro and a mini dose
in how you're planning on spending your
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if our goal is to start low and
increase slowly, what would you consider
[SPEAKER_02]: to be, based on what you're hearing from
people reporting to you, how low is the
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate place to start?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is 0.05 a place to start, and then go up
by 0.7?
[SPEAKER_02]: By 0.01s, or what are you seeing in your
experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think 0.05 is exactly where you
start, which is 50 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I run a microdosing support network
with the San Francisco Psychedelic Society
[SPEAKER_00]: twice a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have people show up that share with
us their personal stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one gentleman a few weeks ago,
a full grown ass man, probably weighing
[SPEAKER_00]: between 180 and 200 pounds, which shows
you that it's not strictly related to size
[SPEAKER_00]: of the person or weight, was telling our
group that he only needs 0.02 or 20
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to get across to people is
people, everyone is unique and different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no standard dose away that
psilocybin is going to hit you,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to mention there are different
varieties of psilocybin and different
[SPEAKER_00]: strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that also could hit you differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would start at, like you said,
50 milligrams and then go up to 75 and
[SPEAKER_00]: then go up to a hundred and then go up to
125 and 150 and go up maybe at 25
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there are a lot of people out
there that are microdosing that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: just enjoying getting high and they're
taking more than is considered a
[SPEAKER_00]: microdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are having some of the classic
psychedelics effects throughout their day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're enjoying it because it is
different than a large dose journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can function, but there is a fine line
between microdose and mini dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it depends on what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with the start logo slow,
like 50 milligrams is a great place to
[SPEAKER_00]: start.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody is taking that little bit
more than a microdose so that they're now
[SPEAKER_02]: taking a mini dose and they do feel it and
it's just adding positivity to their day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So long as it's not taking away from their
functioning the way they want to during
[SPEAKER_02]: the day, is there any inherent reason why
a microdose is superior than that slightly
[SPEAKER_02]: larger mini dose?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who am I to say that either one is
superior?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to be honest with you,
I have days where I have mini dose or I
[SPEAKER_00]: might be out in nature and I might take a
little bit more for connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's unique to the individual
and their experience and what they get out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not anyone special to say that
people shouldn't thoroughly enjoy mini
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know that there are times where
I enjoy concert dose when I dose properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are times when people enjoy the
museum dose, which is a little bit less
[SPEAKER_00]: than a concert dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I think there are great ways to
mini dose and museum dose and concert
[SPEAKER_00]: dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the caveat and the disclaimer
is you have to be, you know, somewhat of
[SPEAKER_00]: an expert psychonaut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to somewhat know what you're
doing because these are powerful tools and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to be safe and you want to be in
a good set and setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I really don't work with people
in large dose or mini dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just strictly stay in the
microdose area, but absolutely there are
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits from mini dosing and people that
enjoy taking a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think that there are there are
benefits to each level of dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you know, we've seen that
Terrence McKenna for a long time and the
[SPEAKER_00]: five grand hero journey has been a sign
of, you know, the large dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in reality, there's also Kalindi Ayi
who was talking about taking 30,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 grams of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you know, dosages are different
and unique to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't say that microdosing is
superior to mini dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to say about keeping it in
that microdosing range is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more sub perceptual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not noticing necessarily that
you're high as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing before we go on to talking
specifically about the stamens,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're not talking about macro doses
today, but you're so well versed at
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you please explain set and setting
for folks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because even if it doesn't have to do with
the show today, I think it's a healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: thing for us to remind and make sure more
people are aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set and setting is something that Leary
developed years ago, I think still while
[SPEAKER_00]: he was at Harvard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the idea set, meaning your
mindset and setting, meaning the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is psychedelics are powerful,
powerful tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not for everybody, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And set, you have to take them when you're
in a good mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not something you should take
when you're really struggling or having a
[SPEAKER_00]: really difficult time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then setting, you have to be so
careful when taking large doses about what
[SPEAKER_00]: your outside setting is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest with you, in the past,
I've been very, you know, I've definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: taken large doses in the wrong settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been very uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would not recommend it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for beginners out there who are
thinking about a large dose journey,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, the idea of set and setting tends
to be the most important factor probably
[SPEAKER_00]: next to dosage that depends or decides
whether or not you have quote unquote a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive or a quote unquote bad
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the focus of today's episode is to
compare two of the most popular protocols
[SPEAKER_02]: for taking low doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first is the protocol offered by
Paul Stamets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second we will talk about is the
approach offered by James Fadiman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now both scientists are seen as
visionaries in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it isn't our goal to really say one is
necessarily better than the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: These protocols usually involve taking a
combination of mushrooms and other
[SPEAKER_02]: supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when taken together, these different
components are known as a stack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people, you often hear people refer to
them as the Stamets stack or the Fadiman
[SPEAKER_02]: stack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to present each of them today
in such a way that you can weigh them for
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself and more importantly,
discuss them with other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Adam, would you please walk us through
the combination of substances that Paul
[SPEAKER_02]: Stamets suggests mushrooms be taken with
together as the Stamets microdose stack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, long live Paul Stamets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Stamets for president of the
universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Paul Stamets was the first one I've
heard of to come up with the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: stacking other functional mushrooms with
psilocybin while microdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he developed what's known as the
Stamets stack, which is stacking
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin with lion's mane and niacin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lion's mane is a mushroom that
increases neuroplasticity as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: neurogenesis, which is the same thing that
the psilocybin does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I again learned from Paul and I'm a
strong believer in stacking your lion's
[SPEAKER_00]: mane with the psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he added niacin as well,
which is an activation and flushing agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I've heard him speak about it,
he talks about the ability for the niacin
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring the mushrooms to the tips of the
fingers and the tips of the toes and to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it spread out really effectively
throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Stamets stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that stack, he developed his
protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protocol meaning what is the schedule for
days on and days off during the week that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to microdose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, one of the most important
things about microdosing is this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: something you do seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a Western medical model of
antidepressants every day for the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've developed protocols,
first starting with Dr. Faddam's protocol,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Paul Stamets was the second one
to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stamets protocol, he has two actually,
they're four days on, three days off,
[SPEAKER_00]: or five days on, two off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Dr. Faddam has asked him,
what's the difference between the
[SPEAKER_00]: protocols, his answer is it's the option
to give people flexibility, really more
[SPEAKER_00]: than anything, and not to lock into one
saying five, two is better, four,
[SPEAKER_00]: three is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the protocols that I recommend
often to the clients I work with is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Stamets protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I prefer the five, two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it works really well during the
week, Monday to Friday, you can take your
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend off or you can switch it out some
other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, whether you're doing five,
five days on, two days off, or four days
[SPEAKER_00]: on, three days off, it's a really great
protocol that Paul has developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's fascinating from these days off
is not only in large dose psychedelics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in small dose psychedelics,
there is a 48 hour effect or what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: an afterglow with the large dose journeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on your days off, after the substance
has built up in your system, you are still
[SPEAKER_00]: benefiting from the substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes your days off can be better
than your days on, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat fascinating compared to the
Western medical system and how their
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the Stamets protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the top of explaining the stack,
you described both the psilocybin and the
[SPEAKER_02]: lion's mane as causing neurogenesis,
which we talk about a lot on this show as
[SPEAKER_02]: far as how it works with the
endocannabinoid system and laying down new
[SPEAKER_02]: neural pathways and options and often
cleaning up the plaques that build up
[SPEAKER_02]: along the neural pathways as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question for you is, do we know that
the lion's mane and the psilocybin promote
[SPEAKER_02]: neurogenesis in different ways?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so many of the functions of
psilocybin we don't actually know yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of color can you add to that
about how the two of these work together
[SPEAKER_02]: to cause our brain to heal and grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure there aren't any
studies where they're stacking lion's mane
[SPEAKER_00]: and psilocybin and seeing the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Paul is hypothesizing off of
individual studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one being with lion's mane and
rats, where they were able to test the
[SPEAKER_00]: rats post-mortem and see neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that they have done similar
studies with rats and psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one just came out in the last few
weeks where the brains of rats that were
[SPEAKER_00]: given psilocybin a couple weeks post
before they're killed and studied had
[SPEAKER_00]: larger brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we don't have the studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think even though there might be a few
out there, but I think that this is more a
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis of what they believe is
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to talk a little bit about the
niacin flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked your explanation that the niacin
actually helps with the transport of
[SPEAKER_02]: moving the psilocybin around the body so
you get more of a full body experience of
[SPEAKER_02]: healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had never heard it described that
way, and I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the days in the mid-90s when I was
living more close to you in the Bay Area,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were all into smart drugs and
nootropics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And niacin flushes were popular for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would take a high enough dosage of
niacin that literally our skin would
[SPEAKER_02]: flush, would get red.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people would get a little itchy on
their skin, but mostly it just makes your
[SPEAKER_02]: face look really flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should people be expecting some flavor of
that with the amount that's recommended by
[SPEAKER_02]: Stamets, or is the amount of niacin much
lower than getting that niacin flush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you get the niacin flush,
that's an indication that you're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: too much niacin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the feedback that I get more
often than not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why I don't use niacin personally is
people have a difficult time finding an
[SPEAKER_00]: amount that does not cause that flushing
and redness and that type of feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's definitely something
that's reported often about niacin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though you don't use the niacin
yourself, and I'm not personally a fan of
[SPEAKER_02]: it myself either, do you know off the top
of your head what the prescribed niacin as
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the Stamets stack is, just so
people know it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to guess something like 50
milligrams, but don't listen to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just search the Stamets stack
online, or I think he gave a TED Talk on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube you can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the exact amount for niacin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe strongly in the stacking of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: FlowState has a proprietary blend where we
stack chaga, cordyceps, mataki,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lion's mane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feel like all of those mushrooms
are creating somewhat of an entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: effect like you see in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm someone who believes that
the whole plant of cannabis is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know everything that's going on
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't isolated much more than THC and
a few others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I feel like with these
mushrooms, there is something really
[SPEAKER_00]: special happening when you combine lion's
mane with psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something really special happening
when you add chaga for immunity and
[SPEAKER_00]: cordyceps for energy and stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I think that this will also be
the future of nootropic drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard Paul Stamets talk about how the
future of nootropics are these microdosing
[SPEAKER_00]: stacks and that he believes in the future,
you know, Silicon Valley firms will be
[SPEAKER_00]: battling over, you know, who's microdosing
and who's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those employees that are microdosing
will be more valuable to the companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I've seen it in my own life that
microdosing, in my opinion, grows the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain, makes you more creative,
blocks the default mode network,
[SPEAKER_00]: gets you out of the old rutted thinking
that you're used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling more energized and created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's amazing things going on in the
brain and the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really beneficial to add
other mushrooms to your regimen with the
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin when you microdose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we talk about the Fadman
protocol, let's go ahead and take our
[SPEAKER_02]: first short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is microdosing educator,
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Bramledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are an auto flowering cannabis
enthusiast, this event's for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Announcing the 2021 Auto Flower Cup,
August 6th, 7th, and 8th in Lillooup,
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington, just outside of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Presented by Camp Ruderalis, this
gathering has something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Auto Flower Cup competition,
of course, but it's so much more than
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a Stunden glass hookah lounge,
a pop-up magical butter chocolate shop,
[SPEAKER_02]: and waterfront marketplace with an array
of vendors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be an old school auto flower
competition with an auto flower seed swap,
[SPEAKER_02]: joint rolling competition, cannabis
cooking demos, solvent-less squishing
[SPEAKER_02]: demos, and late night documentary
screenings of both Doast and Fantastic
[SPEAKER_02]: Fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food will be lit too, including Chef
Sebastian Carrosi's award-winning classics
[SPEAKER_02]: like elk chili, Kobe beef kimchi dogs,
oyster po' boys, and razor clam chowder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy the campfire chili and oyster
chowder cook-off, wild oyster harvesting,
[SPEAKER_02]: mushroom foraging, and s'mores around the
campfires each night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each day there, Dan Jimmy of Mandalorian
will teach about auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there will be presentations on closet
cultivation and hunting for psilocybin
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: The competition is open to everyone,
commercial and home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a category for photo period
plants too, so check out
[SPEAKER_02]: TheAutoFlowerCup2021.com for those
details.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly, there will be plenty of cannabis
around, but due to state law, it won't be
[SPEAKER_02]: supplied by the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there will be easy public toking,
which is why this is a strictly over 21
[SPEAKER_02]: event.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can camp, rent a cabin, or stay at a
local Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glamping and RV packages are available
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to say that Shaping Fire is a
sponsor of the event, and I'll be there
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to connecting with other
auto flower fans like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get all the details at
TheAutoFlowerCup2021.com and follow the
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram at TheAutoFlowerCup2021.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll see you in August at Auto Flower
Cup when we bring the auto flower family
[SPEAKER_02]: together to celebrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking to home growers, patients,
and commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI Seeds at
[SPEAKER_02]: HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caleb Inspector and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_02]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of his lineage and the hard-earned
experience that comes from growing up
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long-time heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_02]: yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caleb, also known as Inspector and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle, is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains recreating them in new
[SPEAKER_02]: and interesting ways that you'll love as a
toker and a grower as well as offering you
[SPEAKER_02]: some surprises that will delight serious
seed traders and cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_02]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were here on Vashon Island and
everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_02]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_02]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_02]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_02]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_02]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes most of the plants life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_02]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_02]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaping Fire listeners can get 10% off any
size of Dynomyco on Amazon or dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_02]: by using the discount code shapingfire,
one word, no caps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_02]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is microdusting educator,
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Bramledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before the break, we were finishing up
with the Paul Stamets stack, and that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: stack of psilocybin, niacin, and lion's
mane, and then the protocol, which
[SPEAKER_02]: determines suggestions for how many days
to take it and then how many days to take
[SPEAKER_02]: a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Paul Stamets, because he is,
you know, a visionary and incredibly
[SPEAKER_02]: popular, that's often the first protocol
that people run into just because Paul
[SPEAKER_02]: Stamets is kind of everywhere as a
mushroom god.
[SPEAKER_02]: But James Fadiman is also wildly respected
among mushroom people, and he's an active
[SPEAKER_02]: teacher, well-spoken, and, you know,
pretty universally respected as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So his protocol is slightly different than
Paul's, and so I think it's well
[SPEAKER_02]: worthwhile to consider his and then kind
of compare and contrast them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's point you in that direction,
Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so before we compare it to Paul's
stack, if you'd please just take a moment
[SPEAKER_02]: and explain James Fadiman's stack and then
protocol, and then we'll do the comparison
[SPEAKER_02]: after.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and just a brief background on Dr.
Fadiman.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 13 years ago, he wrote a book called
The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was somewhat of a guide for people
who wanted to take large dose journeys and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to safely and effectively do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that book, it was the first time that
he mentioned microdosing, which was using
[SPEAKER_00]: small doses of psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: After writing that book, he began to get
hundreds of emails from people all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world telling him miracle stories
about how microdosing helped everything
[SPEAKER_00]: from shingles to, you name it,
just about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically where the modern
microdosing movement started was 13 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, with The Psychedelic Explorer's
Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Fadiman decided that he needed to come
up with a protocol for people on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: properly dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his idea and his protocol is one
day on, two days off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the idea behind this protocol when
talking to him is he said it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: research protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a protocol where he wants to
get you back to a baseline at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first day on is your microdose day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second day is your first day off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your afterglow day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your 48-hour effect day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still should be getting effects from
the microdose on your first day off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, your second day off, for research
purposes, is when you return to a baseline
[SPEAKER_00]: and are quote unquote sober.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, you should be
journaling as to the differences on your
[SPEAKER_00]: sober day as opposed to the differences on
your on day as opposed to the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: on your afterglow day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the idea behind was he wanted
people to reach back to a baseline on that
[SPEAKER_00]: third day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does James Fadiman recommend anything
else in his stack other than the
[SPEAKER_02]: psilocybin, for example, like the niacin
or the lion's mane or something else?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was just watching a new
podcast with Dr. Fadiman today and he
[SPEAKER_00]: believes strongly in the stacking of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not going to say per se
which one he approves of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, he definitely, I think,
believes in the stacking of mushrooms and
[SPEAKER_00]: what Paul's doing and what flow state is
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've definitely heard him
talk to that, but I'm not going to speak
[SPEAKER_02]: for him right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if he is doing a research protocol,
I like the idea that brings us back to a
[SPEAKER_02]: baseline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we also intuit into that,
that he's not necessarily suggesting that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a patient's healing protocol?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can we make that jump and say,
oh, you could use his research protocol as
[SPEAKER_02]: a patient protocol as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that lends us into a third and popular
protocol, which is the Microdosing
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute protocol developed out of
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's day on, day off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason they developed that
protocol is because they had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: clientele telling them that on that third
baseline day, they dropped back into their
[SPEAKER_00]: deep depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And would it be possible to dose again?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from there, this amazing group out
of the Netherlands developed the protocol
[SPEAKER_00]: of day on, day off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a protocol that we want to
start getting out there and making more
[SPEAKER_00]: popular with the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, there is no one protocol
that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, beyond the Fadiman protocol
and the Stamets protocol and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Microdosing Institute protocol,
what happens with most clients that I work
[SPEAKER_00]: with is after a month or two, they end up
developing their own protocol,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the intuitive protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be different from week to
week, and it might depend on their
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule or how they're feeling or what's
going on in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing that Dr. Fadiman
developed was the idea that you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: microdose for at least a month before you
decide whether or not it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are small changes
happening every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say baby steps are brick by
brick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I want to repeat to people that
you want to give yourself a minimum of a
[SPEAKER_00]: month before you decide the positives and
the negatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I suggest is maybe week one,
you try one protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week two, you try a different protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can really mess around with the
protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know for myself, having done
this for more than three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: there might be a month where I'm on a
Stamets protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next month, due to stressors
or things happening in my life,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might switch to the Microdosing
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protocol, which is day on, day off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, there are protocols
that we haven't even talked about when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working with clients that are weaning
heavy pharmaceuticals or are having
[SPEAKER_00]: addictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the fact that over the course
of the weaning product, there are rare
[SPEAKER_00]: cases where they might microdose seven
days a week just to help them with the
[SPEAKER_00]: withdrawal in the first few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, nobody is really
microdosing seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want a tolerance to build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want a mental thing building up
where you think you need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the days off tend to be just as
good, if not better, which is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating new medical model that we can
present to the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does it feel like to have a higher
tolerance?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most of us in cannabis know what
it feels like to build up a tolerance to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for folks who are trying to recognize
it with their microdosing, what are the
[SPEAKER_02]: signs that they can look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Signs they can look for is after a month
or two, they're noticing that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling as much of the effects that they
were feeling at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, what's really amazing with
psilocybin, in my personal opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is my opinion, is that it has a
fungal intelligence built in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people try to abuse it,
meaning people try to take it in large
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts too many times, it's going to take
those people on a very not fun journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they sober up, the last thing
they're going to think about is taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: large dose of psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar with the small doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people abuse it and they take it for
two or three months straight, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to work anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to build a tolerance and not be
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smoking three times a day for a
month, at the end of the month,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to take you more bong rips to
get higher than it did at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more than anything, I think that you're
probably just not getting as much as the
[SPEAKER_00]: positive benefits, which is uplift in
energy, uplift in mood, that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to ask you a question about
fungal intelligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that one of the reasons why to
hear how you talk about it will be very
[SPEAKER_02]: engaging to people is because you are a
clear spoken scientific person who
[SPEAKER_02]: understands the complexities of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of its complexity, sure,
there's a lot of mushroom stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: happens in the clinic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: But along the sides of the research of
mushrooms and the experience, there is
[SPEAKER_02]: this fungal intelligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so would you please just address that
for people who either haven't considered
[SPEAKER_02]: that part or people who really just
approach their mushrooms as a protocol and
[SPEAKER_02]: as raw science to perhaps open up a door
that there might be something extra going
[SPEAKER_02]: on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, anybody that hasn't seen
Fantastic Fungi, which you can check out
[SPEAKER_00]: on Amazon, which really breaks down
mushrooms and mycelium and even what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing at John Hopkins with
psilocybin treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really suggest checking that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the farther you dive into the hole of
mushrooms and fungus, the largest fossil
[SPEAKER_00]: ever found is, I believe, 800 million
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, what we're finding now is
that plants and animals derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not surprising that these
mushrooms heal us or help us or our tools
[SPEAKER_00]: or grow our brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, and other people talk
about this, I am by no means the creator
[SPEAKER_00]: of this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an intelligence to these plant
medicines, to these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry, but we're never going to be
able to figure out the levels of this
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence in a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not quantifiable, just not
trackable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beyond human brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I'm working with people,
I like to remind them that this isn't just
[SPEAKER_00]: a nootropic or a vitamin or a supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is a sacred tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remind them, first of all, that you are
the medicine, we are the medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is a tool that is going to help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there is an intelligence to
these mushrooms that I couldn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: properly put into words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people are humble and honest enough
to believe that and to try, I really feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's something that is not only going
to change people's inner workings,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of Paul Stamets,
and I agree with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the answers to global warming and
everything that we're facing right now is
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about mushrooms to eat up
plastic, mushrooms to eat up garbage,
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms to clean up Chernobyl and toxic
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also for our own personal health,
Paul Stamets figured out a way to use
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom extract to save the bees from bee
colony collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing he says about
microdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Stamets believes microdosing is how
we're going to crack the code to solving
[SPEAKER_00]: the problems of the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: He believes that by people microdosing
more often, creating new neural pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: and thinking outside of the default mode
network, that we're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: solve these problems that we haven't been
able to solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my personal opinion, that fungal
intelligence was part of the Mayan
[SPEAKER_00]: tradition, the Aztec, the Egyptian,
all of these traditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been using these mushrooms and
these plant medicines to get intelligence
[SPEAKER_00]: and figure out how to do many things from
probably building their pyramids to you
[SPEAKER_00]: name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there is an intelligence that
we're never going to be able to put into
[SPEAKER_00]: human words.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently saw a meme that I really
enjoyed and it said, psychedelics is
[SPEAKER_02]: nature trying to speak with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like that sentiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a lot of people who do
experiment with microdosing that may not
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately embrace the fungal
intelligence part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got friends who at the beginning
didn't really care about that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to microdose because they
write software and they wanted to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to envision the software differently and
see more big pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they started taking that to be better
at their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a couple months into it, you can see
them evolve into having some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: respect for the fungal intelligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of funny, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because regardless of who you are that you
bring to the psilocybin around your belief
[SPEAKER_02]: in fungal intelligence, it kind of gets
done to you anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm speechless right now because the long
and short of it is it has a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with everybody that it works
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am blown away day to day with how
many messages I get from clients that are
[SPEAKER_00]: improving their lives and improving their
lives in ways where now their wife mounts
[SPEAKER_00]: the microdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they want to get their daughter
microdosing and off of her
[SPEAKER_00]: antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just an amazing spiral of people
healing themselves and then helping others
[SPEAKER_00]: to heal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we go to our second break,
let's talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_02]: individualized medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've mentioned a couple times about
how people tend to get started and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: learning from somebody, whether it be a
friend or an educator or a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or wherever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they'll start following a protocol
that has been recommended to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time, they start to do the
intuitive protocol you called it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you talk a little bit about that
transition from a protocol that we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: taught to a protocol that we've designed
ourselves?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that working with as many
students as you have that you have perhaps
[SPEAKER_02]: a few best practices for adapting a
protocol you've been given into one that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've made yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond the protocols we know,
I also suggest for the clients that they
[SPEAKER_00]: stack some very important things in their
life like exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reduce the amount of alcohol,
little things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stacking of exercise I think is
actually hugely beneficial to people as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to mention that and I
forgot the end of the other question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for best practices for going
from a set protocol to an individualized
[SPEAKER_02]: intuitive protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, best practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I would say in that first month
that it's nice to try out the protocols
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been developed because they
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I see over time is after that
first month, people naturally get into
[SPEAKER_00]: this intuitive space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the same way that you talked about,
people naturally connect with the fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think microdosing makes people more
intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes people more competent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them follow their intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a natural occurrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that there's a SOP for how best
to create your own intuitive protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that is unique again to the
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might develop it in week
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might develop it in month
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more than anything, it's a natural
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't happen at the same time for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think developing an intuitive
protocol over time is something that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be powerful for the person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're asking people to stack
exercise, stack things like yoga,
[SPEAKER_00]: breath work, healthy diet, all kinds of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of things weighing in
to help out that microdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people tend to find that protocol on
their own over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that I'm coaching them in any way
how to find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I think that the microdosing
makes them more intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spoke of your friends that were taking
it to do better at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably somebody that should
microdose LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: LSD is really good for focus, for coding,
for staying on task, for being outward in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin's a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psilocybin's more inward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more giving you the ability to work
on yourself, to create, but it's not as
[SPEAKER_00]: focused outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I would just mention to
everybody is I see psilocybin microdosing
[SPEAKER_00]: as more of an inner journey, whereas LSD
is more of something people are using for
[SPEAKER_00]: focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, in Silicon Valley and
coding jobs where they need to stay up for
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 hours and think outside of the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last thing before we go to the second
set, I'm sure that you work with some
[SPEAKER_02]: people who have got trepidation,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually uncomfortable with all of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm very comfortable talking about
it now because we were doing this stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: recreationally back in college all those
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm pretty comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are a lot of people who approach
this as an adult and it's been demonized
[SPEAKER_02]: and taboo their whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do want relief or they do want to
connect with their spiritual side or for
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever draws them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming to this and they're reading
all this good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in their heart of hearts, they got
some trepidation.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you offer folks to kind of soothe
them and help them get their mindset
[SPEAKER_02]: correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like to remind people that
mushrooms don't know they're illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that somebody can tell us we
can't put something that grows naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: from God's green earth into our system is
kind of outrageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people have a really tough time with
the legality or the idea that a mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: is a drug, I tend to direct them to The
Immortality Key, a new book that just came
[SPEAKER_00]: out where they've basically proven that
back in Greek times they were doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: rite of passage that involved Yirgat,
which is where LSD came from, Socrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: Plato, democracy, theater, the Olympics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything developed out of these
psychedelic rites of passage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically when the Romans took over,
one of their leaders made it illegal for
[SPEAKER_00]: these ceremonies anymore and you're
punishable by death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within 20, 30 years, they basically
got it out of all of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we've proven it now is
they've been able to do DNA testing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: goblets that they've found in these
ancient altar sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've proven that they were tripping
in these ceremonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just remind people that saying that
mushrooms is a drug or illegal is more of
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's happened since 1972 when
Nixon created the whole idea of this drug
[SPEAKER_00]: war.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just try to ease their tension on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what, to be honest with you,
if somebody's really worried about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they're ready, they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't like to force anything on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Fadiman likes to say if anyone asks
him if they should do a large dose
[SPEAKER_00]: journey, he says no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they say, why do you say no?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, because if you have to ask me
if you should do it, you're not ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are all kinds of different ways
to look at things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are listening while you're
driving or riding your bike or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you want to remember the immortality
key book, there'll be a link to it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: shaping fire website when you get back to
your computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, let's go ahead and take our
second short break.
[SPEAKER_02]: And be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is microdosing educator
Adam Bramledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I love growing under the sun,
there's a lot of good reasons to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're like most folks,
you want a lighting source that grows high
[SPEAKER_02]: yielding, healthy plants without using
excessive amounts of electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: BIOS lighting creates biological lighting
solutions that brings the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: brilliance of the outdoors into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: BIOS lighting has the attributes that I
look for in a home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Horticultural lighting solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've bought those cheap lights online and
they're difficult to work with and fail in
[SPEAKER_02]: no time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In contrast, my BIOS LED light is
industrial grade to last a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is IP 66 wet rated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So little foliar overspray won't harm it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is easy to clean without taking it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the most important aspect,
it is built for the exact light spectrum I
[SPEAKER_02]: want for great yielding, healthy cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't hurt that their lighting
rigs look bad ass too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many horticultural LED lighting systems
are based on irrelevant performance
[SPEAKER_02]: metrics and people love to argue online
about these numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to judge on par photon efficiency
and how happy my plants are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the BIOS lights exceed my expectations
in these categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: BIOS lights have an optimized broad
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_02]: plant growth while also providing the
ideal conditions for superior par efficacy
[SPEAKER_02]: and a comfortable visual experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also love their attentive and
overeducated customer service folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: BIOS starts with a team of biologists
before getting the electrical engineers
[SPEAKER_02]: involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have studied how light impacts
cannabis plants and devised an overall
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage you to check out their website

[SPEAKER_02]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_02]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_02]: ornamental plant industry and today many
cannabis cultivators are moving from
[SPEAKER_02]: sprays and chemicals to beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Copert Biological Systems has the
beneficial insects, mites and nematodes,
[SPEAKER_02]: microbials, sticky cards and air
distribution units you need to partner
[SPEAKER_02]: with nature to defend your garden.

[SPEAKER_02]: With the national hemp program influx due
to stringent THC testing requirements,
[SPEAKER_02]: brothers Seth and Eric Crawford continue
to release seeds to hemp farmers that will
[SPEAKER_02]: be legal, no matter how you grow them or
when you test them.
[SPEAKER_02]: These new varieties from Oregon CBD seeds
have substantial amounts of CBDV,
[SPEAKER_02]: CBGV, CBCV and THCV while always staying
below the 0.3% THC limit and guaranteeing
[SPEAKER_02]: complying crops for farmers every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, these new varieties cannot be
pollinated by your neighbor's uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen or a rogue male in your own crop
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon CBD seeds are non-GMO certified
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon CBD seeds was founded and funded in
2015 by Seth and Eric maxing out their
[SPEAKER_02]: personal credit cards without outside
investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They continued to refuse outside
investment that would change their company
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon CBD grows tons of fresh food on
their research farms for local food banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally tons of food.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also give away tens of thousands of
pounds of R&D flour to patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: As their company began to succeed,
Seth and Eric started donating money to
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause
too by giving millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon State University in order to
establish the world's leading cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: genomics research program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they treat their employees right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon CBD pays for full health and dental
coverage for their employees, a 401k
[SPEAKER_02]: program and their minimum starting wage is
20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus everyone shares food from the farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth has been on shaping fire a few times
to talk about novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check out episodes 25 and 37 on
CBD cultivars and the hemp market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 66 on triploid cannabis genetics
and the very first shaping fire live
[SPEAKER_02]: episode 47 with Seth and soil expert Jeff
Lowenfels talking about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a hemp farmer and you want to
grow reliable seeds that are sure to
[SPEAKER_02]: thrive in past testing, check out
oregoncbdseeds.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_02]: buying seeds for the 2021 season.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's oregoncbdseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Shango Los and our guest
this week is microdosing educator,
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Bramledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So regardless of what protocol you decide
to go with in your journey, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: most people run into the same handful of
challenges or or attributes of microdosing
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's good to know about your
possibility of running into them in
[SPEAKER_02]: advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've made a short list of things that
people have asked me about or I've
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced with psilocybin and we're
going to go through those with Adam now so
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, you can have a full
picture of what this looks like and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can know what you might run into and
you'll have some solutions in advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Adam, I think that one of the biggest
issues that we have for folks are people
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get the right dosage and during
the first set, you know, we talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: the starting low and increasing slowly and
people probably get that, but I mean like
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically measuring doses to make sure
that you get the proper amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: These weights that we're talking about are
very specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you recommend to your clients
to make sure that they are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the dose that they're trying to
get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're microdosing to all the
listeners out there, you need to go get
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself a nice digital scale,
something small that reads in the tenths
[SPEAKER_00]: and the hundredths of a gram and we need
to stop just nibbling little pieces off
[SPEAKER_00]: the stem and the cap and we need to really
document how much we're taking so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: know what's our effective dose because
again, it's unique for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you're going to want a coffee
grinder because what you're going to want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do is you're going to want to grind up
the dried fruiting body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to make sure that
that dried fruiting body is cracker dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to make sure there's any
moisture or mold that could grow within
[SPEAKER_00]: these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's cracker dry, you blend it up
into a powder and then you're literally
[SPEAKER_00]: weighing out and if you're concerned,
if you're someone who has a low tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: for substances, then maybe you start out
at 25 milligrams and that means that's
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.025 on a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very, very small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then recommend that you get a capsule
and you put it in a capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a lot easier on your stomach
if it's in a capsule than just putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: on your tongue, maybe even a smoothie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is probably the best way to do it
but we really need to take the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: the care to get a scale to weigh it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest grinding it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I think grinding it up helps is I
think it breaks it down a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: for your system and it's already more
broken down and more available for you
[SPEAKER_00]: than if you were just to munch the
fruiting body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my biggest suggestion is getting
that scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, 50 milligrams is probably the good
place to start for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really concerned, the lowest
I've ever heard still having an effect is
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a regular psychonaut and you're
like 50, just doesn't sound like a big
[SPEAKER_00]: enough number for me, start at 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once people start getting over 200
milligrams, it's usually not a microdose
[SPEAKER_00]: for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have a higher tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people might think that 200
milligram to 400 milligram is that mini
[SPEAKER_00]: dose range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it is for me and that's another way
that you could use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to start slow,
you start low and go slow, you need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to grind it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make sure that everything is
crack or dry and be logging it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day one, I took 25 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: No effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day two, I took 50 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noticed improvement in my mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are all things that people
need to take upon themselves and really
[SPEAKER_00]: get scientific about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody receives their mushrooms and
they are not bone dry, is it as simple as
[SPEAKER_02]: just leaving the Ziploc bag open in a cool
dark place for a few days and just letting
[SPEAKER_02]: them dry out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or should we use something more specific
than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it all depends on your
environment and where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what to do, I know some people will
even use it to hydrate or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the best thing to do is,
yeah, keep the bag open, keep it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: place where it breathes and it gets air.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are packets you can add that help
suck the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even see them in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different ways and
things you can do to get the last of that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when measuring doses, there is one more
variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the fact that there are a lot
of doses of different types of psilocybin
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms that contain psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have differentiating potencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I normally act like, unless I'm having
penis envy mushrooms, I just assume that
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else is pretty much gonna be
the same and I just dose as I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is there something more sophisticated
than that that we should be aware of for
[SPEAKER_02]: adjusting our dosing weight?
[SPEAKER_02]: To the potency of the mushroom variety
that we are taking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a few mushroom varieties out
there that are way more potent than
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, penis envy is the big name that
I'm always hearing and talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't know that penis envy is a
good one for everyone to microdose because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I took one time what I thought was
a penis envy microdose and it turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: a full on large dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you're gonna microdose with
penis envy, I'm guessing you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very small amounts and you should be
more careful than with other varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I believe it's cyanescence and
asserenza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a couple other varieties
that grow wild that are super,
[SPEAKER_00]: super strong and potent too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't even eat them for large
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the internet is a great
resource to check out all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and what they're good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, most people that I'm
working with, I'm suggesting that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using a very mellow and stable variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are using golden teachers,
you know, Thai, Burmese, couple different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But penis envy and the stronger end
mushrooms are probably mushrooms you would
[SPEAKER_00]: want to save for the large dose journeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I know there are groups out there
that do like to microdose with the penis
[SPEAKER_00]: envy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you need to be aware that some
varieties of psilocybe are much stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a good argument too for
knowing your source as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a good sign when the person
that you're receiving the mushrooms from
[SPEAKER_02]: can also tell you the variety and,
you know, feel like they're closish to the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because while there isn't nearly the kind
of abuse with mushrooms as there are with
[SPEAKER_02]: different sorts of intoxicants and other
drugs, it's still good to be close to your
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer, both energetically and so that you
can be aware of what the variety is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when I was in cannabis as a farmer,
you know, we used to always say,
[SPEAKER_00]: know your farmer, know your medicine and
where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same with your mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think the easiest way to do
it is to grow it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are really amazing programs out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ways that for, you know, 50 to $100,
people can grow their own mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a relationship with the fungus and
grow enough under their bed in a shoebox
[SPEAKER_00]: to supply them for a full year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way to really do it is to
learn how to do it yourself and know
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly where it's coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not set up in a place to do
that, yeah, you absolutely have to know
[SPEAKER_00]: who's doing it, how it's working,
should be vetted, that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're getting it from somebody and
he can't tell you whether it's Penis Envy
[SPEAKER_00]: or a Thai variety or Burmese or what it
is, then you probably shouldn't get it
[SPEAKER_00]: from that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really fantastic to see so many home
cultivation classes showing up all over
[SPEAKER_02]: the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't taken enough of them to
compare one to another, but I'm just glad
[SPEAKER_02]: to see the access to that information is,
I mean, hell, nearly ubiquitous now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, people always talk to me
as someone who pivoted out of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, aren't you worried about big pharma
and what about corporation coming in and
[SPEAKER_00]: privatizing psilocybin?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, again, it's almost laughable
because the reality is everybody can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: their own mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big pharma, big capital, big corporations,
they can't stop people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't stop the power of these
mushrooms, the ability to educate
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody how to grow these on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing mushrooms in your home is
easier than growing cannabis for eight
[SPEAKER_00]: months out in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the long and short of it is before we
legalize and make it available for
[SPEAKER_00]: companies like my own to provide you
microdosing products, we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalize first, which means we need
to give everybody at home the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, gift and gather their own mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're allowed to legally grow your own
mushrooms and provide them to your friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and family, then you don't have to go to
the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the overpriced psilocybin and then
big corporation and big pharma doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have that power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm not worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most important thing moving
forward is that we decriminalize before we
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of your listeners out there who
are interested in this decriminalized
[SPEAKER_00]: nature is a great group to get involved
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we need to continue to
decriminalize so that people aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: persecuted and put in jail if they can't
afford to buy the legal products here
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about tummy aches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly with larger doses, macro doses,
tummy aches and nausea as the fruiting
[SPEAKER_02]: body of the mushroom is processed in the
gut really is uncomfortable for a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first experimented with with
microdosing at at point one, I figured,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, it's such a small amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't feel any nausea at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet I still feel a little bit of
constriction in my gut and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people experience it even more
than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious to know what your
experiences with both how common nausea is
[SPEAKER_02]: at these local low micro doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have any tips or tricks for
decreasing that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, can I ask you first, did you blend
up your dose and was it in a capsule or
[SPEAKER_00]: were you taking it on the tongue and
tasting it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How were you ingesting?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a non blended up point one put in a
capsule.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a there was a firm,
small mushroom body in the capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, OK, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, for me and I suggest
again, between the hundred and hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: fifty ish milligram range.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people starting, I don't get a lot of
reports of tummy aches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the suggestion is to grind it
up and put it in a capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest taking it with with food,
you know, having some food in your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was there food in your system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually taught to take it on an
empty stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a myth that I got, you know,
in college all those years ago that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: right anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you speak more to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not that it's not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that there's plenty of
people that take it on an empty stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm someone that intermittent fasts
almost daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really do breakfast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm also kind of taking an empty
stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend taking an empty stomach
for anyone that doesn't want to maybe get
[SPEAKER_00]: rushes of feeling more of a mini dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you don't have food in your
system, it's going to hit you harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in college, the reason that we
weren't trying to eat is we wanted to trip
[SPEAKER_00]: harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to feel we wanted to feel it
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I suggest that most people,
if their routine is to have food in their
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach in the morning, then they need to
have food in their stomach in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it could help them feel uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is, I think these other
mushrooms that you stack together,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the flow state blend,
when we stack chaga and cordyceps and
[SPEAKER_00]: mitaki, which chaga and mitaki are good
for the immune system, I think that those
[SPEAKER_00]: also help with the nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't get any reports from my
clients with an upset stomach,
[SPEAKER_00]: nor do I hear much about an upset stomach
with the pulse dammit stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the upset stomach could be an
issue of maybe no food in your belly,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe even your microdose is a little
too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for people that just have an
aversion to psilocybin, and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: always giving them a tummy ache,
again, after capsulizing it and grinding
[SPEAKER_00]: it up, maybe take it with some ginger and
have a ginger tea or eat a ginger chew or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, and get some ginger
into your system to potentially help your
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: After hearing that little bit,
it's like I stacked the wrong things to
[SPEAKER_02]: do, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like I didn't grind the
mushroom, I took it on an empty stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like, all right, this is
going to be, oh, and I didn't stack it
[SPEAKER_02]: with other healthy mushrooms, even though
I have five defenders in my house,
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought to put them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could radically change my
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about significant sensitivity
to psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because while it's a very, very small
number of people, there are people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: hyper sensitive, and would you talk a
little bit about, you know, how common
[SPEAKER_02]: that is, just to reinforce the start slow,
because I find that the finding for people
[SPEAKER_02]: to start low and slow is one of the
hardest things to get folks to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think if you've never taken a
psychedelic before, you're absolutely the
[SPEAKER_00]: person we're talking to when we say start
low and go slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for those of us that have had
more experiences, you've got more room for
[SPEAKER_00]: error, you can handle it if that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that large dose experience kicks in,
or the mini dose, you might actually strap
[SPEAKER_00]: on your seatbelt and enjoy the ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for beginners, you really got to take
your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these psychedelics, even in small
amounts, are nonspecific amplifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason so much healing,
in my opinion, happens with the
[SPEAKER_00]: microdosing of psilocybin is all of the
traumas or emotions or things that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: buried, maybe even since childhood that we
have failed to deal with, are brought to
[SPEAKER_00]: light, almost like a spotlight is shined
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't hide it anymore,
and you're forced to deal with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're forced to do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why so many people are
benefiting from this microdosing of
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin, especially in regards to
helping many of my clients get off of 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: even 30 years at times of antidepressants
and anti-anxieties and every pill under
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun that you can think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we mentioned at the top that you are
not a medical doctor, and we always
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend that people talk to their
doctors before going down these paths.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, you've got a doctor that
you can be this frank with, even though
[SPEAKER_02]: most of us don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I say this just to set up the
question, Adam, are there any particular
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-existing conditions that suggest that
you should not be taking psilocybin
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms as a microdose?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that we already know
that is contraindicated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, microdosingpsychedelics.com is a great
website that Dr. Fadiman put together that
[SPEAKER_00]: has all those contraindications and all
the different medications, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're developing through the more
than 1,500 reports that he's gotten over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I just went blank, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the question again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we were talking about pre-existing
contraindications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, contraindications, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as far as pre-existing
contraindications, we've gotten reports,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I should say Dr. Fadiman's gotten
reports that lithium is a medication that
[SPEAKER_00]: you should not combine with microdosing,
as well as a rare form of, I believe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow, blue, or some kind of color
blindness, where people have reported for
[SPEAKER_00]: a few days after microdosing, they're
still seeing light tracers, which isn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that people get from taking large
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's fascinating is there aren't really
any reported contraindications to dates
[SPEAKER_00]: with antidepressants and many different
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for me, that's what is so exciting
about the future, is that these can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used as tools to help people wean off of
other supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I'm working with clients that
are weaning off of drugs for many years,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is also involving their doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to their doctor first and they ask
for a weaning protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'll tell you is majority of the
doctors don't have a weaning protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how to get you on a medication,
but they have no clue how to get you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, you have to go to your doctor
first and let them know you want to wean
[SPEAKER_00]: these medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ask them for a protocol, you ask them
for a safe and effective way, and you take
[SPEAKER_00]: it very, very slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, weaning off of medications with
microdosing is something that people
[SPEAKER_00]: should do with assistance with somebody
who's guided other people from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you could do it on your own as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm excited for the future
aspect of helping people get off of other
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs and other substances like alcohol,
tobacco, heroin, pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you mentioned earlier you recommended
journaling, and we recommend journaling a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot on this show, both for finding out
what cultivars of cannabis flowers you
[SPEAKER_02]: like or if you're doing a high potency
cannabis oil protocol for cancer or some
[SPEAKER_02]: other chronic disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Journals are very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you recommend that your clients
put in their microdosing journal?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why do you tell them that they should
have one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's really subtle changes when
you're working with microdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people come into microdosing
and they want that home run grand slam on
[SPEAKER_00]: their first dose like they get from a
large dose journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for me, the journaling is to help them
notice the subtle things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to help them look back at their day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I more recommend in my practice that
people journal before bed as a reflection
[SPEAKER_00]: on their day and how their day went.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I find is when I have follow up
conversations with them, they start the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation a lot of times with,
yeah, it was a pretty good week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't notice that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, all right, well,
share with me your journal from Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they read me their journal and then
they're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, wait, actually there
were huge, huge improvements this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the journaling more than anything is
to connect them with themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: to connect them with where they want to
focus and where their days went.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also at the end of the month,
something that they can look back on and
[SPEAKER_00]: notice that they made giant leaps over the
course of a month, but they were simply in
[SPEAKER_00]: baby steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Adam, I really appreciate you
sharing all of your experience with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your field is just like, well,
I guess cannabis is your field too,
[SPEAKER_02]: but both of these fields suffer from a lot
of bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the good things about this
increasing normalization is that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: able to speak more freely with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got this episode that people are
gonna be able to listen to and then talk
[SPEAKER_02]: to their friends and family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this information is being able to be
spread in ways that, well, not only are
[SPEAKER_02]: more free, but where we can really develop
expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it's a wonderful for you to
join me on the show today so that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: discuss something within your expertise
and hopefully get rid of some of the myths
[SPEAKER_02]: and replace them with science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most important thing we did years ago in
cannabis was re-educating people,
[SPEAKER_00]: was teaching them the truth and myth
busting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing we have to do in
psychedelics is re-educate and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: path we're on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you very much.
