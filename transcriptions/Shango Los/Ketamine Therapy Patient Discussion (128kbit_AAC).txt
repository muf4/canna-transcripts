[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, I am here today with Tyler
Markwart, who's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a longtime cannabis cultivator and
hash maker, but today we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about something totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tyler and I have been friends for a long
time and he has recently completed a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of sessions of ketamine under a
doctor's care, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like legal official ketamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of ketamine you got from a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to talk about that a little
bit because ketamine therapy, to my
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge, is pretty new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to come across somebody who has done a
full round of it and is also, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: has got a recreational drug background,
so to share some of our vocabulary,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that would be really interesting
to hear about it from somebody who's
[SPEAKER_00]: already a psychonaut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tyler, thank you so much for taking
some time this morning and chatting with
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's figure out, you know,
I know that you were aware of ketamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us who have done exploration with
drugs generally know that ketamine exists
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a horse tranquilizer and
people joke about K-holes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point you were reintroduced to
it as a medicine, something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: thought was going to help offer you some
kind of relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you lay that out for us and kind
of like let us know what attracted you to,
[SPEAKER_00]: let alone getting a doctor's help and
getting ketamine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was born with a genetic liver
disorder and IBS and that had caused
[SPEAKER_01]: serious depression and anxiety
specifically with food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every time you eat food it causes
intestinal spasms and other issues that
[SPEAKER_01]: are very detrimental and hard to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to become forcing yourself to
basically eat food and you get anxiety
[SPEAKER_01]: every time you eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the last 38 years of dealing with
this, it just kind of built and built and
[SPEAKER_01]: built and got worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I had gotten arrested in 2011 and
convicted for a court trial for running a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana dispensary and that just
kind of added to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the depression hit really, really hard
and then I needed something to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: help with that because regular
psychotherapy wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exercise wasn't doing it and I needed
something to really push myself beyond the
[SPEAKER_01]: level of what society was giving me with
basic psychotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that we'd normally go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you knew you were depressed and you
wanted things to change and you tried
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy and clearly you tried weed and
exercise and you're going down the list
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're like none of this stuff is
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ketamine is kind of an atypical
response to depression, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what turned you on to that as being a
solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: So being on Instagram and a couple other
places, social media sites, I had good
[SPEAKER_01]: connections with other psychonauts and
doctors and started doing research about
[SPEAKER_01]: what options there were out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of ours, Allison Drason,
who works at the clinic that I went to,
[SPEAKER_01]: she had posted something about the therapy
being available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of sparked my interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had tried ketamine once before as a
teenager and did not enjoy the experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: was not ready for it or whatever the deal
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I never really thought about it or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then started doing more research into,
there's a book called The Ketamine Papers,
[SPEAKER_01]: which kind of lays out a bunch of
different experiments that were done over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I read that a little bit and just
became a little bit more interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really got to the point where the
depression was so heavy, I was suicidal
[SPEAKER_01]: and just really struggling to deal with
moving forward in life because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach issues and other stuff that was
related to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I end up just being like, you know
what, I'm just gonna give this a try and
[SPEAKER_01]: if it works, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't, then I get to have a
psychomagic experience for a couple hours
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it did, it really changed my life
after the sessions were done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you originally read about ketamine
as a potentially providing relief for
[SPEAKER_00]: depression, how was it described to you
that got your attention and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this is something I had not considered
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the ketamine supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting because some of the
papers had said there was a female
[SPEAKER_01]: individual patient who was struggling with
depression anxiety and she had taken one
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment and was cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: From her issues after one treatment and I
was like, wow, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, of course, the paper said,
now this is not, not all patients are like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other patients do require other lengthier
treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some patients don't respond to the
treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like any other pharmaceutical,
it's like cannabis, you know, one may work
[SPEAKER_01]: for somebody and it may not work well for
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the people that it does work well
and it seems like it works well for a
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of the people, it does make a
major change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was very much interested in like,
it's either gonna change or I'm gonna kill
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty much where it came down
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was homeless, living in my car and like,
you know, just trying to figure out where
[SPEAKER_01]: my next step was because the biggest issue
with the digestive tract issue is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to spend a majority of my money on
food and not just McDonald's or like fast
[SPEAKER_01]: foods or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be good food that has nutritious
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was like a majority of the issue
of where I was headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I need either change now or
we end this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I figured, hey, let's give this one
last chance and see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had tried microdosing psilocybin,
but struggled with the digestive tract
[SPEAKER_01]: issues of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't something that really worked
well for me on a day to day basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this seemed like it was you go in for
the session, the session is over and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you go back to life and it's maybe a slow
gradual build back up, but it'll get you
[SPEAKER_01]: where you need to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that became very interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, it was more just like,
we give this a try or we end it and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I tried committing suicide a couple
of times because of the digestive tract
[SPEAKER_01]: issues once as a teenager and then once in
my twenties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like, you know, this is,
I'm just getting tired of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tired of waking up every morning in
pain, tired of like having to like relieve
[SPEAKER_01]: myself from in a situation to go to the
bathroom or do something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just became mentally exhausting and
physically exhausting as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something had to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either I get better or I go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about what it's like,
because very likely there are other people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are listening who are depressed or
have one of the other attributes that
[SPEAKER_00]: ketamine can be used for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all like, but what a weird
visit that's got to be going into an
[SPEAKER_00]: office asking for potentially
hallucinogenic doses of ketamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that you went to Dr. Sunil
Agarwal's clinic who has been on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've had to speak many
times because Sunil is great, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were kind of encouraged to come in
by our mutual friend, Allison Drayson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you already kind of knew the people
involved with the clinic, but will you
[SPEAKER_00]: remind us of the name of the clinic,
where it is and essentially like what your
[SPEAKER_00]: first experience was going in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Ames Institute is located in
Seattle on East Lake, and it's an easily
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible place to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people who work there are all
wonderful people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going into that office really makes you
feel like you have the potential to change
[SPEAKER_01]: your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is super caring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is super calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a wonderful ambiance in the
office.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very inviting when you go in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a cold, sterile doctor's office
kind of feel, which was very something
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was pretty much always against.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't want to have to take Western
medicine to like, you know, deal with it
[SPEAKER_01]: because it usually causes other problems
or something of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at their website, you can tell
that this is going to be a different
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they, I don't remember it exactly,
but it says something like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: ketamine therapy, cannabis therapy,
psychedelics therapy, and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I like this menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not exactly like popping into
your regular doctor's office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you go in and have a ketamine
experience your first time or was there
[SPEAKER_00]: like intake first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there's an intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of get you prepared and they
want to go through to see like kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: what your experiences are with psychedelic
experiences so that they know,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, are you prepared for what's going to
happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever had something like this
before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you've never had that
experience before and this is your first
[SPEAKER_01]: time in that setting, it could be very,
very overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because you're not in a comfortable
setting that you know, you're not in your
[SPEAKER_01]: house or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are accustomed to these kinds of
experiences, psychedelic experiences,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will definitely have an easier walking
into the office to understanding of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the actual ketamine sessions
themselves are taking place in such a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that you feel extremely comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make you feel very, they offer the
opportunity for comfort there in a variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the sessions take place in like a
reclining chair where they'll put like a
[SPEAKER_01]: weighted blanket on you, keep you warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll also run aromatherapy in the
office as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have very warming kind of smells
when you come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they also introduce music,
which is kind of like a instrumental
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastern style of music that's very calming
and relaxing and helps you get into that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of transient state.
[SPEAKER_01]: That added with, I think a broad variety
of different types of music that you can
listen to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they also offer these blindfolds,
which was developed by Alex Gray,
[SPEAKER_01]: who is an artist and psycho not probably
these most well-known psycho not outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the group here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are very interesting in the fact
that they're raised and the insides are
[SPEAKER_01]: cut out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it allows you to open your eyes while
the blackout action is still happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll increase the effect, the visual
effects of the ketamine, which is a very
[SPEAKER_01]: important part of the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I want to toss in here,
just to shift the pronouns that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using at this point, because since you're
moving into telling us what your ketamine
[SPEAKER_00]: experience was like for you, I want to be
clear that this is not a commercial for
[SPEAKER_00]: the clinic or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we're talking about this is
that I wanted us to be able to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: Tyler's experience first person so that
any of us who also want to get involved
[SPEAKER_00]: can find this kind of care wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, let's shift it from what
the Ames Institute did for you to versus
[SPEAKER_00]: like I.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like what was going on for you,
because I think that your story will be
[SPEAKER_00]: told in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the day that you first went for an
in-office ketamine experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: which so did you know it was going to be
hallucinogenic before you started?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a feeling that it would probably be
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize how intense it would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I've done a fair amount of
hallucinogens before, so I knew the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you first told me about it that
you were going to get involved with this
[SPEAKER_00]: almost a year ago, I was thinking like
K-hole, like paralysis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were just going to be in your
head and kind of frozen, and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you first described this
story that you're about to tell us,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all like, what the hell, dude,
this is not at all what I thought we were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you thought that you might hallucinate,
but mostly you just wanted to check out
[SPEAKER_00]: this new, I don't know, trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, trip therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, legalize that, you know,
or allowed access for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so the experience, I sat down
into this reclining chair that they
[SPEAKER_01]: provided for me and put the blankets on
and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an inner muscular injection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got the injection into my shoulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I am a slightly different wire than
most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people generally are kind of in an
anesthetic state and they just lay there
[SPEAKER_01]: for the hour and a half time period and
kind of just soak in the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, I am a very wild child and was
like flailing everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I almost fell out of the chair during
the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So onto the second experience,
they moved me to the floor on a mattress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit safer, I think,
for everybody here, because I almost
[SPEAKER_01]: punched the nurse in the face apparently
at one point too, because she came over to
[SPEAKER_00]: help and I was like, run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're flailing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If most people get really sedated,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just lay there and they have this
mental experience that is healing while
[SPEAKER_00]: they are in this sedated state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why were you flailing around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you having like active hallucinations
that you were responding to or were you
[SPEAKER_00]: just like feeling like, oh, I've got ants
in my bloodstream?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the nature of your flailing,
I guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way it worked was when they give
you the injection, I got the injection
[SPEAKER_01]: right into the arm and they put it in and
it's within maybe 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Immediately, you start feeling warm in
your arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you smell the ketamine,
which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then within 15 seconds, you start
drifting off slowly into another
[SPEAKER_01]: dimension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a rocket shot into another
dimension, but it is an out-of-body
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do leave your person and go
somewhere else in your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like dimethyltryptamine,
like DMT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much like DMT in that sense,
except for with DMT, you seem to just all
[SPEAKER_01]: of a sudden be rocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is that rocket shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a much more like you're on
maybe like a magic carpet or a cloud and
[SPEAKER_01]: being brought up to like on an escalator
to like the next dimension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the softness of it is really nice for
somebody who maybe isn't used to that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of DMT like jet fuel experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get there, it is a very DMT
like experience where there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: moving shapes and colors, a lot of sound
of grinding and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A very intense overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the issues I think I had with the
flailing and stuff like that is because of
[SPEAKER_01]: my liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I process drugs very differently than
other people because of that liver enzyme
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to take the ketamine,
it may give you an experience that's
[SPEAKER_01]: longer and more stable, whereas I get a
very hard, intense experience for a
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter duration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my liver is just like,
take it all, let's take everything in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This seems great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that seems to be a bit of an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had to adjust some of the things
for the second treatment for that as well
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like put you on the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: First treatment was a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they try to figure out where you are to
gauge you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the heaviness of the trip is
the most important part because it really
[SPEAKER_01]: resets your brain and it really resets you
to becoming accepting of problems as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to being like, there's nothing we
can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This problem is going to ruin me,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You end up becoming more like this is a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how do we solve it kind of issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after the first treatment,
I felt slightly better, less depressed,
[SPEAKER_01]: not 100% pulled off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I felt like I had shifted the paradigm
to be facing somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though you were flailing,
would you call it fun?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would call it fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people may call it a terrifying
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it depends on how you like to view
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have always enjoyed psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably one of my preferred drugs of
choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, cannabis being a hallucinogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think for me, it was a more
comfortable experience because I was used
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it could be slightly terrifying for
somebody who's not used to that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, one of those things is it's
terrifying because it's changing you
[SPEAKER_01]: internally.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what the nurse told me was there's a
ring in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, obviously, I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to probably pronounce this
or do this correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a ring of cellular structures
in your head that basically ketamine
[SPEAKER_01]: rewires.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has to do with depression and
anxiety and then associates with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it literally rewires the connections
in those portions of the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that may happen slowly over a
multiple period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it took a few months for that to
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can feel the change happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You come out of the experience very
confused at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: The come down is a little bit confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you work yourself out of that after
about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do need somebody to pick you up
afterwards because you're not able to
[SPEAKER_01]: drive or do anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that reminds me a lot going back to
DMT, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because folks who have not tried something
like DMT, it's not like psilocybin or
[SPEAKER_00]: something where you take something and
you're like, my first person conscious
[SPEAKER_00]: personality is still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's something on top of that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the hallucinogen on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're still essentially walking
around being you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas drugs like DMT and ketamine,
it's more like you take your human,
[SPEAKER_00]: you unplug from reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your first person consciousness is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you plug into another reality which is
totally foreign and yet somehow familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're there for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you unplug from that reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly now you're back in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really strange experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably every time that you experience
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was certainly the first couple
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're wiped out just from having such
an intensity experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you are ready to nap for days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afterwards, just stop for about six hours
after each session.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that six hour rest, you're
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're back on your feet again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no issues or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be overwhelming for some folks who
are new to the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a crucial part of the
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without that part, I think you wouldn't be
able to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I want to dive in a little
bit more is during the experience while
[SPEAKER_00]: you are, let's say, checked out,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not having your first person Tyler
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet you have memories of what was
happening during your ketamine trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some part of your brain is certainly
running and really busy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound like spooky to some people,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, maybe even that's
legitimate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's some pretty intense stuff
that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But will you talk a little bit more about
what that was like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you're not conscious, but things are
happening in your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you just talk to that weirdness?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mask really kind of enhances
everything when you wear the face mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at one point, I accidentally
knocked the face mask off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see everybody in the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That must have been startling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was horrible, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the individuals don't look like
they should look.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're hallucinating characters on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they're melting or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to get the mask back on
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the mask is on, it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in this environment where it's
almost like the environment around you
[SPEAKER_01]: that you see is shifting like a
kaleidoscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bunch of colors and shapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colors and shapes are coming out of the
dimension that you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're moving and shifting almost
like a Rubik's Cube would kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may see like a square color,
four or five colors come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a square shape and then shift into a
circle and then move back into the
[SPEAKER_01]: background of what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people experience an entity or a
person or a face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have any experiences like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is essentially your brain just
freestyling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though there are themes to it,
like the gyrating geometrics and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, I would think that it's pretty
personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are consistencies through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do see a lot of sacred geometry stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see shapes that you would see
paintings of and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do go look at Alex Gray's
paintings, those are excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: representations of what the experience is
like, colorful-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: He often shows a lot of people and you'll
see their insides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't particularly see people or their
insides.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the concept of the colors and the
beyond third dimensional look that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to his paintings are very similar to what
you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are other artists out there but
he is obviously the most successively well
[SPEAKER_01]: known.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that experience is visually
overwhelming for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was for me too the first time I did
it because you are getting a fair amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of ketamine in your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you then become used to it by the set.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what you're getting yourself into
at round two and round three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you're not in control at all,
at least you know what's coming down the
[SPEAKER_00]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is leading to a better change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do feel the change afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the change is like using
baseball.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may hit a home run and it changes
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes you have to hit four singles
to score a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the same thing goes with... And the
goal, the scoring of the run is having
[SPEAKER_00]: these unique experiences that we don't
know exactly what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are laying down new neural
pathways which is the ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when you come down off the
ketamine and you've had some time to rest
[SPEAKER_00]: and you integrate, you're actually
integrating new neural pathways which
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow relieve the depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the way it was explained to
me, and I'm not a neurologist by any
[SPEAKER_01]: means, but what happens is when you get
into a depressive state, you get pathways
[SPEAKER_01]: that get stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't unhook or change to two
other pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just kind of become dominant
pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the ketamine really just unplugs
those pathways and then wires them back to
[SPEAKER_01]: where they should be or into new pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know 100% but that's kind of how
it was explained to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ring around your head is what
controls those depressive thoughts and
[SPEAKER_01]: those anxious thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good to have depressive thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also good to have anxious thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not good to have them 90% of the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's what this does is it
really helps loosen that grip that the
[SPEAKER_01]: depression gets on the neurological grip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just takes hold of your brain and
doesn't want to let go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this ketamine really loosens that grip
so you can still feel sad when sad things
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you don't want to be walking
around life and somebody tells you,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, your father just passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had a great relationship with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, yep, there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be able to grieve and have
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have the full range of
emotions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't want to be constantly like
every day or just stuck in the valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think the ketamine really helped
me in a way kind of loosen up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a slow loosen up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're anxious, you're tense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're depressed, you don't want
to be around anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ketamine kind of just took the
tension away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took away the consistent thought of
wanting to kill myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: For three or four months, all I could
think about was, how am I going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the way in which I'm going to do
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't want to suffer for a long
time while trying to kill myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want it to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to deal with it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it just kind of removed that
overwhelming focus I had on how am I going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it shifted more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now I got my ship back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get out of being homeless?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get out of moving on from here
and just going?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was overwhelming, but it was
worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like going on an adventure in a
safari, and you get stuck in the jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you didn't plan on it, but you got
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you have an awesome story to tell
people for the rest of your life that I
[SPEAKER_01]: did some amazing things in the jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate plants I've never seen before,
drank off of leaves, and slept under trees
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a rebirth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it changed my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changed me for the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me a stronger person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that you did three of the
intramuscular shots in the clinic first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's called a tranche?
[SPEAKER_00]: A troche.
[SPEAKER_00]: A troche.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you describe it, it sounds like doing
liquid acid on a sugar cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially it is like a sugar cube
with a little bit of oral ketamine in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had about 100 milligrams of
ketamine per dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was told to take 100 milligrams per
session at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found that 200 milligrams was a
little bit better setting for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically at that time period,
I was living in my car, sleeping in my
[SPEAKER_01]: car.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd set up the car in a way that I had
an air mattress that had an SUV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put the back seats down, put the air
mattress in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a couple heavy blankets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had the eye mask as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dr. Agarwal had mentioned you really
should play some music along with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that has a calm relaxation to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes you hear that meditative music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get it like a yoga studio or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something you vibe with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I chose The Grateful Dead for my first
session, Dick's Picks volume number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seemed to be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Troach sessions are much softer than
the intramuscular sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go off into kind of a slight
another dimension.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was listening to the Dick's Picks
Grateful Dead session, it felt like I was
[SPEAKER_01]: on stage at the show that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry was off to the right playing his
guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob was standing next to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear the boys banging on the drums
in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got that mask on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your car, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So your brain is creating the experience
of seeing the band to go with the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really kind of like a happy
experience for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never seen The Grateful Dead before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, guys, Jerry Garcia is playing
guitar right next to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it came out of that one with a very
happy attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other two sessions that I did in my
car, I actually downloaded music that was
[SPEAKER_01]: like to a certain hertz, 432 hertz.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is supposed to be like a tone in
which is a healing tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that really helped kind of like
create like a ohm state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of mental cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I think that music is because
that was similar to the music that Sunil
[SPEAKER_01]: had played in the doctor's office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to jump back to that temporarily
really quickly, one of the experiences I
[SPEAKER_01]: had in there with him was I was on the
floor and coming out of the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was maybe the last 30 minutes of the
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had the mask off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my eyes were open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very mildly hallucinating, but in a
tranquil state kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunil had asked if he could meditate above
my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was on the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sat back here in Lotus and was
meditating over me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, he would ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Singing bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Singing bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time he rang the singing bowl,
I would howl uncontrollably to the pitch
[SPEAKER_01]: that the bowl was making.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know, and like,
and he was like, OK, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was singing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got to the point where it got so
much energy moving through my body that my
[SPEAKER_01]: arm like unwillingly went and just grabbed
Sunil's head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like just I held onto his head and I
could feel like an energy beam coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: of his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I could feel his like human energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told him, I was like, I feel all
your power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he didn't budge.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just kept it was awesome because he
just kept, you know, meditating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was totally with the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, what are you doing grabbing
me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, this is unprofessional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he he went with it, rode with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was an amazing feeling for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really kind of like boosted my energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I was sucking energy out
of his head or if it was just the the him
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing me to do that, like that personal
contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like made my energy like enhanced
or something of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a very interesting experience
to me that made me feel really good after
[SPEAKER_01]: the after the come down of the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back to the troches, the experience
with the the instrumental music at the
[SPEAKER_01]: four hundred thirty two hertz was
extremely beneficial after the second and
[SPEAKER_01]: third Troach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I did a total of four of them
after the second third Troach session.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was almost completely like healed and I
felt like a completely different person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in the sense that like I'm not Tyler
Markward anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Bob Johnson or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more that like I had a clarity in
my head and zero focus towards depression,
[SPEAKER_01]: zero focus on anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is for me being thirty eight
years of eating and forcing myself to eat
[SPEAKER_01]: or since being thirteen years old,
smoking weed before every single meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's the only way I can get
through eating a meal is is getting high
[SPEAKER_01]: and forcing myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, certainly over the last year,
you know, you doing these seven and then
[SPEAKER_00]: and then integrating them, you know,
you're clearly a less miserable friend.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before before you got turned on to the
ketamine, you know, you were a good friend
[SPEAKER_00]: and you were frickin miserable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an angry person.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people had told me that and I
recognize that myself that I was not
[SPEAKER_01]: happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ruins personal relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ruined business relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ruined dating relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was a major problem in my life
and I had to change something about it
[SPEAKER_01]: either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to take care of myself or I'm going
to off myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so let's let's move to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so this is a pretty specific video,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be talking about ketamine at
this level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so probably the only people who are
still with us are people who are either
[SPEAKER_00]: depressed and looking for solutions or
people who are looking at ketamine for
[SPEAKER_00]: other reasons that they're looking for
relief from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and maybe they're using this video as
part of their decision making process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you what would you say or what
are you going to say to anybody who is
[SPEAKER_00]: watching who may be considering ketamine
therapy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, you know, if they were somebody
that you were chatting with and and they
[SPEAKER_00]: brought it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you have to say to them
directly to, I don't know, help them
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out whether or not ketamine is
going to be for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's one of those situations
where it's individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be different for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people may have a quick reaction to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people may not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth trying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth changing your life for the
better because you can get that
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity out there is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nice part is, is some insurance
companies do cover it like I had
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately paid out of pocket because I
didn't have any health insurance at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was also very affordable for the
sense of what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to comment on what the
pricing is because I think the pricing
[SPEAKER_01]: changed so I wouldn't be on point as far
as that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less than rent for a month for most
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that I think is there is a solution
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of our biggest problems is
is we have this Controlled Substance Act,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is limiting our ability to access
drugs that can really help people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ketamine is on that list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think really getting that stuff
changed on the government level will make
[SPEAKER_01]: a major impact in all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Society's life because people will have
access towards medication that can really
[SPEAKER_01]: change their lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worked for a multitude of other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's starting to become more
accepted like just like psilocybin is for
[SPEAKER_01]: microdosing and LSD is for microdosing
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people if you just have the
opportunity to look into it a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more and face that fear of overwhelming
psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get to a totally different place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can change who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you're the best representation of
this because you and I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction together on a daily or weekly
basis where we talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really did see that I was an angry
asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have seen me change to somebody
who is less angry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have that mentality anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm extremely grateful for Sunil.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Allison and for all the other people
at the clinic who helped me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody at the clinic couldn't be a
better person for that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mild temperament.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just welcoming arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean Sunil would give me a hug every
time I came to the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most doctors don't even come near you or
like shake your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this doctor has given me a hug and
welcoming to the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's when the individual is
ready to make the change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's also like the depression has
to get to a point where you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledge that you need to make a
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's the hardest thing
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the opportunity is out there for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now you have to take advantage of the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the only way you're going to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody can force you to be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody can force you to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make that decision yourself
and say I want to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make this change.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are tools out there for me to access
that in a legal manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ames Institute is not the only
institute in the United States who's doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the therapy is in Chicago and
New York as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not 100% sure where they're located.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know there are other offices that
are located.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of mine's father did the therapy
in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did it under DRIP IV as opposed to
intermuscular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did not have as much of a response
to it as I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also older too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if that experience had any
tie in with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, it's different for every
individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think really looking into it and
reading those ketamine papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The book is actually called Ketamine
Papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going onto PubMed.gov and doing other
research about ketamine and seeing what's
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're the only one who's in
control of your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have the ability to make the
changes if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be really hard and challenging and
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you're in that state,
any action can be a depressive action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether your shoelaces are untied,
you trip and fall, you drop a glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can just spiral into almost like a
suicide thought process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because your world is crumbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a light at the end of the
tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That light is provided by ketamine and
other substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people need to get that
negative mantra of drugs are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is bad in excess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people react to things differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can eat cheeseburgers all day and
not gain any weight because I have IBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheeseburgers aren't bad for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of America is not doing too good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an individual thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I think the opportunities are
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And opportunity is the biggest and best
word that we can have in our culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what leads to growth and
leads to betterment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that opportunity can only be taken
when you want it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to change, then you can make
it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just know that the tools are out there
to help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, even when you're consuming the
tools and after you've consumed the tools,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still an active process of wanting to
be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just need to change your whole
mentality to bettering yourself,
[SPEAKER_01]: bettering the environment around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not particularly like, you know,
doing K&F or like soil regeneration,
[SPEAKER_01]: but more like keeping yourself clean,
like showering and like eating healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Self-care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, self-care and self-love and that
kind of stuff, which is I think very
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult for a lot of people,
especially men in America, where I think
[SPEAKER_01]: we're in a state where the patriarch is a
big problem, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like people are struggling with
male-dominated industries and
[SPEAKER_01]: male-dominated things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that comes down to,
I think we could have a major shift in
[SPEAKER_01]: society if that male-dominance thought
process was rewired to a thought process
[SPEAKER_01]: of non-dominance, but association and
cooperation and moving forward in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that everybody can have opportunity and
access to opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's really where it comes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think opportunity is the big key here,
is there is opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people can take advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think America struggles right now
with wanting to get out of that classic
[SPEAKER_01]: materialistic mindset, which has
overwhelmed us for the last 50 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be any surprise that somebody
with as bombastic of a personality as you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would take like a serious hallucinogen
for you to find the relief you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for going to all that effort
to find a solution so that we could keep
[SPEAKER_00]: you around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to Allison and Dr. Sunil for
helping you get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, thank you for sitting
down this Sunday morning and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing some of your story because you're
on the front edge of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a lot of people who have
done ketamine under doctor's care at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point and significantly less who are
willing to share their story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about depression and anxiety is
really difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So find one person that you trust to talk
to about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it will definitely change your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for sharing this time with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for watching Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Tyler Marquardt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thank you.
