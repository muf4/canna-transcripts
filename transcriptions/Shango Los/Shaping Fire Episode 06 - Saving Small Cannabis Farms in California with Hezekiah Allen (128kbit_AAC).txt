[SPEAKER_01]: I remember back when I was younger,
we would get high and lay on the grass and
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about how cool it would be to move to
California and grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: California was the promised land of
getting high on beaches drenched in
[SPEAKER_01]: sunshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had no idea how to make that reality
happen, but we all knew that being a
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana farmer in Humboldt County was
pretty much the gold standard of life
[SPEAKER_01]: goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the cannabis in the Midwest was
all moldy brick wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every now and then, someone would come
back from a trip to California and we
[SPEAKER_01]: would all gather around to see the big,
dense, and fragrant flowers that were
[SPEAKER_01]: called kind bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting California flower next to Mexican
brickweed, you'd not even know they were
[SPEAKER_01]: the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like that, the kind bud was
smoked, and it was gone, and after a while
[SPEAKER_01]: it seemed like myth again that flowers
like that even existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we knew they existed because we saw
them in High Times Magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: These ornate, colorful, and perfect
flowers were pretty much unattainable to
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We considered flowers from California with
reverence.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of California was more than just
the gorgeous bud itself, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the small, clandestine farmers in
love with the land and making it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was these back-to-the-land folks giving
up the city and growing their own food and
[SPEAKER_01]: subsisting on income from weed crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have been modest-income small
farmers, but they were happy, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were high, and they had community.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about that fantasy of California
we held in our imagination was that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually pretty true.
[SPEAKER_01]: While the DEA certainly played a role and
there was a general fear of outsiders,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I have talked to old-timers in
Garberville or Mendocino or wherever,
[SPEAKER_01]: they describe a world quite like the one
we always imagined it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, though, those farmers are being
threatened by the potential consolidation
[SPEAKER_01]: of production into huge farms,
leading to the end of the small family
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is in no way a done deal,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small farmers in California can stand up
and demand that their voice be heard and
[SPEAKER_01]: influence the implementation of
Proposition 64 so their culture can be
[SPEAKER_01]: preserved instead of obliterated by
corporatism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it isn't only just on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us, as cannabis enthusiasts,
can speak up that we don't want only
[SPEAKER_01]: mass-produced flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want artisan flour, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to preserve California's
cannabis heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's episode is part two of two in our
series on the impacts and opportunities of
[SPEAKER_01]: Proposition 64 in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you missed last week's episode with
Amanda Ryman of the Drug Policy Alliance,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go back and hear our discussion
about new business opportunities now that
[SPEAKER_01]: Proposition 64 has passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's show is about what comes next for
small farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to talk about the impact
of Proposition 64 on small cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers and the actions necessary to
preserve artisan cannabis agriculture in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Hezekiah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for making the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, going into the election,
there was a great deal of fear by a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: folks about the outcome of Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some folks, especially people who
think business-wise, simply not knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: how the election was going to turn out
made business decisions really difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we're on the far side of the
election and we know that Proposition 64
[SPEAKER_01]: has passed, what are you hearing from
farmers and families in the Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle region of Northern California
about how they feel now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in a single word, I think
uncertainty is the overarching theme here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly going into the election,
there was a lot of uncertainty about how
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal adult use regulated market would
play out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think coming out of the election,
you know, and this is a bit of a curveball
[SPEAKER_00]: for everyone, coming out of the election,
there's also significantly increased
[SPEAKER_00]: uncertainty at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, exactly how this is
going to play out and what implementation
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to look like was riddled with
uncertainty to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that conversation is even a bit
more uncertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks aren't quite sure what to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, of course, my job and the reason
I moved down here to Sacramento to work on
[SPEAKER_00]: this issue is to try to stay really at the
cutting edge of that conversation to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to cut through some of that uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, I don't have a huge amount
of solid feedback to give to members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all sort of looking at what
passed, looking at current law and
[SPEAKER_00]: speculating as to what may happen at the
federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, you know, it's anything but
celebratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: For folks who have criminal convictions or
who are facing charges or are in jail,
[SPEAKER_00]: those folks are stoked and everybody is
100% in alignment that they should be out
[SPEAKER_00]: of jail and those charges should be
dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the business side, a really,
really tremendous amount of uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that must be really frustrating
for you as somebody who grew up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Triangle area and as their
representative down in Sacramento,
[SPEAKER_01]: for them to turn to you for sage advice
and insight, but for you to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not really know anything more than
we knew before the election, since the
[SPEAKER_01]: rulemaking hasn't really started yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: As somebody who, you know, represents
people who are not only your constituents,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like these are, this is your family
and people you grew up and your loved
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There must be a certain amount of
frustration kind of packed into that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, and this is certainly the
frustration that we felt ahead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: election.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the association, largest
association of cannabis businesses in
[SPEAKER_00]: California with probably close to about
900 members at the time of this recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we felt that frustration ahead
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of policy in Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of statute that was passed
last year by the legislature and part of
[SPEAKER_00]: our concern and part of why we were never,
never able to get to a support position on
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop 64 is because of the immensity of it
and because of how many aspects of it are
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit unclear and the disparities or
disagreements with current law and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out which provisions will be
preeminent and which ones will actually
[SPEAKER_00]: govern the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it is a bit frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess the saving grace and,
you know, a bit of irony in describing it
[SPEAKER_00]: as a silver lining, but the silver lining
is there's still plenty of things growers
[SPEAKER_00]: can be working on from water permits to
labor law to tax law.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's plenty of things that
folks who are currently operating in the
[SPEAKER_00]: underground or gray medical market,
there's plenty of things they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not a shortage of compliance
tasks for the growers to be doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is certainly frustrating to have,
frankly, more answers than we did the day
[SPEAKER_00]: before, excuse me, more questions than we
did the day before the answer,
[SPEAKER_00]: before the election.
[SPEAKER_00]: Answers are hard to come by and questions
are plentiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you're probably trying to hand
out more patience than anything to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it surprised a lot of
folks that the voting returns from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle counties actually came back in
favor of the proposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, even though I read over the weekend
that Mendocino County very literally
[SPEAKER_01]: passed it by one vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it surprise you that the counties
ended up voting in favor of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, you know, I think, I think at this
point in 2016, it was pretty much a
[SPEAKER_00]: foreground conclusion from our perspective
that it would pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a lot of people that took a yes on
adult use, no on Prop 64 position.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I would estimate and some of
our initial post, post election surveys
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate that, you know, public support
was probably closer to 65 or 70 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that we saw numbers in the
mid fifties throughout the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: it reflects the fact that there there was
a significant yes on adult use voting
[SPEAKER_00]: block, no on 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were pretty, pretty confident that
it was going to be successful this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of all of the numbers indicated such
and there was no good reason to believe
[SPEAKER_00]: they weren't going to pull a majority in
most counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The map looks a lot like we expected it
to, frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's that schism that there
was before the election.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yes on adult use, no on 64 folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was hard because people who are
family and friends and have done business
[SPEAKER_01]: together and medical providers,
you know, there was this subtle cut in
[SPEAKER_01]: between the community and the closer it
got to the election and more of it got
[SPEAKER_01]: turned up and up and up on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was pretty rough there right at
the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that probably everybody is
just happy to have the damn election over
[SPEAKER_01]: so we can deal with the reality of it
instead of everybody trying to convince
[SPEAKER_01]: each other and hate on each other about
whichever side they were on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I certainly think that's an accurate
observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think one thing that was
particularly acute for our community and
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the cannabis culture in California
is one of sort of escaping from the
[SPEAKER_00]: system, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents went back to the land to get
away from all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our culture is very much an
outsider's culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of our members, this was the
first election cycle that they've gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through and actually had a real tangible
emotional stake in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, for me and for folks who
work in politics, election fever is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty well known thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you get, you get really,
really worked up and intense and
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate in the weeks leading up to the
election.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you wake up the next day and you
sort of see how long the hangover lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for a lot of people experiencing
that phenomenon for the first time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it got particularly nasty, you know,
boycotts of businesses that were voting no
[SPEAKER_00]: and just, just, you know, frankly,
a lot more divisive than it needed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the beautiful thing is now
that that cycle has concluded,
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers know about cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they understand, okay, so that was
harvest and now we're tilling the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: starting over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to be able to have gone through the
cycle, made it through the fever,
[SPEAKER_00]: and frankly, to have emerged more unified
and stronger than we went into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is a pretty significant
accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would definitely agree with you
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's, it's too bad that it
happened right there during harvest time
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must have been really distracting from
everybody trying to, trying to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I actually think we saw a
bit of relief there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right around the third week of October
when the rains hit, we saw a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: social media, at least from my
perspective, cool off and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone had more pressing concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vote by mail ballots had already been
mailed and, you know, it was, it was back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the farm, which is where most growers
want to be spending their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually worked out pretty well with
the weather and the conditions and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: gave us a bit of relief right in the lead
up, the immediate lead up to the election
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, before we go to commercial,
I want to ask you one cultural question
[SPEAKER_01]: about harvest over there in the Humboldt
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I heard once that there are so
many growers in the area that the
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses that sell high price tag things
like cars and stuff, they actually
[SPEAKER_01]: advertise harvest sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like you've made your harvest and
then you've sold it down the line and now
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got your big yearly income.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see that happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do businesses really target market
harvesters because there's so many growers
[SPEAKER_01]: in the region?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the only thing that I'll
correct in that sort of understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: the situation is this is not a phenomenon
that's limited to the Triangle Tri-County
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is something we see statewide
from Calaveras to all of Calumny out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the foothills, Nevada County, Sierra
County, Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the one of one of the things from
an academic perspective that I'm most
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about as this marketplace emerges
into regulation is wrapping our minds and
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginations around the scope and the
scale of our outdoor harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is truly an epic agricultural feat that
we managed to get all of this labor
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive, high value, delicate by some
standards perishable product out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, onto the wires and into the turkey
bags in such a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am thoroughly excited about having
better understanding of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, we definitely see that
in many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of rural California is operating on a
harvest cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, a lot of other
agriculture has that same cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not completely unheard of,
but it's really undeniable that that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis harvest is a major driving force
in regional economies up and down the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that little bit of culture
injection there, Hezekiah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take our first short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using pesticides when growing cannabis has
been common for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, though, we know better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that most pesticides formulated
for food crops have never been tested for
[SPEAKER_01]: use with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been tested to be eaten in tiny
doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have not been tested to be inhaled
and especially not concentrated into a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chemical residues from pesticides are not
healthy for anyone, but they are
[SPEAKER_01]: especially dangerous for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: For commercial cannabis growers,
this has become very impactful Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: enthusiasts and patients have gotten
educated enough that they avoid growers
[SPEAKER_01]: who used pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but states across the
country have begun making pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: testing mandatory on all licensed cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The time has come to find a better way to
fight garden pests than covering your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a better way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let some good bugs fight your bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insects and predatory mites
have come a long way since we were born.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural Enemies Biocontrol can help you
solve pest issues without using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural Enemies founder Shane Young
learned best practices from working in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plant industry and has
fine-tuned those strategies specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: for large cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shane works with commercial cannabis
clients across the country to ensure that
[SPEAKER_01]: they keep their crops safe and pest-free
without the use of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural Enemies has proven solutions for
spider mites, aphids, thrips, russet
[SPEAKER_01]: mites, broad mites, shoreflies,
whitefly and others too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can rely on Natural Enemies for
expertise and excellent service.

week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Hezekiah Allen, executive
[SPEAKER_01]: director of the California Growers
Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hezekiah, before the break,
we were talking about the lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: certainty on growers' parts about what's
going to happen next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there are a lot of lobbyist
groups who will be trying to influence
[SPEAKER_01]: policymaking in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the artisan farmers
throughout California, the smaller folks,
[SPEAKER_01]: will have a voice in the rulemaking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, if I have anything to do about
it, they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very much the purpose for which
the California Growers Association was
[SPEAKER_00]: organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our general highest level metric of
success will be how many independent grows
[SPEAKER_00]: are successful in the regulated
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, economists will boil things
down to how big is a market, what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: gross productivity of this marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from our perspective, we want to go a
layer deeper and we care greatly about
[SPEAKER_00]: what that ownership pattern looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so transitioning, not just from what
is the gross value, gross productivity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the market, but how many people,
how many businesses are enjoying the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of that productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's a, I think,
a very relevant and salient message in
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of the greater political,
be it national or global, as we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at this economic reality that,
you know, there's more wealth in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: today than there ever has been in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, absolute and relative poverty are
off the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are we offering this new and
amazing alternative medicine, we're also
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing this very different culture that
incubated outside of that economic
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the postwar years, 1950 was not
that long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a very different wealth
distribution, both nationally and globally
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our industry grew up outside of the
consolidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be able to bring that back in such
a culturally stimulating, exciting,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a product that people care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the headlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to bring that to the
conversation in, you know, early on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 21st century, I think has implications,
not just for our marketplace, but for the
[SPEAKER_00]: broader academic study of economics in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, certainly at this point,
we're pushing a thousand members.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to double that again this
calendar year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we look around the state,
we're estimating about 50,000 growers
[SPEAKER_00]: total, probably about 30,000 of them would
eventually seek a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd love to see five or 10,000 of
them licensed in year one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we certainly, I think it's fair to
say that the existing growers in the state
[SPEAKER_00]: not only have a voice, but are one of the
preeminent voices in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to continue growing our
membership and growing our influence
[SPEAKER_00]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is such both an honorable and a
really difficult fight because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, capitalism just generally moves
towards consolidation so that economies of
[SPEAKER_01]: scale can be taken advantage of and prices
generally come down and profits are made.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, what you're suggesting is
that, you know, it's better to have more
[SPEAKER_01]: small businesses than fewer gargantuan
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's where a lot of
people's heart is, but pushing back on
[SPEAKER_01]: those economic forces is a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, where I grew up,
very few things were easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, every harvest came in spite of
at the time of paramilitary war on drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Bush senior sent the National
Guard out a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, you know, we grew up on the front
lines of this thing and our culture was
[SPEAKER_00]: really tempered by that most extreme
manifestation of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this is the place that our
culture is coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's certainly present in
other states, Washington, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaska, Oregon, you know, you had these
experiences, but the center of gravity and
[SPEAKER_00]: there are so many people and businesses
and farms coming from that place here
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, frankly, it's about time
that we start questioning some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: basic tenets of economics and what better
community of businesses to do it than
[SPEAKER_00]: ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, change has to be financed.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, you know,
there's no way that we can win a
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution of economics, of
sustainability, of labor, of any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things that our culture is marked by.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way we can win that fight
without a financial commercial base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in a very unique position of
having that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's so important to permit
and license those businesses so that this
[SPEAKER_00]: message that we carry continues to have
voice and continues to have momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think at the end of the day,
if we stop and take the time to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves, is this economic system working
for us as people, as families,
[SPEAKER_00]: as neighborhoods?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer, frankly, is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do need to start doing some things
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look to a handful of states in the
farm belt just to add a quick aside to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 11 states in the nation that
currently restrict the corporate ownership
[SPEAKER_00]: of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those 11 states from a human
development index standard, they have some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the longest lifespans, lowest infant
mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is so much better than the
states around them that have allowed for
[SPEAKER_00]: the financial sector to gut agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something really, really special,
a special kind of value that small farms
[SPEAKER_00]: bring to our communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And building on that value, not just from
a cultural perspective, but also from a
[SPEAKER_00]: economic perspective, it really needs to
be the foundation of our 21st century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last point I'll make on this
subject, it's very uncommon for me to cite
[SPEAKER_00]: a World Trade Organization paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2013, the World Trade Organization
teamed up with the United Nations
[SPEAKER_00]: Commission on Trade and Development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they released a report called Wake Up
Before It's Too Late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small farms are the only way to feed the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really called into question the
entire driving thesis behind the
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial agricultural revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at this point, there really is a
global movement picking up steam to put
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural productivity back in the
hands of family farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest challenges,
of course, to that, and one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: the Obama administration didn't take this
one on, is because of the entrenched
[SPEAKER_00]: interests of agribusiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are giants of global commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't exist in our marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have this very unique
opportunity to move quickly with a
[SPEAKER_00]: different type of regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's precisely what we've been doing
and what we intend to continue doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As executive director of the California
Growers Association, you have got,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, at least two really nice
advantages as far as getting your base
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, like you said, it's an
industry that grew up outside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: consolidation world and in the gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you've been to war together
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've had the war on drugs come to your
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it bonded people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really let people get to know each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're not a hodgepodge of folks
that are put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're already a prepared, communicative
folks who have each other's phone numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: and email addresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, as far as income distribution,
which is what you've been talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: having the big conversation and message of
Bernie Sanders in the election got people
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about whether or not
consolidation and big business helped them
[SPEAKER_01]: as individual people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that having both your people
already know each other and the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: that message was pushed so heavily during
this particular election can only help the
[SPEAKER_01]: California Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, we saw it from, I think,
the Trump campaign as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: While a lot of folks on the coast,
particularly our beautiful Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest out here, I think we were
triggered by some of the more racist,
[SPEAKER_00]: misogynist, xenophobic things that the
incoming president said.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for academics who have now had the
opportunity to take the time to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: speeches and to do quantitative analyses,
whether or not it's lip service,
[SPEAKER_00]: the incoming president spent a lot of time
talking about the damage that free trade
[SPEAKER_00]: agreements, the damage that this
particular neoliberal breed of economic
[SPEAKER_00]: development has done to the heartland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while it's easier to find the
affinity with the with the Senator Sanders
[SPEAKER_00]: campaign, I think that there's also a
commonality in in folks who voted for the
[SPEAKER_00]: incoming administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while, of course, we talked about the
uncertainty at the beginning, we have no
[SPEAKER_00]: idea how this administration, particularly
the incoming attorney general,
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to respond and react to cannabis
laws throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an underlying majority and I
think a growing majority that big is not
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the fundamental question that
we need to ask ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we went through it in 2006,
seven, eight with the too big to fail era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way to not end up in that
situation, again, is to prevent that level
[SPEAKER_00]: of consolidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually think that it's a it's a
populist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a resurgent populist message that is
bridging partisan divides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unifying campaigns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, I think that the Clinton
campaign was unsuccessful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Successful because they didn't have a
meaningful answer to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that over the next 10
to 20 years, this will be the defining
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this policy going to impact the
middle class?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to create more small
business owners?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we need to get into some of
those definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a small business?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grossing two point five million is not
small from my perspective, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is one of those important areas
where current state law for the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: regs defines small business very
differently than Prop 64 does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop 64 defines a micro business as being
four times larger than what current law
[SPEAKER_00]: defines the micro business as.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a real slant and bias toward
larger businesses in Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ultimately was why we weren't
able to support it is because it preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer, bigger businesses over more smaller
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for that, Hezekiah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take another short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Businesses everywhere are constantly
striving to reach out to people through
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know, though, that trying to reach
a cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_01]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will explain your service or product
and what sets it apart as desirable and
[SPEAKER_01]: help our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising does not have to be all
whiz-bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_01]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the podcast is young but growing
at an exceptionally fast rate,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, you are going to pay a
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction of the cost we'll be asking for
in just a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet everyone listening both now and to
the back catalog of interviews later will
[SPEAKER_01]: hear about your company again and again
for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_01]: listening audience we will have forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Hezekiah Allen, executive
[SPEAKER_01]: director of the California Growers
Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hezekiah, on the last episode of
Shaping Fire, Amanda Ryman of the Drug
[SPEAKER_01]: Policy Alliance was on the show,
and she said that the new law very much
[SPEAKER_01]: protects medical in California,
but she also said that the bigger medical
[SPEAKER_01]: players who can afford the costs of
compliance in adult use with the new law
[SPEAKER_01]: will very likely migrate to the commercial
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, I've been a business
strategist my whole life, and to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: that suggests to me a future where the
medical market slowly gets drained of its
[SPEAKER_01]: major players and therefore major funding,
and it gets smaller and weaker until the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial lobbyists who you know are
dying to inhale that medical market find a
[SPEAKER_01]: way to say, oh, the medical market is
irrelevant, and they try to shut them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see it playing out at this
point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I think that this idea
that Prop 64 protects the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace is a bit more of campaign
rhetoric than actual policy work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so California was obviously the first
to pass a medical law back in 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a two decade long tradition of
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is compassionate use and compassionate
commerce are very much the foundation of
[SPEAKER_00]: our cannabis industry and marketplace,
be it regulated medical, unregulated adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use or out of state sales, which of
course, you know, California is a large
[SPEAKER_00]: exporter of cannabis as well, but that
culture really threads the needle between
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those marketplaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the initiative would not have been
politically viable if it was perceived to
[SPEAKER_00]: undermine that marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the campaign ran very, very heavily on
this point that you know, medical is
[SPEAKER_00]: protected, this is separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true, just to put it simply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything around town in Sacramento here
in the legislature, the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies, everyone's pulling their hair
out trying to figure out how we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to fold these marketplaces together,
what rules and regs apply to both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that before we knew the outcome of
the presidential election, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty firm consensus that California
would emerge with a single regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think everyone is sort of on alert
that the federal government may decide to
[SPEAKER_00]: impose a distinction on the states,
something to the effect of we'll respect
[SPEAKER_00]: states medical programs, but we won't
respect states adult use programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that uncertainty has certainly
clouded the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth of the matter is at the end
of the day, at least up until the consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: purchases the cannabis, there is likely to
be one unified supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: A grower is not going to be a medical
grower or an adult use grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're simply going to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticide regulations are not going to
differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not safe for a patient,
it's not safe for an adult consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those types of things are going to be
unified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was always the intent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one of those places where
policy and politics don't always match.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a necessary political goal to
insulate and to carve out medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: but from an implementation, bureaucratic,
who's going to give you a license?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be the same office.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not going to be two offices and
two bureaus and two directors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's important to distinguish
how politics and policy differ in this
[SPEAKER_00]: regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple more questions about
economies of scale here and how you see it
[SPEAKER_01]: playing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the economies of scale will continue to
favor the large commercial growers as they
[SPEAKER_01]: start to create more profits because they
can essentially buy things like supplies
[SPEAKER_01]: and labor in bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think that the Emerald Triangle
Appalachian region that will eventually be
[SPEAKER_01]: created will be enough to support the
higher prices that artisan farmers were
[SPEAKER_01]: will likely have to charge since they're
smaller and can't take advantage of buying
[SPEAKER_01]: things in such mega bulk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so this goes back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That initial question is bigger,
actually better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's been a lot of work done
on the high cost of low prices and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding that those economies of
scale are not actually reduced costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just externalize more of their costs
and society ends up bearing those costs,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it, you know, for traditional
agriculture, that comes in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: farm subsidies or for the oil industry,
it comes in the form of unmitigated or
[SPEAKER_00]: unrestored environmental damages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those costs still exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you want to get really
technical about it, products grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture in particular, large scale
grows are probably more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer is seeing a reduced cost,
but the overall social cost is not
reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to do a better job of doing
true cost accounting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that's all well and good
academic conceptual feel good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about nuts and bolts on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the biggest distinctions
between Prop 64 and the medical regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical regs limit any single license
holder to one acre per lot and four acres
[SPEAKER_00]: cumulative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop 64 blows it wide open and allows a
licensee to grow as much as they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, we don't think anyone needs to
grow more than an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very much our intent this year in
2017 to ask everyone in the state who
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to grow more than an acre,
raise your hand, come to the legislature
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell us why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us what the public benefit of you
doing that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to ask the state for some
level of limited liability through a
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate charter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a free pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corporate charters shouldn't be handed out
so easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Demonstrate how you will promote good
jobs, not minimum wage jobs, good jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Demonstrate how you will protect
California's scarce water and why going
[SPEAKER_00]: big is going to allow you to improve those
metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, the truth is
they won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small farms are more resource
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create better jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really is a question of how we
look at efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those cost savings real or are they
just externalized?
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, what are the secondary
benefits and the multiplier effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibiting those large grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just say at the end of at the end
of this conversation, there is a clear
[SPEAKER_00]: consensus that the Lieutenant Governor's
Blue Ribbon Commission report states very
[SPEAKER_00]: succinctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is appropriate and wise for the state
of California to limit the size and power,
[SPEAKER_00]: both economic and political, of any single
entity in the cannabis marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if you had to make that
argument anywhere in the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are the best place to make that
argument where the ideas of of social
[SPEAKER_01]: socially conscious business and,
you know, and triple bottom line profit
[SPEAKER_01]: really, you know, people are interested to
know that, OK, so the company is making
[SPEAKER_01]: money, the shareholders are making money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what impact is it having on the
community?
[SPEAKER_01]: And and let's not forget that that there's
humans in all these companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I think that if you, you know,
if you had to make that argument anywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you're making it in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and strangely, we find ourselves
drawing on some very unexpected bodies of
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: North Dakota, for example, has what I
think is probably the most robust
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions on corporate ownerships of
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's several states through
the farm belt there that right around the
[SPEAKER_00]: turn of the last century when the railroad
barons were disrupted and and that last
[SPEAKER_00]: major wave of antitrust regulations went
into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you see you see some similar
provisions in states that you really
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't expect this from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so they're actually there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some some other states out there
that we're drawing from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I certainly agree that, you know,
if we're going to if California is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to lead like we so oftentimes project that
we do, which quick tangent, I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: convinced that California is exactly the
trendsetter nationally anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but we certainly identify as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're going to lead in terms of
those values, we're going to need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: bold and courageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is a perfect opportunity
to do just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this last question, you know,
I really try to do my best to decrease
[SPEAKER_01]: fear whenever possible, decrease fear and
suffering in people whenever I have the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's a lot of people who
are still afraid of Proposition 64 because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's passed and they don't know what the
rulemaking is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you have already mentioned,
you know, a lot a lot of more weird ass
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients are going to be going into the
sausage before the rulemaking comes out on
[SPEAKER_01]: the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so take a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice would you give fearful artisan
growers who have been doing this for
[SPEAKER_01]: generations who are afraid of what comes
next?
[SPEAKER_01]: What balm can you offer them that might
help them get through just living through
[SPEAKER_01]: the rulemaking process?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we we really focus on basic core
values at cow growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to boil things down to the most
simplest of terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two things that I can offer are
really the outcomes are going to be better
[SPEAKER_00]: if we have a hand in shaping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more organized we are and the more
we work together, the more influence we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm not trying to veil the
fact that this is a bit self-serving in
[SPEAKER_00]: that, of course, I want the organization
to have more members.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason the organization needs more
members is not so that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go on a fancy vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so that we can have more influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we really are focusing our resources,
pooling resources together to ensure the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes are as best as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, courage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can say with certainty is that the
clock is not going to go backwards on this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are moving forward into a regulated
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to have the courage to embrace
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sooner folks get on the train,
the easier it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years from now, it's going to be
really hard to make the transition from
[SPEAKER_00]: unregulated to regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be on have the courage to be on the
first wave, have the courage to jump in
[SPEAKER_00]: and go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know that there are hundreds, if not
thousands of other like minded businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the state that are going
through this together with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, at the end of the day,
we're going to have the courage to work
[SPEAKER_00]: together to put our values first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you mentioned a minute ago,
we value our profitability, but we also
[SPEAKER_00]: value the places we do business and we
value the people we do business with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I all I can say is that if we put our
values first, we work together to advance
[SPEAKER_00]: them with courage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world is going to be a better place
than if we didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I wake up every morning
and I give thanks for the challenge and
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's be intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bring this amazing healing culture
wisdom that is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bring it to the regulated
marketplace and let's heal not just people
[SPEAKER_00]: and patients and consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also heal the economics and the
politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get any easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have the courage to do it and let's
put our values first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a great call to action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has just been a great interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for taking the time to be on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you're probably even more busy
now that Prop 64 has passed than you were
[SPEAKER_01]: before the election.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks so much for taking the time and
being on the show.
