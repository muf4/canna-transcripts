[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there, friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shango from Shaping Fire here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few weeks ago, Segra International did
this webcast on the history and future of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis breeding, and it was just
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that you'd want to check it out,
so I reached out to Segra International.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, hey, can I have copies of the
video for my YouTube channel so that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: share it with my audience directly?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yeah, we'd love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they send me the videos, and today I'm
presenting you part one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part two will be out in a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the official title for the panel is The
Past, the Present, and the Future of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Breeding, and this is part one
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh my gosh, does it have a top-notch
group of participants on the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off is Ryan Lee that you and I
all know as Chimera, the famous cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is Rob Clark, who's essentially
the godfather of cannabis taxonomy and
[SPEAKER_00]: botany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mark Lewis from Napro Research,
whose cultivars keep on picking up awards
[SPEAKER_00]: at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mojave Richmond of BioEconomics
Group, who's new to me, but adds a lot to
[SPEAKER_00]: the panel as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was moderated by Michael
Williamson of Catalyst BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this part one covers cannabis taxonomy,
cannabis breeding lineage, and historical
[SPEAKER_00]: milestones in cannabis breeding,
and then how some of the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: vocabulary evolved, which is particularly
interesting in how we understand these
[SPEAKER_00]: words.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's also some really great photos
from the folks' personal collections that
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So historically cool photos are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an all-around fantastic hour and a
half to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back for a couple days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back in a couple days to see part
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to subscribe to the channel
while you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also jump on over and subscribe to
Segri International, who've got the new
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel, who agreed to share this
video with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn this now over to my good
friend Michael Williamson, who's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: moderate the panel for us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael himself is no slouch when it comes
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a long track record ranging from
founding one of the first licensed
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries in the state of Colorado to
breeding some of the industry's top
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic clients, and also designing some
of the most sophisticated cannabis grower
[SPEAKER_02]: operations in the world with his company,
Catalyst BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Michael, I will turn it over to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for hosting this event for all of
us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the panel today, I'm super excited and
honored to kind of moderate for Ryan Lee,
[SPEAKER_06]: co-founder of Chemovar Health,
Rob Clark, co-owner of BioAgronomic Group,
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark Lewis, president of Napro Research,
and Mojave Richardson, also co-owner and
[SPEAKER_06]: founder of BioAgronomic Group.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to get started, guys, I wanted to kind
of have you guys give a little bit of
[SPEAKER_06]: pedigree information.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the questions that we're
looking to answer here is, when did you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys make your first way into the cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, at what point and why did you
look into breeding after you got into
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll start with you, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it seems like forever ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got into the cannabis industry quite
early.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess kind of when I was a consumer in
high school.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when I got into university,
I had a keen interest in genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was already making seeds and
crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was really kind of a way to
understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it put a practical side to the
theoretical stuff I was learning in
[SPEAKER_04]: university.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it just kind of came naturally
after that, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all about finding new things and
just screening plants and learning about
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Rob?
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I think you're on mute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give Rob just a second there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we've got you now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my first real opportunity was
after going to university in Indiana was
[SPEAKER_01]: to go to the Netherlands and work with
David Watson and do the whole horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: farm experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, our breeding aim there was to
try to develop varieties for medicinal use
[SPEAKER_01]: and went on from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What year was that, Rob?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I moved there in 1987.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, quite a while ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, when I was three.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mark?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm also from, I grew up in Indiana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think some of the fruits of Rob's
labor trickled into our ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really Dr. Dre's chronic album
that sent me into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just happened to be really good at
chemistry and went on to get a chemical
[SPEAKER_05]: engineering degree and a PhD in chemistry,
all just like creating a really great
[SPEAKER_05]: skill set for this industry, especially
when in Indiana you go to 4-H.
[SPEAKER_05]: They teach you that seeds turn into
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first time you buy a sack of
cannabis to have seeds in it, you
[SPEAKER_05]: naturally make the connection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you can create seed,
you can always have cannabis and you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have to depend on the undependable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mojabe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess I was kind of born into a
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was born in Big Sur, California in 1969.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was already a kind of a thriving
cannabis culture there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis was kind of the connection to
the active tissue of our community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of grew up in the cannabis
scene, but it wasn't until 1993 when I
[SPEAKER_03]: moved to the Netherlands that I really
started to get into breeding and trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: develop varieties that kind of represented
the cannabis that I remembered in my youth
[SPEAKER_03]: in California.
Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: For some of people who might not be as
familiar with some of the basics,
[SPEAKER_06]: there seems to be a lot of confusion
around the terms indica and sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Rob, can you kind of highlight some of
that for us here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the words began with the taxonomous
of the classical age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Linnaeus kind of at least popularized the
binomial cannabis sativa, referring really
[SPEAKER_01]: to European hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what was in his purview at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later Lamarck, who had seen
cannabis from India, which he named
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we got the terms to begin
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, they're used completely
differently today.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've become part of branding and
advertising and street understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis plant and the variety they're
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, sativa these days refers to
more narrow leaflet drug varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe their heritage would have been
ultimately from India versus newer
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction, the Afghan varieties and
Pakistani varieties that have come to be
[SPEAKER_01]: called indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, it's a giant taxonomic snarl
and we won't go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to people today, it means a number of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing is the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all gone from using these names,
taxonomic names to representing what the
[SPEAKER_01]: herb does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way popular words come to
be and be understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in my mind not a productive way to
look at things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can talk something being indica
predominant or sativa predominant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that has something to do with its
effect compared to the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, everything's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all in between somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems inadequate terminology,
but that's what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get real run with it for now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it definitely seems like there's a
lot of improvement for retail education
[SPEAKER_06]: and people thinking that they need
something based off of this
[SPEAKER_06]: classification, which as you highlighted
is a lot of polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, another question for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the botanical basics that
everyone should know about in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, everybody should know it's daecious.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that there's male flowers on
one plant and female flowers on another
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, at least under normal conditions,
the conditions, the way it evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monitious plants are very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been used in breeding in fiber
hemp varieties, now used for seed
[SPEAKER_01]: production also.
[SPEAKER_01]: For edible seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants that change sex, when we talk about
that, you can induce this, and we'll talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about it shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, they're daecious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a male and a female to make
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not self-pollinated in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's always that variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw it in there, which will weigh on the
next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an annual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've made it a perennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an annual plant by cloning,
but it's an annual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, it goes through a seed cycle
every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows as an escape in places,
what people call wild plants often.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does very well on the edges of human
habitation, but it doesn't really thrive
[SPEAKER_01]: in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's a basic botany of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other complimentary comments there
from the rest of the panel?
[SPEAKER_06]: Ryan, this one's a little bit more geared
for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: How does cannabis breeding actually work?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you walk us through that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we'll come at it first from the
perspective Rob was talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's always important to look at
what an organism does in the wild,
[SPEAKER_04]: how it really naturally breeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then what we do to it is really a
different thing because there's important
[SPEAKER_04]: consequences to learn about the species
and the type of genetic variation that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to be working with from how
it behaves in the wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: This condition where Rob's talking about
what we have daecious plants, males,
[SPEAKER_04]: separate males and females on different
plants really leads to a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: consequences in the breeding scheme.
[SPEAKER_04]: The main thing is that it makes cannabis
an obligate out-crosser, which means you
[SPEAKER_04]: have to have two different individuals
that come together to breed in the wild
[SPEAKER_04]: for there to be made seed, which will be
the generation for next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, I think it's a good way to think
about it for people to think about it as
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis is more like a human mating
system than it is like a tomato mating
[SPEAKER_04]: system, like a different type of selfing
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I mean by that is the way that we
breed, we're never really shedding genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: variation because males always pass on
genetics to the female egg,
[SPEAKER_04]: father-to-mother kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those traits are then combined in the
offspring.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other organisms, you get this thinning
down of the population that happens as a
[SPEAKER_04]: result of the environment and the traits
in the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: That leads to a narrowing of the genetic
type.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see with human genetic
diversity, we have all these different
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic forms from all over the planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the last 150 or so years, we're now
bringing all these different genetic forms
[SPEAKER_04]: together through mating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is much the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: We end up with a lot of genetic variation
and a lot of different possibilities,
[SPEAKER_04]: but inter-family breeding to make
something uniform becomes quite
[SPEAKER_04]: challenging as a result.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just important to understand that
when we have the males that are producing
[SPEAKER_04]: pollen and it lands on the female plant,
that's really the creation of a seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the plant does from there on and how
we shape it is really a consequence of
[SPEAKER_04]: human selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob talks about this in Cannabis
Evolution, one of his books.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, the plant that we found when human
humanity started interacting with cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: was a small camp following plant,
probably a few feet high, and it made a
[SPEAKER_04]: few small flowers with a little bit of oil
and maybe a little bit of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the changes that we see in modern
cannabis have really been created or
[SPEAKER_04]: reinforced through the eyes of man working
with the genetic possibilities within the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that was a bit of a rambling
explanation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very similar to corn, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: When they first found it as maize,
it didn't produce a whole lot of the
[SPEAKER_05]: kernel, but then after 150 years of
focusing on that kernel, now it produces
[SPEAKER_05]: biomass of corn syrup, the sugar form and
other less-thins that is mind-boggling
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's 30% of the biomass,
which is very similar to cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_05]: the way that humans have stuck their hands
into that machinery somehow just by
[SPEAKER_05]: selective breeding and created a plant
that produces 30% of a medical analyte.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people maybe don't really
understand the wild relative of corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cobs are about the size of your baby
finger or smaller, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a few kernels per cob,
and now we have these massive cobs that
[SPEAKER_04]: produce hundreds or even a thousand
kernels per cob.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a thousand is excessive,
but we have many, many kernels,
[SPEAKER_04]: much bigger cobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really done through rudimentary
breeding, not using science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the indigenous Mexican human
population, they created what we call
[SPEAKER_04]: maize, which is what we call proto-corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a step before that's not quite as big
and indestructible as the corn that we
[SPEAKER_04]: have now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It shows that even with simple breeding
systems, what humans can do just by
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at a plant and saving the seeds
from the plants that are naturally
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding in the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a good way to look at this talk is
to consider what the technologies that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to be using or we have used in
the past and the technologies that we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: be using in the future and how we can use
those to shape and refine cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 30% THCA plant, that was bred by
breeders in their bedrooms or their
[SPEAKER_05]: closets or their backyards, not really
using science.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just using their head state and
pretty much selectively bred other
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids out of the plant's
biosynthetic pathways.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about some of those early
breeders.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, can you highlight what the early
years look like for plant breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The early years were basically people just
crossing land races, which means they
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle-lid and they had seeds because
almost all weed had seeds back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there were seen some shipments that
led to people understanding the meaning of
[SPEAKER_01]: the word as seedless, but weed had seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were curious, as primates that we
are, and we'd stuck them in the ground in
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the early growers or people who
already had gardens, vegetable gardens,
[SPEAKER_01]: places where it was natural for them to
go, stick them in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers as well, but it's really started
as a garden crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It spread from there, but the early days
where you got a bag of Mexican and you
[SPEAKER_01]: grew that the first year and then you got
a bag of Colombian sometime in the interim
[SPEAKER_01]: before the next spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you planted some of those and lo and
behold, that sex thing came in again and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You planted those and you had the first
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next year, somebody got some tie
stick and then you throw that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That became the male because you already
had your stuff you knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next thing you have is half-tie
and a cord or Colombian and a cord or
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexican and that it goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We began with polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went from land races to human curiosity
and basic breeding like we've been talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about takeover.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are really the early days.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened a bit later, and it goes
back to what Mark was just saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: what went on when prohibition suppressed
cannabis so much was that everybody hid
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the internet came along.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the cannabis breeding is one of
the earliest and most poignant examples of
[SPEAKER_01]: crowdsourcing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the other end, not really early
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I jumped, but they're tied together
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The future, we'll see what holds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so far, it's been a fantastic ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mojave, I'm interested in some of the
input you have being pretty much born into
[SPEAKER_06]: a Mecca for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what were some of the early pioneer
breeders working with and how did their
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding objectives also evolve over time?
[SPEAKER_03]: As Rob mentioned, the early breeders,
in my experience, were all growing with
[SPEAKER_03]: land race varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their objective was more to perpetuate
what they had already found.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most of the work was done before
the imported cannabis reached these modern
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: They developed and they crossed,
but most of the work was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of the early import cannabis
was phenomenal and it was already
[SPEAKER_03]: developed and it was more about
acclimating it to the region and growing
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Producing a fresher and more healthier
version of these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something to recognize is
that out of these early land race based
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids, because once it leaves the land,
it's no longer a land race, that there was
[SPEAKER_03]: a little development done and then the
product of that breeding was then passed
[SPEAKER_03]: on to the Netherlands, for instance,
and then they were utilized for stock
[SPEAKER_03]: material to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the bulk of the work was done before
they made it to the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some breeders definitely did a lot of work
and increased the potency and increased
[SPEAKER_03]: the various agronomic traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you think of Afghan one and Hindu
Kush and Durban, these are bag seed that
[SPEAKER_03]: came from imported cannabis and then was
worked on a little bit and then was used
[SPEAKER_03]: to make seeds for decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't a lot of improvement on those
original land race varieties for quite
[SPEAKER_03]: some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are still just a few
generations away from their original
[SPEAKER_03]: source material.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't leave out the importance of the
hunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: The importance of the role of the hunt
played in this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tend to focus as cannabis consumers or
even breeders on the wins, but there was
[SPEAKER_04]: thousands of people trying to grow weed
from the seeds that were in their stash
[SPEAKER_04]: like Rob was saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of that were failures.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of plants, especially that
come out of these land race populations
[SPEAKER_04]: that really aren't very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We call them dogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just plants that are way,
way subpar.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to grow through a lot of those
terrible plants to really find the ones
[SPEAKER_04]: that are exceeding for drug content.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Mark said, we were using our brains a
little bit like a GC and selecting for the
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds of the plants that had the
highest THC content.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really based on how it made us
feel, this idea of a bioassay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The experience that we get from consuming
the plant really dictates our choices in
[SPEAKER_04]: selecting the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, how it smells and tastes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot talk about how important bag
seed was and has been since day one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like the treasure trove.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we used to find seeds, it was like
finding that toy at the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_05]: cracker jack box.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, awesome, we get to grow one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, just to think that the difference
between bag seed from a clone versus bag
[SPEAKER_03]: seed from a pound of weed that was
homogenized from a big batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the cannabis grown in the US was
from seed and when it would be
[SPEAKER_03]: distributed, every single flower was
different from the next.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't just dip into the bag and
pull out seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to go and sort through all the
different flowers and then make your
[SPEAKER_03]: selection, which was really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: As time went on into the late 80s,
I started to notice that there was
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely more consistency among the
batches.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the beginning, sometimes it was a
dog's breakfast of different phenotypes
[SPEAKER_03]: all sold as one variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a blessing growing up in Indiana
was that IU University had one of the two
[SPEAKER_05]: DEA permits.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Rob can speak to this,
but David Watson had sent over,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was 157 seed accessions for
them to grow out at the greenhouse there
[SPEAKER_05]: and do chemotaxonomic analysis on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, college kids growing weed,
those clones and seeds got out and Indiana
[SPEAKER_05]: just happened to be one of these little
tiny epicenters that had kind bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very serendipitous.
[SPEAKER_06]: On that note too, speaking of the 80s and
90s, Mojave, how did the isolated and
[SPEAKER_06]: clandestine nature of modern cannabis
breeders both hinder and help the
[SPEAKER_06]: development of modern cultivars?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for one, what you started to see is
the impact of law enforcement on cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: in the late 70s into the 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: That became the biggest selective pressure
for breeders was developing varieties that
[SPEAKER_03]: could evade law enforcement, whether it
was a lower stature plant grown outdoors
[SPEAKER_03]: that could be hid under canopy,
other plants, or just harvested early
[SPEAKER_03]: enough that law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Camp California of either marijuana
eradication program, they had a timing
[SPEAKER_03]: when they would release the hounds,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all based off of late flowering,
narrow leaf, semi-equatorial varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we started introducing Afghani and
making these earlier crosses, you could
[SPEAKER_03]: get things in before the helicopter
started descending on your crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the hybridization between these
Afghani and narrow leaf varieties allowed
[SPEAKER_03]: for plants to be grown indoors because
they weren't 15-foot tall trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were these squat little bushes that
you could grow under lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then at that point, you saw people growing
cannabis virtually everywhere as opposed
[SPEAKER_03]: to just the most optimal climates.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could grow cannabis on the moon at
that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: That inspired a lot of people to get
involved and have a hand in developing
[SPEAKER_03]: their own varieties where they normally
wouldn't have that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that did a lot for preservation of
cannabis that we now have these little
[SPEAKER_03]: incubators going on all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also meant that the agronomic
traits became maybe more important than
[SPEAKER_03]: the chemo bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: The primary selection was for yield,
for size, and for flowering period,
[SPEAKER_03]: where earlier cannabis was more all about
the effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain varieties that had amazing effects
and positive attributes were no longer
[SPEAKER_03]: available because they just didn't make it
indoors or they just took too long to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really can't understate the influence
of Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: They brought not only the genes that
you're talking about for small stature
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and higher yield and higher resin
content, but also some of the genes for
[SPEAKER_04]: the source of the hydroxylated terpenes
comes from that Afghani side too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wouldn't have had those things
occurring in some of the more equatorial
[SPEAKER_04]: populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about some of the bad traits
that came in too, the lack of mold
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance that came along with that
compact form.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really interesting how the plants
that came into the United States
[SPEAKER_04]: predominantly, where they were being
shipped from, from when it was Mexico or
[SPEAKER_04]: Thailand or Colombia in probably the late
60s and early 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: As these more diverse sources,
people around the world looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: different sources of cannabis to import,
that's really when the Afghanica plants
[SPEAKER_04]: started flooding in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's had a major impact on the way that
not only the cannabis community is
[SPEAKER_04]: developed, but also how the plant was
grown, but the types of user experiences
[SPEAKER_04]: that were available.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark, this next question is for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you want to comment on
this picture on the right that you've
[SPEAKER_06]: provided for us here on the screen as
well, but what have been some of the major
[SPEAKER_06]: milestones in the history of cannabis
breeding in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, David Watson's curation of land
races.
[SPEAKER_05]: He and Demire is working to create single
cannabinoid plants that were then used in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan knows more about this than I do,
but that was huge to learn the plasticity
[SPEAKER_05]: of the plants through Demire's papers and
Dave's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, the removal of prohibition in
certain states for medical uses opened the
[SPEAKER_05]: door for like napro research, for example,
to set up a laboratory and start using
[SPEAKER_05]: chemical markers to drive breeding and
then be able to tease apart the different
[SPEAKER_05]: traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then obviously now with the SNP chips
coming out from Eurofins and groups like
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon CBD using that technology to really
drive that single cannabinoid model,
[SPEAKER_05]: the timelines, it's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the true innovative work was when
we started trying to create, some people
[SPEAKER_05]: get adverse effects from cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: To remove adverse effects from a product
is always a good thing to make a product
[SPEAKER_05]: safer and still provide you with the
ability to get high or find pain relief or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever it may be without paranoia,
anxiety, or different types of adverse
[SPEAKER_05]: effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a true milestone in breeding
similarly to creating a plant that
[SPEAKER_05]: produces all CBGA in a bud format.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan probably has a great perspective on
this because he sits in the captain's
[SPEAKER_05]: chair of the whole cannabis breeding thing
even back into the 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that picture at the bottom right
there was Ryan's, that's his grow right
[SPEAKER_05]: now in British Columbia, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on mute, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually a picture of Mark's
college.
[SPEAKER_04]: College closet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about David Watson's work in
the creation of the single cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties that ended up being licensed by
GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no better person to talk about it
than Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was there and right in the middle of
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell us, Rob, about how that came
about in the pursuit of the single
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid varieties and the idea that
you could explore David's wild collection
[SPEAKER_04]: for the plants that would become the
progenitors of what led to all the
[SPEAKER_04]: different cannabinoid chemistry on the
market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that got to be a big question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the GW beginning of the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing led to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not the first intent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first intent was to produce THC,
natural version of drenabinol,
[SPEAKER_01]: the registered name for delta-9-THC and
the pharmaceutical name, and produce it
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally because Marinol was based on
synthetic drenabinol, hence their easy
[SPEAKER_01]: approval as the pot pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the answer to people who smoked
cannabis saying that it was medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government could say, okay,
we have medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Marinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the active ingredients,
same thing you guys like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it got fast-tracked and that's
why it ended up where it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an easy target for a generic
equivalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was originally what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The GW thing came along later.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it all started for a little
history.
[SPEAKER_04]: GW came along because you guys found all
these different plants that had different
[SPEAKER_04]: chemistries.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were looking to set up a
pharmaceutical company and you guys were
[SPEAKER_04]: the place that had the supply,
one of the only places in the world that
[SPEAKER_04]: had this diverse chemical supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did and they basically were focused on
one compound and that was THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD was included in the program basically
because they wanted to ameliorate the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen naive user effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when an old fart like me does it
for the first time and their heart beats
[SPEAKER_01]: really fast and they go, I don't feel so
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens in all their trials,
even the ones that pass at about around
[SPEAKER_01]: 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably you can give anybody a sugar pill
in the hospital and 10% of them don't feel
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were trying to ameliorate the effects
through anecdotal evidence provided by
[SPEAKER_01]: David basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD kills your buzz and that's where it
came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that simple user knowledge led to
them using it to ameliorate those effects
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's where we ended up.
[SPEAKER_01]: On from that, then CBD became a first line
pharmaceutical, hence Epidiox.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this is a good thing, but that's the
history of how CBD ended up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_05]: To address your CBD kills your buzz,
I would say that it attenuates your buzz
[SPEAKER_05]: because if you have something that's 4 to
1 THC to CBD or 10 to 1 THC to CBD,
[SPEAKER_05]: it tends to have a much more indica
effect, knocking you onto the couch
[SPEAKER_05]: hardcore, whereas THC alone has that more,
like you said, heart-pounding effect
[SPEAKER_05]: depending.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say when you get 1 to 1 and less,
it definitely kills your buzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that we learned through
the Napro breeding programs was that we
[SPEAKER_04]: could achieve cannabinoid ratios that we
didn't find in the natural population.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those strange or altered
cannabinoid ratios, when you put them in a
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor profile that's pleasing,
that the market is used to, then you
[SPEAKER_04]: really have this new types of cannabinoid
experience that just doesn't exist or
[SPEAKER_04]: hadn't existed, I should say, up until
that point in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about how one-dimensional today's
marketplace is with just THC, but the vast
[SPEAKER_05]: majority of users of cannabis or hemp
products are really using an enhanced or
[SPEAKER_05]: type 2 product because all of the hemp is
getting sprayed with something and then
[SPEAKER_05]: getting bought and sold on the black
market going towards the Eastern or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really interesting to think that
these people going to tobacco shops are
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially smoking an enhanced product
and they're one of the biggest growth user
[SPEAKER_05]: groups in the United States right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then when you mix in THCV or, for
instance, there's cultivars that are out
[SPEAKER_05]: here that are a type 2, which means they
have THC and CBD, but they also have
[SPEAKER_05]: propyl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're talking about four cannabinoids
in the mix and if there's one plus percent
[SPEAKER_05]: CBG that you have five cannabinoids in the
mix, those cocktails really begin to
[SPEAKER_05]: create what was truly meant by the
original entourage dubbed by Mishulam,
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabinoid entourage, let alone
layering on top of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Ryan said, the OG knows or the Jack
knows, which also layers on another
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmacological piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny that these things exist and I
think that the market understands that
[SPEAKER_04]: these things can exist, that these types
of cultivars could potentially exist on
[SPEAKER_04]: the market, but their real market
penetrance is, like you said, they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: really accepted.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that go to the dispensaries
looking for their cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're usually looking for THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the right consumer education,
again, you have specific, as you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: certain combinations of cannabinoids work
great on skin irritation or, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: Sativex is a medicine for a reason and
it's not THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get into a recreational market
that's looking for functional products,
[SPEAKER_05]: consumers love Holy Crunch because they
can use it in the morning, get high,
[SPEAKER_05]: drink some coffee, and it lasts for three
hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then when they smoke their type one later
in the day, they actually get high again,
[SPEAKER_05]: whereas you smoke type one all day,
all THC, you have a tendency to taper on
[SPEAKER_05]: that getting high a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a refresher for your
endocannabinoid system or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Eddie Ray is about to publish some
interesting data on that that they've
[SPEAKER_04]: collected at one of the Oregon festivals,
cannabis consumption events, on the
[SPEAKER_04]: different preferences, chemistries,
because again, people are buying.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they go into the store, you're
overwhelmed when you go into a dispensary
[SPEAKER_04]: of choice and you don't really know how to
differentiate between the different
[SPEAKER_04]: products.
[SPEAKER_04]: The natural thing that everybody goes to
is, well, what's the highest THC?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've said that before, but I think it's
important to say again, up until even the
[SPEAKER_04]: early 2000s, that's not the way that
cannabis was purchased.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody knew about, everybody assumed that
higher THC was better, but nobody really
[SPEAKER_04]: knew.
[SPEAKER_04]: THC wasn't on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't on the label back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way that you would select the cannabis
that you'd want to buy is you'd put your
[SPEAKER_04]: nose into the bag and see what it smelled
and looked at.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't really have anything to do with
the number per se.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more judged based on the user
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've moved into this market where people
are now buying based on a number,
[SPEAKER_04]: on a metric, because that's something that
they have to grab onto.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I don't mean to divert our talk
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just great that you mentioned some of
those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: The future is definitely a more robust
cannabinoid offering and chemical
[SPEAKER_05]: offering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's shift from the past to the present
for the sake, you guys are like most
[SPEAKER_06]: growers and breeders very ambitious with
all the information that you are trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: accomplish today.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can shift a little bit, this one's
going to be for Ryan and for Mojave.
[SPEAKER_06]: Present day, what objectives drive the
thinking of today's cannabis breeders?
[SPEAKER_06]: What type of desired traits are they
looking to enhance or to alter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd say that just to follow up on
what we were just talking about,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's all about predicting what the
consumer's needs are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in this era where cannabis is now
being marketed like other products with
[SPEAKER_03]: packaging and media.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about connecting the cultivar variety
with the end user, just like what Mark was
[SPEAKER_03]: saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a cannabis variety for
everybody, but predicting what that
[SPEAKER_03]: variety is going to be is the challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finding the user that's seeking that
particular effect is extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: challenging, but cannabis does so much for
so many people that we all know that there
[SPEAKER_03]: is a variety for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of selecting cultivars and
working developing new varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to have foresight 12 months ahead
of the market and you have to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: predict where the market is moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always comes back to education.
[SPEAKER_03]: The consumer needs to be educated so that
the supply chain can meet their needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, people love purple weed for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think purple is a pretty color and it
sells well.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are driven by these associations
with other products.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got all these sweet cakes and
cookies and stuff like that, which tap
[SPEAKER_03]: into our primal love of carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got two competing fronts.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is the marketability of the product
and how you reach your consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other is actually producing and
developing varieties that address the
[SPEAKER_03]: needs of the consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that those are challenging for
breeders and challenging for cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: groups in order to align those and be able
to predict what the future cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties are going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk with cultivation groups all the
time who build up their mother blocks
[SPEAKER_03]: based off of the trends of today.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time those blocks are all
established and they're making clones and
[SPEAKER_03]: putting them into production, everything's
changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a guessing game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Change over at commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people don't realize they're
trying to stay with these trends.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time they identify a trend,
they're already midway in the trend.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time you get everything into
population, it's a year later and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can relate to that one personally.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had to identify a top three desired
traits on a breeding project, maybe a
[SPEAKER_06]: recent one, is there something that rings
out to you there?
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's pestin pathogen resistance
and the effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Effect has always been primary for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like if I had to chew a bitter pill
to get the effect that I was the desired
[SPEAKER_03]: effect, I would do that way over a
strawberry flavored Vicodin or something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's really hard to relay
to a consumer when cannabis now is so
[SPEAKER_03]: dynamic and has such an amazing aromatic
profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's all about effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was drawn to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's why people, that's our
primary concern, but now color and flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: seem to predominate, and as mentioned,
for THC content.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always felt that pestin resistance
and effect are the two primary concerns.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ryan, do you want to piggyback on some of
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, again, to look at what we've been
doing is really, Mojave calls it effect,
[SPEAKER_04]: but truly that is smell and cannabinoid
content really, or scent and cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_04]: scent flavor and cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we've been focusing on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean we, but we personally,
but we as a cannabis community has been
[SPEAKER_04]: focusing on, we haven't had the ability to
run proper breeding programs to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: lock down things like resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things take time and they take time
to learn how to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really some of the early work we
were doing at Napro was trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand the inheritance of these flavor
molecules or the scent compounds so that
[SPEAKER_04]: we could learn how to shuffle the deck to
get the desired outcome that we wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really within the last 10 years,
you could say.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way I look at the industry is we've
got this incredible genetic resource,
[SPEAKER_04]: but with corn and a lot of these other
species, all those crops were handed over
[SPEAKER_04]: to the plant nerds way at the beginning of
the crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the people that naturally
gravitated to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis really wasn't that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis got harvested and sequestered in
these disparate and remote gardens all
[SPEAKER_04]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different people were starting with
different populations and they were all
[SPEAKER_04]: cobbling together their own car that they
could just make it run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're lucky to be 20 years into that
cycle where we can start dipping into
[SPEAKER_04]: these different populations that people
have been developing on their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're able to bring these things back
together in a more organized and
[SPEAKER_04]: structured way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that when you're doing that,
the only real way to do that is to start
[SPEAKER_04]: piece by piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, when we were doing that at
Napro, we started figuring out how to
[SPEAKER_04]: shuffle the cannabinoid and the terpene
synthase genes in such a way that we could
[SPEAKER_04]: stabilize and lock those traits down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the next step is going in and
increasing, fixing properties like you're
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about, like resistances to mold or
pest or pathogens, and improving yield and
[SPEAKER_04]: stature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even a lot of these basic plant
architecture traits to do with morphology
[SPEAKER_04]: and structure for making a plant that's
ideal to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things have to be added back in one
at a time as you're building this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good analogy is to build a plane while
you're flying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabis industry doesn't have the
type of crops that other industries like
[SPEAKER_04]: corn can rely on.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to be a huge corn producer,
you go and sign a deal with Cargill or one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the big corn seed suppliers and you
plant their bulletproof corn crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: You pay them a hefty percentage of the
crop because they're providing you with a
[SPEAKER_04]: type of seed that is going to allow you to
build a really robust business model.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we're only getting to that
point in cannabis right now, or we're
[SPEAKER_04]: starting to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ryan and Mark, I think you brought up a
good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I encourage everyone to Google it if you
haven't seen it, but they have these
[SPEAKER_06]: images of every traditional commercial
crop 150 years ago and what it looks like
[SPEAKER_06]: today.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite a bit different.
[SPEAKER_06]: From my perspective, I think a lot of
people are trying to in their head at
[SPEAKER_06]: least, breed towards the utopian plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Generally, they're looking for obviously
high yield, but they're looking for other
[SPEAKER_06]: characteristics as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: One that I see people digging down on is
like calyx to leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in the business of growing for
trim flower, you probably don't want to
[SPEAKER_06]: grow a cultivar that's 40 percent trim in
a commercial setting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to be pretty common from my out
and abouts, but I see other people looking
[SPEAKER_06]: for resistance to lodging.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know people are battling trellises on
all kinds of different levels.
[SPEAKER_06]: The idea of having, in my opinion,
like a turgid plant that self-erects
[SPEAKER_06]: itself and can handle a little bit of wind
and jostle here and there versus two or
[SPEAKER_06]: three layers of trellis would really speed
up things from a labor perspective,
[SPEAKER_06]: particularly associated with harvesting,
and maybe even increase things like better
[SPEAKER_06]: contact on sprays and things of this
nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any other traits, Ryan,
Mark, in the group here that you really
[SPEAKER_06]: think are not brought into the light yet
that are critical?
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the traits that is critical for a
lot of asexual propagators is the
[SPEAKER_05]: clonability of a variety or cultivar,
if it takes root really easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you take clones, you have this high
frequency of stressed plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can reduce that population through
breeding a plant that's easily asexually
[SPEAKER_05]: propagated, that works.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing terpenes is a big focus,
even on the hemp side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the breeding programs we oversee
that cannabis-derived terpenes from hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: are proving to be a real market breaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are doing well cultivating hemp for
terpenes, as long as it's not myrcine,
[SPEAKER_05]: because all hemp is pretty much myrcine.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple lines now that are
terpenaline, but there are six terpenes
[SPEAKER_05]: that can be dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get into the limonines,
the pionines, the osimenes, and the
[SPEAKER_05]: linalool, then those essential oils really
provide the income for those hemp farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: who are struggling, who are growing for
CBD or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some plants we see exhibit reduced
branching or no branching at all,
[SPEAKER_05]: which could be useful in row crop,
similar to corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of getting Christmas tree shaped,
you just have straight spindles and for
[SPEAKER_05]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_05]: The resistance, obviously, those are big
ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flavor is huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Creating terpene profiles that didn't
exist previously, because when you looked
[SPEAKER_05]: at the cannabis market seven years ago,
you had five terpene profiles,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that was it.
[SPEAKER_05]: With help from Ryan, we've been able to
assemble terpene profiles that never
[SPEAKER_05]: exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pionine is a recessive terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anytime you hybridize it with anything,
the pionine starts going away.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to really focus on keeping
certain terpenes to be co-dominant when
[SPEAKER_05]: you breed through them.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, if you have something that's
limonine, pionine, and beta-cariophylline
[SPEAKER_05]: dominant, that really doesn't exist in the
marketplace because cariophylline and
[SPEAKER_05]: limonine squash out the pionine.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way to preserve some outlier in
that case is to have a clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you have a seed producer who has a
parental that's pionine dominant and a
[SPEAKER_05]: parental that is cariophylline and
limonine dominant, and they homozygously
[SPEAKER_05]: breed those three terpenes to be
co-dominant in the seed, then you have
[SPEAKER_05]: this new way of sharing homozygous seed
crops based on flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark, can you elaborate a little bit on
founder events and bottlenecking of gene
[SPEAKER_06]: pool?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that Ryan is the king of the
bottleneck of the gene pool because that
[SPEAKER_05]: used to be his sign-off on his email.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it the only crime against the cannabis
genome?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it self-recedent?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't sound like something I would
say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Founder events is all about consequences.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, a good one that people
understand is OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG is a great plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a great nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I would call it a great
plant, but it's got a great nose and a
[SPEAKER_04]: flower profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: From a consumer point of view,
there's a lot of things going for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you said, Michael, it's probably a
plant that needs to be multiple trellis
[SPEAKER_04]: and it takes a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you choose a plant like OG and
everybody wants to have OG, everything,
[SPEAKER_04]: OG cookies or OG whatever, when it became
popular, everybody crossed everything to
[SPEAKER_04]: OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get that high THC and you get that
nice, fuely scent profile that gets added
[SPEAKER_04]: to whatever you're breeding with,
but you also get to inherit all the bad
[SPEAKER_04]: traits that come along with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens is when the entire world
focuses on OG,
[SPEAKER_04]: when Darwin said survival of the fittest,
what he meant was survival of the genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The genes that will survive are the ones
that are passed on in the most frequency.
[SPEAKER_04]: When everybody's using OG to breed with,
those genes become over-represented in the
[SPEAKER_04]: population.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the good things that come from OG,
yeah, they come into the pool,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you also inherit all the bad things.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you only have a few individual tools
that are leading to the entire... Think
[SPEAKER_04]: about it, we're going to go to Mars and
you're going to start a new colony on
[SPEAKER_04]: Mars.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take five people, those five people
that will have a big imprint on the future
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics from everyone that comes from
them, you're overemphasizing the traits
[SPEAKER_04]: that those people have in the forming
population.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the idea that just understanding that
when you go through a bottleneck,
[SPEAKER_04]: a bottleneck means that... Think of it
like all the genes in a population are in
[SPEAKER_04]: a bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You turn the bottle upside down,
the amount of genes that can actually get
[SPEAKER_04]: through that constriction is much lower.
[SPEAKER_04]: That has an impact on the future of the
species from that point of view.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really important to remember when
you're doing things like everybody's
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding with OG that, yeah, you're
inheriting all the good characteristics,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you're also inheriting all the bad
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob writes about this in a book called...
Sorry, Advances in Hemp Research,
[SPEAKER_04]: by Paolo Ranale.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob wrote a great chapter about the plants
and the cultivars that really founded the
[SPEAKER_04]: drug gene pool, mostly being Northern
Lights, Afghani One, Skunk One,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't only those plants, it was that a
few or those what we call varieties,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was a very few individuals from those
genetic lines that were, what we say,
[SPEAKER_04]: made it interse or crossed between each of
themselves, amongst themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: The different combinations of those very
few plants for a long time had a big
[SPEAKER_04]: impact on the drug population,
the global drug population, because
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody was growing seeds from those
crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really what a founder event is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have gone through, like I said,
we've gone through that a couple of times
[SPEAKER_04]: in cannabis, once with the OGs and once at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we're always going through
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always nice when people come along
like DJ Short or these gentlemen out of
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you know them,
the Cannabis Potency Research that have
[SPEAKER_04]: this freak show plant with the weird leaf
shape.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice when someone pops up and they've
been doing their own thing and crossing
[SPEAKER_04]: within their own genetic program for say
15, 20 years, because they become isolated
[SPEAKER_04]: from all the trends that are going on in
the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are really great, what I call repair
pools or their genetic collections that we
[SPEAKER_04]: can go and draw from to reinvigorate some
of the interbreeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, remembering that cannabis is an
outcross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inbreeding is very unnatural to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we do these inbreeding events,
we have to understand that there's genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: consequences to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They went through this with corn as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not to be unexpected.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that terminology, repair pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know one of the things that we talked
about previously as a group was we're
[SPEAKER_06]: currently in a seed to clone market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of people had some strong
opinions that we're probably going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: shifting at some point to a clone to seed
market and move away from others
[SPEAKER_06]: altogether.
[SPEAKER_06]: Collectively within the panel,
I'd love to have a discussion and get some
[SPEAKER_06]: perspective on your thoughts there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Rob said, this is a seed crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't grow corn, not corn is a bad
example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very few things in agriculture do we grow
from asexual propagate if it has a hardy
[SPEAKER_05]: seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you compare the amount of
horticultural required to produce from a
[SPEAKER_05]: clone versus producing from a seed,
there's no comparison.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you grow from a clone, you have to
first propagate it, which costs money,
[SPEAKER_05]: a couple of bucks a clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you have to skirt the plants when
they get a certain age so that you focus
[SPEAKER_05]: the root to shoot ratio on the top so you
get good bud formation.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're usually susceptible to diseases
and pests that have just come along unless
[SPEAKER_05]: you have SEGRIS technology, which is
tissue culture, which cleans all the
[SPEAKER_05]: plants so that they're really nice for
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really a no-brainer when you compare
a plant with a taproot versus a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: without a taproot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really remarkable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can even grow in low light winter
conditions with no heat and still get
[SPEAKER_05]: really great bud formation and good
yields.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your pest and disease pressure goes way
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, the horticultural cost goes
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to be working with someone
who has developed seeds for the purpose of
[SPEAKER_05]: production instead of someone who takes a
strawberry kush and crosses it with a
[SPEAKER_05]: banana kush and causes a strawberry banana
kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they didn't look at the chemistry
behind those two plants and the resulting
[SPEAKER_05]: seed isn't going to be what they think it
is, all the panelists can vouch for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're just taking names and
hybridizing hybrids and hybridizing
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrids, it's the same thing over and over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even when you look across all of the
gelato, cookies, wedding cake,
[SPEAKER_05]: sunset sherbet, they're all
beta-karyophylline dominant, a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: of limonene and a little bit of other
secondaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: They basically have a very similar
aromatic profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the main drivers of what
seeds are produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan was talking about OG kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, OG kush has fallen out of favor to
the cookies family of hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in the future, as the hemp farmers
have shifted to seed, that's a great model
[SPEAKER_05]: for the cannabis farmers to shift to seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much anyone growing outdoors,
whether it's Sonoma or Santa Rosa or Santa
[SPEAKER_05]: Barbara, they're all growing from seed for
the BCC marketplace because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: make sense to pay what it costs to do the
clonal work and put it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it'd be a crap shoot if you're going
to have a fire or a windstorm or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that that model is not completely
dialed in yet, but if you had to predict a
[SPEAKER_06]: time where you see this transition being
there at the level of a Monsanto tomato
[SPEAKER_06]: seed as an example, what timeline would
you put on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have clients who have products
that currently are homozygous,
[SPEAKER_05]: very stable and perform in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're talking about a complete
catalog that's roundup ready, Monsanto has
[SPEAKER_05]: to step into the game to get roundup ready
going for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say in the next five years,
you'll see a lot more products entering
[SPEAKER_05]: the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple good autoflower seeds
that are finally starting to get better on
[SPEAKER_05]: the nose out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Molecular Farms has a couple of great
products that are autoflower and photopre
[SPEAKER_05]: dependent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably like five years and there'll be a
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say I just added that I think that
clones will always have a place.
[SPEAKER_03]: The closer we get to homozygous seeds,
it's obviously, and it depends on the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivator and where they're cultivating
and what they're cultivating.
[SPEAKER_03]: But clones and tissue culture will have
their place in the market definitely for
[SPEAKER_03]: maintaining breeding parent stock at the
very least.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some plants just are so unstable like
grapes and apples that we have to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: from clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some markets are so discerning about what
they want that they're not ready to take
[SPEAKER_03]: the even limited variability that comes
from seed crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they'll still be relevant,
but we all hope to be able to produce
[SPEAKER_03]: better seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more reliable, especially for
international markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to add that Broadacre is the
future for most of cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all cannabis, whether it's hemp or
seed or drug, it's all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will weigh in in a future question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need to think towards what
agriculture really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Broadacre agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an Australian term basically,
but it means growing crops from seed on
[SPEAKER_01]: large acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the way forward for producing
cannabinoids as just cannabinoid stock,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like it is for producing seed or
fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, we need consistent seed varieties
for that production.
[SPEAKER_01]: They exist for fiber and for seed,
but they don't exist for drug cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that really needs to
happen to really move the plant forward as
[SPEAKER_01]: a real crop plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Switching gears a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ryan, did you have a comment?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I switch gears.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say, I think that there's
a little bit of a dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Mojave was saying, there is all these
trends.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are all these trends that happen and
cultivators have to be quick to adapt.
[SPEAKER_04]: The seed process takes time.
[SPEAKER_04]: To get homozygous seed of all these really
variants, Napero is doing a great job of
[SPEAKER_04]: it, but I think that five years is
probably pushing the envelope a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of worldwide acceptance from most
cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 10 to 15 years is probably a more
realistic number of when people are going
[SPEAKER_04]: to start really planting the majority of
cannabis drug crops from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least those that are grown for flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're growing for extract,
it doesn't matter as much, but the flower
[SPEAKER_04]: market really depends on these colonial
productions.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that going to seed would solve a
lot of the problems like Mark was talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are tons of advantages, but the
truth is, like I said, we're building this
[SPEAKER_04]: plane as we're flying it from parts that
all these different growers have cobbled
[SPEAKER_04]: together over the last 20, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes time to develop those plants that
are what I call bulletproof plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the corn of today where you can plant
a field of 1,000 plants or more,
[SPEAKER_04]: 10,000 plants and they all look the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: To make breeding parents that are stable
to get to that point where you can start
[SPEAKER_04]: creating those hybrids, it takes time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just pushing on a little bit too because I
know Q&A is a hot topic always on these
[SPEAKER_06]: webinars.
[SPEAKER_06]: As the market evolves, leading producers
and brands are taking increasingly
[SPEAKER_06]: sophisticated approaches to curating
cultivar menus, particularly in the new
[SPEAKER_06]: booming recreational markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen this time and time again where
people will go spend $25, $50,
[SPEAKER_06]: $500 million and build out a facility and
then you talk to them about their genetic
[SPEAKER_06]: portfolio and what their plan is there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like this afterthought.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, we're going to buy five or $10,000
worth of seeds and hunt through some
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess what should a producer's genetic
portfolio management look like
[SPEAKER_06]: pre-operational and operational?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's open for all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: What makes up a ideal genetic portfolio
for a modern company today?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I would start off by saying probably
just Ryan's catalog.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big statement.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could pull up those three phyto
facts, this is a great segue to just show
[SPEAKER_05]: how you can have diversity within a
dispensary or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are all products that are on the
shelf in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea is that in the future,
you'll be looking at phyto facts.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are report formats for different
cultivars being grown in California and
[SPEAKER_05]: sold in the recreational marketplaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: SC Labs now produces these for cultivators
so you can have a better standard of
[SPEAKER_05]: quality control because you have your
terpene profile that's color coded
[SPEAKER_05]: semi-intuitively.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you notice on the left, you have the
happy pineapple cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a true, it smells like pineapple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pineapple Express never really smelled
like pineapple.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just the name, but this plant has
28 plus percent cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has 20% THC with like 8% CBG,
but the dominant terpene is osamine and
[SPEAKER_05]: beta-carotene with limonene and pining,
and it is really bright and pineapple-y.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you go to the far right, which is
Space Force One, it's 32% cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_05]: 30% THC, limonene dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a gassy back end, but a limony
front end.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then something in the middle that kind of
smells like cookies is Holy Crunch,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's one-to-one THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a host of consumers tools on this
report format that dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_05]: budtenders can learn from and understand
how to direct a new user, like Rob
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioned, or the OG who just wants the
30% THC, but also gives the consumer
[SPEAKER_05]: useful information about the product and
how it's going to make them feel,
[SPEAKER_05]: how it's going to taste, how it's going to
smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then once you begin creating a whole menu
that is based off of terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_05]: because if you create a spectrum from the
warm-colored tones to the cool-colored
[SPEAKER_05]: tones, on the phytophagy of red,
orange, and yellow, those are warm colors,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then the purples and blues are cool
tones.
[SPEAKER_05]: The warm kind of tie into those
sativa-like effects, the cool tones
[SPEAKER_05]: associate with the indica-like effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a mixture of the colors,
those are hybrid-like effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we look at plants, we look at them
from their morphology.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're looking at biotech seed catalog,
you'll have indica, sativa, and hybrid for
[SPEAKER_05]: the structure of the plant, like Rob was
talking, thin leaf, fat leaf, short and
[SPEAKER_05]: squatty, tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you have the effects, the terpene
entourage, indica, sativa, and hybrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what these phytofacts do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really great tools for breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to the next slide, please,
Michael.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a small shot of a seed population.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's four different sets of bar charts,
but as you can see, each individual
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivar is numbered 14, 21, 22,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at the second bar chart down
with the orange and green bars,
[SPEAKER_05]: the orange is the absolute terpene
concentration, and the green is the
[SPEAKER_05]: absolute cannabinoid concentration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the next bar chart under shows the
relative terpene profiles, and then the
[SPEAKER_05]: bar chart under that shows minor molecules
and most people don't even look at,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they definitely- Oh, look,
it's unlabeled.
[SPEAKER_05]: It truly affects the nose, and it's really
neat.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an example of an F2.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to get diversity in the
terpene profile, but if you look at number
[SPEAKER_05]: 19, it has four and a half percent terps
and 20-some plus cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the clear winners of this
group.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes you a little bit of time to look
at these and actually understand what
[SPEAKER_04]: they're looking at, but really,
if people focus in on the two middle rows
[SPEAKER_04]: of the rainbow row and the orange and the
green one, the orange is, correct me if
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wrong, Mark, but orange is
cannabinoids and the green is terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the opposite, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you can really easily look at a
population and start to see number six for
[SPEAKER_04]: example, is obviously low in both
cannabinoids and terpenoids, but you can
[SPEAKER_04]: look at the ones with the high peaks and
start seeing the ones that have the high
[SPEAKER_04]: levels of terpenoids and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can even look at the ratios between
those compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really informative way to look at
an entire population rather than looking
[SPEAKER_04]: at individual lab reports one at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The phytofacts make this possible and the
guys that are growing the strawberry
[SPEAKER_05]: banana kush are breeding that product.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have access to tools like this,
but we're planning on helping SC Labs make
[SPEAKER_05]: this a product of the future for cannabis
breeders so we can help move the industry
[SPEAKER_05]: forward a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: These tools have been awesome in helping
molecular farms and others create truly
[SPEAKER_05]: novel products in the marketplace that
taste great, have a great experience,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's truly tailored breeding when you
break it down to the chemicals like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and if you go back to the slide
before where you're showing the happy
[SPEAKER_04]: pineapple, most people won't tell by
looking at these lab reports because when
[SPEAKER_04]: they're new to you, it takes a little bit
of time to read them, but once you've seen
[SPEAKER_04]: a thousand of them, those plants that are
up on the... I don't know if you can go
[SPEAKER_04]: back to it, Michael, but those plants that
were on the previous slide,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're pretty interesting plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that happy pineapple is a pretty
cool plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: 28% cannabinoids, 8% CBG with that terpene
profile high in osamine and it looked like
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a bunch of other little miners in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you got some limonene and some
pineene and some beta-cariophylline.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's a cool plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that osamine came from bag seed of
Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_05]: From 1994.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not from the Pinchers line then.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's from the... This ended up
getting crossed with a blue moonshine and
[SPEAKER_05]: then flow and then back across to the
Hawaiian parent and yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ short stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more the early flower and the
structure because DJ stuff often was
[SPEAKER_05]: really early.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I really liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to see this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Phytofax is such a powerful tool and
for breeders and ultimately for consumers,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really what kind of the
underlining theme here, consumer
[SPEAKER_03]: education.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that SC Labs is doing this
with Napro and that the Emerald Cup is now
[SPEAKER_03]: has a terpene class awards, which
really... The cannabis awards really
[SPEAKER_03]: drives the market in a big way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that we're gonna see people
acknowledging these different terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: classes and hopefully eventually the
retail outlets also realizing that they
[SPEAKER_03]: need to have a representational variety
for all these different terpene and minor
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great that they're finally doing
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2014 or 2013, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's great that they're finally
doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like I always use the example
of a dog show, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like what we do now is kind of like
best in show, but they'd also say what the
[SPEAKER_04]: best Labrador or the best Poodle is,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you can actually start judging
cannabis amongst samples that are similar
[SPEAKER_04]: to that type, I mean, that's quite
interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like the IPA versus a Porter versus
a Stout.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's the natural way where Merlot
versus a Cabernet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just so everybody knows, SC Labs did a
great job on their website.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys wanna check out the fight of
facts, they put together a video and all
[SPEAKER_05]: kinds of stuff, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just also interesting how the
Cultivation Classic Awards out of Oregon,
[SPEAKER_03]: their terpene class excludes Mircene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like... Yeah, they're just like,
we're not even gonna try it because
[SPEAKER_03]: otherwise the market is dominated with
Mircene dominant varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to talk about other terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Mircene's not even on the grass list,
so stay away from that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: 2018, they pulled it off the grass list,
yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am going to push us forward a little
bit here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last question, and then we're gonna get
into Q&A.
[SPEAKER_06]: What concerns should producers have when
planning for new genetics?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had discussed educating and
consumers through retail training and
[SPEAKER_06]: education.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also how does geographic location and
regulatory climate affect some of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulation is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just gonna say it's huge,
especially in the international market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you look at all these new
countries that are coming online,
[SPEAKER_03]: they wanna grow popular varieties,
but they might not have the right climate
[SPEAKER_03]: for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might not have the right regulatory
structure to allow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm biased as a international
vendor of seed genetics and clone shipping
[SPEAKER_04]: around the world, but I really feel like
in order to be successful, you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: partner with a group that knows what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to do your whole genetic program on
your own is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, if you're gonna enter the
tomato or the farm market, and you wanna
[SPEAKER_04]: be a producer, you're not gonna go and
collect your own land, raise seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: and start trying to put together a
breeding program and make your own tomato.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna go to a known producer that
has a reliable crop that you can rely on
[SPEAKER_04]: to support your business model,
and you're gonna make a contract with
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a lot of these markets, what they'll do
is they'll allow a producer to have like a
[SPEAKER_04]: two or three week window where the
regulator kinda looks the other way,
[SPEAKER_04]: and whatever genetics end up in your
facility, they end up your facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once that period is over, you're
locked down, and you can only trade
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics or buy genetics from other people
that operate within your system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that creates challenges for producers
that are always trying to create something
[SPEAKER_04]: new and stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because any given producer only has a
footprint of say 100X, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have to take 25X of that 100
and dedicate it to veg space, you now only
[SPEAKER_04]: have three or 75X of the rest of that
space to use for production.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we start taking away some of that
space to do R&D to try and develop that
[SPEAKER_04]: new new all the time, like we're saying,
a lot of these places might wanna roll out
[SPEAKER_04]: a new cultivar every two or three months
so that they can stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's tough to do that all on your own
while you're trying to run a business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think North America especially is
becoming quite lucky as we envision full
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization in the States probably in the
next five years with the new
[SPEAKER_04]: administration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe that allows interstate commerce
and potentially commerce within the North
[SPEAKER_04]: American block, where Canada and the
United States can trade genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada is already able to do international
business because we're fully legalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Sega for example, just released news
that they were shipping some genetics over
[SPEAKER_04]: to a company in Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the movement of genes is becoming
more commonplace, but really having a
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic supplier that is gonna be able to
support a diverse menu, I think is really
[SPEAKER_04]: critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean stock, I'd add into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked with groups, some in fully
regulated countries, they usually don't
[SPEAKER_03]: allow for immaculate conception.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all material has to come in with the
phytosanitary certificate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've already heard new emerging
markets that have been completely infected
[SPEAKER_03]: and impacted by hoplite and viroid,
that they brought in seed stock and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: already spread throughout their whole
facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: So- It's happening in Canada too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're not supposed to have cross
border clone shipments, but it happens,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen broad mites now in a couple
of Canadian facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those of you that don't know,
broad mites aren't really indigenous to
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a result of people bringing up
cuttings outside of the system and outside
[SPEAKER_04]: of the regulations, not only the cannabis
act regulations, but we have regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: on the international regulations on the
movement of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what Mojave just mentioned,
this whole concept of phytosanitary
[SPEAKER_04]: certification.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when people operate outside those
regulations, there's consequences.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be careful, it's important to be really
careful of who your genetic suppliers are
[SPEAKER_04]: because not only on the genetic,
not only the genetic comes into your
[SPEAKER_04]: facility, also any bugs that are on that
plant material come into your facility and
[SPEAKER_04]: it can absolutely devastate your business.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have the cannabis aphid up there,
Ryan?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen it yet, but I'm sure it's
on its way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen about every pest in Canada at
this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so my takeaways there were validate
your partners or your resources.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clean stock program is critical and
divergent portfolio.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that'll give you enough building
blocks for a good start to create whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: it is that's in your vision.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is where I have to leave you the
cliffhanger.
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as we want to talk about
incredible things like marker-assisted
[SPEAKER_06]: selection, predictive breeding programs,
pangenomes, and, and, and that's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: have to be for part two.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this point, we'll transition to Q&A.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to all audience members that
provided questions ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're able to select a few, so we'll get
started there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can grab some out of the chat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mojave, Ryan, Rob, Mark, if there's any
questions in the chat, that you find
[SPEAKER_06]: particularly interesting, go ahead and
just, you know, we'll pull them up after
[SPEAKER_06]: these next couple ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the first questions we had is,
do you think hybrid seed will displace
[SPEAKER_06]: traditional clonal propagation systems?
[SPEAKER_06]: We've already covered that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're all excited for that when
it's, when it's ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second one is a little bit more for
part two, but I thought it would be an
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting little teaser if anyone's got
some experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: But has anyone on the panel performed
double haploid breeding techniques to
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're on mute, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we played with a bunch of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big, that's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, that's not, it's more than just
spraying a plant with STS, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a quite involved process and we've
played around with it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't have any products.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really R&D at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, I would say that again, is 10 years
away from a reliable workable system where
[SPEAKER_04]: we're starting to see people generate
lines derived from diabetes.
And we've seen that happen on theAMeeee.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, I think we're going to end the
presentation here.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's anything else we need to ask.
Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: My I'll jump in first, because it's going
to need modification by my peers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, if you start with a female,
and I can't really describe to you exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what a female is, but an XX female with no
intersex tendencies, and then you use it
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce male pollen, then you're
probably good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the varieties we have are
somehow sexually unstable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't really explain that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan knows more about that than I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a great paper just released by a
group in Canada that they actually sprayed
[SPEAKER_04]: STS on a plant and looked at an induced
gene response, looked at the genes that
[SPEAKER_04]: were altered in their expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a whole list of 120 potential
candidates that also seem to make sense as
[SPEAKER_04]: genes for possible targets to be involved
in intersexuality.
[SPEAKER_04]: People got to be able to separate male and
female-ness from intersex-ness.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're different traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they overlap in the way that we
experience them and the way that we see
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the truth is that they're separate
traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have male plants or female plants
that are predisposed or not predisposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: intersexuality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens is when we breed those
plants, when we self-plant, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: really what we're most often doing when we
use STS, all we're doing is increasing the
[SPEAKER_04]: frequency of those genes in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would argue that it's not the STS
itself that is causing intersex issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that using STS allows us to execute
breeding programs with tighter levels of
[SPEAKER_04]: inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's that inbreeding that is exposing
these traits that are buried in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said earlier, cannabis being an
obligate out-crosser, what that means is
[SPEAKER_04]: that plants accumulate genetic mutations.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no drive to push those genetic
mutations out of the population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we do subsequently do things
like use STS to create these type
[SPEAKER_04]: inbreeding schemes, those rare genetic
mutations are more likely to pop their
[SPEAKER_04]: head and show us expressions that we
didn't know were already buried in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's more likely the
outcome is that we're seeing these things
[SPEAKER_04]: occur as a result of the breeding system
rather than creating these things
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout practices.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and just from our experience across
every chemo type and many, many latitudes
[SPEAKER_05]: and environments, the environment plays a
huge role in stress-induced stamina and
[SPEAKER_05]: flower production.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if you do great breeding,
there is this opportunity for a cold night
[SPEAKER_05]: or a photo period disruption or shitty
root conditions that will create a stamina
[SPEAKER_05]: flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once that plant produces a stamina
flower, it's hard to get that to stop
[SPEAKER_05]: expressing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you take a clone off of a plant that
you've stressed, then you take a clone off
[SPEAKER_05]: of that plant and veg and your whole
colonial stock has the central came from a
[SPEAKER_05]: single plant that was stressed one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That stress could be enough to induce that
stamina flower production every time you
[SPEAKER_05]: go into flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: Teasing that apart is, that's a hairball.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's genetic, what's epigenetic,
but yeah, it definitely can happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, one of the benefits of seed,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you'd hope a lot of those things
were reset when you go to seed,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there are also epigenetic changes that
are passed on from generations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next question, where do you think the
cannabinoid and terpene conversation will
[SPEAKER_06]: be five years from now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Will THC and CBD still be dominant?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if so, where do we think their maximum
potential for peak residents are?
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen a lot of 30% THC cannabis in
the last five years or so, but where is
[SPEAKER_06]: that limit?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're right up against it.
[SPEAKER_05]: 35 to 35% total cannabinoid is really
pushing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really high number.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see it regularly, but it's a small
percentage of the cultivars and things
[SPEAKER_05]: being bred.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's more interesting than just absolute
cannabinoid or terpene content is how they
[SPEAKER_05]: are not correlated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can have something that has a whole
lot of cannabinoid and not a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: terpene or a whole lot of terpene and not
a whole lot of cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or both a whole lot of cannabinoid and a
whole lot of terpene or not very much of
[SPEAKER_05]: either.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fact that they're not correlated is
really cool because it means that now that
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabinoids are up to 35% and
probably pretty maxed out based on the
[SPEAKER_05]: structure of the plant, unless we create
some new plant that just basically grows a
[SPEAKER_05]: giant mushroom shaped trichome that fills
up with 80% THC, you can still drive the
[SPEAKER_05]: terpene content up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can add that flavor piece to those
30% THC products.
[SPEAKER_04]: This comes up with chemists in the
Canadian space often.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people don't believe that those
things aren't correlated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you and I know that because
again, we've been looking at breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people get their data from the
marketplace and in the marketplace they
[SPEAKER_04]: are correlated.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I agree with you in that there's gonna
be something to be said both in the
[SPEAKER_04]: extract category and in the flower market
for plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants that are in the lower cannabinoid
or what we call the mid tier cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: content, the teens, 10 to 20% and higher
levels of terpenes and terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's gonna, like you said,
it's gonna allow people to create a space
[SPEAKER_04]: where they're not getting whacked out on
THC or overloaded with THC too early in
[SPEAKER_04]: the day, but are still able to access that
flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd like to think that in the future
we're gonna be looking at kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: devil in the details that some of these
compounds, the relationship with each
[SPEAKER_03]: other are so critical that very small
infinitesimal amounts of various minor
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids and terpenes are actually
contributing a huge effect to the overall
[SPEAKER_03]: ensemble effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the second violin and the third oboe
in there that really may be making the
[SPEAKER_03]: song what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a question about, I guess,
and it really kind of comes back to
[SPEAKER_06]: Holland.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I remember when I was going to
Amsterdam as a young kid, I was considered
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of crazy for rolling up a pure joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of stuff was mixed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It also seemed like a lot of the general
cannabinoid profiles, I don't wanna say
[SPEAKER_06]: they were low, but they were kind of lower
compared to common day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say maybe with the exception of maybe
some amnesia, haze or something like that,
[SPEAKER_06]: but most of the stuff seemed to be kind of
in that mid-level cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And when and where did it change where we
started seeing these really elevated
[SPEAKER_06]: spikes of what I'll call extreme THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the cultural background in the
Netherlands is that they were hashish
[SPEAKER_01]: smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way you smoked hashish discreetly
and just without having a low volume pipe
[SPEAKER_01]: of some sort, which is American thing,
North American thing, you rolled them in
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people smoked and the obvious
no brainer way to do it was to mix this
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes not that flammable hashish into
a tobacco and dilute it a bit and make it
[SPEAKER_01]: not so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also the tobacco has its own
physiological effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people become highly accustomed to
smoking with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without it, they find it difficult to
get high even if somebody rolls a pure
[SPEAKER_01]: joint like you were trying to do and it's
the best thing you can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Dutchies would smoke it and really not
get high until they rolled one of their
[SPEAKER_01]: own or just smoked some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cigarette and then suddenly they're
bombed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there was that it was both cultural
in that that's why they did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also had a certain profound effect
that North Americans generally haven't
followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's the history of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a question for each one of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the cultivar that, in your
opinion, kind of changed the landscape or
[SPEAKER_06]: had the most impact on the cannabis
industry and breeding in general?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll start with you, Mojave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the cultivar that had the most
impact for me was Hays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because that kind of rekindled my
childhood love affair for that particular
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid profile and chirping profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd say and I think that everyone else
might agree that skunk one definitely had
[SPEAKER_03]: a profound effect on cannabis and that it
was kind of a backbone variety for a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Dutch seed companies and helped to
kind of rein in a lot of other varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: like Hays, for instance, into a more
workable line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that question for me is in
what era?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would agree with you both Hays
and skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty hard to miss the impact that
Kush has had in the marketplace over the
[SPEAKER_04]: last 15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that to me, cannabis is kind
of fashion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these trends will come and go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there'll always be people looking back
to the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, bell bottoms come around every
10 years or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: People start wearing them again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that will too will be
true with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I see it as a as an evolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's always going to be something
new that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's part of the beauty of it is
really, to me is not focused on whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: is the most highest selling thing of the
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's interesting for business
reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, go out there and experience
the diversity that the cannabis plant has
[SPEAKER_04]: to offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of great flavors and great
effects that that she has hidden within.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bag seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bag seed, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same same thing for us in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, you know, the purple Kush was
killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: The super skunk came through and it was
killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, when I first moved out
to California in early 2000s, it was every
[SPEAKER_05]: it was purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it went to OG and then it went to
cookies and just those all are all great
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Mojave mentioned everybody likes
purple, except for the cultivators,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it takes like twice as long to
grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like a lot of the perps lines
take forever to veg into something
[SPEAKER_05]: meaningful, especially kins or or
granddaddy or purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next question is, will breeders be able to
breed cannabis varieties with extra long
[SPEAKER_06]: tricones several times larger than ones
today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always felt that the Northern Lights
lineage looked sparklier than it was
[SPEAKER_01]: because it had such long trichome stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heads weren't any any larger than than
normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the density of trichomes on the
calyxes wasn't Brack's better term.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the density on the Brack's was was not
any higher, but they look really sparkly
[SPEAKER_01]: because those extensions of the leaf
surface that are the stalks, they also
[SPEAKER_01]: glisten.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't other than I'm not sure why
you'd want longer stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a hashish maker, the largest
proportion of trash you have in your dry
[SPEAKER_01]: sift is the bloody stalks, even after your
sophisticated enough to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_01]: green leaf particles, you still have the
stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just like to have varieties
where the heads fall off easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares how long the stalks are?
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be well, that was a question from
from David, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, OK, hi, David.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I think his idea is coming from he
wants to be able to pick him straight off
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant and peel it like a grape and
just dip it in his in his in his dab rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it comes down to, you know,
we do have some plants that are slightly
[SPEAKER_04]: larger sizes and Marcus Richardson,
who's here, knows a lot about this from
[SPEAKER_04]: the amount of hash he's made.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think probably it comes with,
you know, if you get a bigger gland,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to have less of them per
square millimeter.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like we said, 35 percent cannabinoid
content.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you include oil content in there,
we're looking at upwards of like we're not
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe not upwards, but we're approaching
five or 40 percent by weight total of oil
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabinoids and turpenoids in a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a that's a pretty oily,
oily plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from overall, from a chemical
output, that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would say earlier,
we're not going to push those firewalls
[SPEAKER_01]: much farther.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no other plant, the opium poppy,
any other plant that produces a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And such proliferous amounts, it's
absolutely incredible.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of botanists don't even believe
it's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think we're all high and all the
research is weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I really wonder, you know,
because that's an awful lot of of
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary metabolite to get out of any any
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And having said that and thinking about
the future of being able to hack the
[SPEAKER_05]: genome and, you know, there's a common a
common synthase and alloptoic acid
[SPEAKER_05]: synthase between cannabis and
streptomyces.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we actually use streptomyces to
produce, you know, bleomycin, which is an
[SPEAKER_05]: anti-cancer agent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the right type of funding,
I mean, you know, and knowledge base.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Seth's group is probably light
years ahead on this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like you could gene edit and very
easily create different molecules for
[SPEAKER_05]: different reasons in a very efficient way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know this is a never ending
conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people in the audience are all pretty
rock star as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been great to kind of moderate
for you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are at that point where we're going to
wrap it up and leave you guys with kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: more to think about.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of many series.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we look forward to everyone attending.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be recorded.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be put up on, I think,
YouTube and some other channels.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you had to leave early or if you
want to watch some things and learn some
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff again, that'll be available.
[SPEAKER_06]: And without further ado, I will just want
to thank everyone on the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I really appreciate the
intel and insights that you'll have after
[SPEAKER_06]: all the collective years of experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank Sega as well for
hosting.
