[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most difficult aspects of
cannabis cultivation is learning how to
[SPEAKER_01]: use light at an expert level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun is pretty much always the same and
reliable, and that's one of the reasons I
[SPEAKER_01]: prefer greenhouse growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, most artificial light sources
traditionally used for cannabis certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: got the job done, even though they were
inefficient and gave off a ton of heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the application of light to plants,
whether it be from sunshine or
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity, actually is just one part of
the skill set a cannabis cultivator needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand in order to perfect their
craft.

[SPEAKER_01]: Today, my guest is former NASA lighting
engineer Robert Soler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Robert Soler has worked at the Kennedy
Space Center where he helped design and
[SPEAKER_01]: build the cultivation module and the first
LED light for the use on the International
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, he served as a subject
matter expert for NASA's Circadian
[SPEAKER_01]: Lighting System.
[SPEAKER_01]: He holds a master's degree from the
Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer
[SPEAKER_01]: Polytechnic Institute and has begun a Ph
.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: in Behavioral Neuroscience where he
received a fellowship from the National
[SPEAKER_01]: Science Foundation for Investigation in
Circadian Lighting Paradigms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Robert is presently Vice President of
Biological Technologies and Research at
[SPEAKER_01]: BIOS Lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: On today's show, we're gonna talk about
some of the key threshold points in the
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship between the light spectrum
and cannabis plants that impact all
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators, clear up some botanical myths
that persist in cannabis cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and talk a bit about how working under
artificial lights impacts the lives of
[SPEAKER_01]: professional indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Robert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you're a busy guy,
and I appreciate that you take some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that valuable time and share it with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate that you've got,
you know, the NASA space station in your
[SPEAKER_01]: background because it's an interest of
mine having worked on the space shuttle
[SPEAKER_01]: program and the space station myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just generally think it's really
cool still.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so before we go into a lot of the more
light and botanical questions I've got for
[SPEAKER_01]: you today, would you just tell us about
the grow op in the space station?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I worked on a project called ABERS,
which is an advanced biological research
[SPEAKER_02]: system that grew Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was on the team that worked on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My role is the LED lighting expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it wasn't probably as sexy
or anything that this audience cares too
[SPEAKER_02]: much about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Arabidopsis is pretty cool because
it's almost like the white mouse of
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of experiments, a lot of
fundamental science is done with
[SPEAKER_02]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of groundbreaking research
for growing plants in outer space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of evolved into growing
flowers on space station, growing
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables and herbs on space station.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things that are good for us both
nutritionally and psychologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when I think about the space
station, I'm thinking about everything
[SPEAKER_01]: being incredibly compact.
[SPEAKER_01]: How large is the growing area?
[SPEAKER_01]: And were you finding that you were having
to devise smaller versions of the
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies just to get them on the
station?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly what NASA loved about
LED specifically was that it was small it
[SPEAKER_02]: was, you know, you could put it in pretty
much any form factor you wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was rugged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it goes up on a rocket or a Soyuz
rocket, it's going to last.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not made of glass or anything,
it's very rugged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but the team that we had was it was
basically the space flight experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: team.
[SPEAKER_02]: So astronauts, I'm not sorry, astronauts,
you know, scientists would come from all
[SPEAKER_02]: over the world and basically to fly their
science on space station, they would come
[SPEAKER_02]: to us and we would basically develop the
hardware and shrink it down to what's
[SPEAKER_02]: called a mid deck locker sized box,
where that experiment would run.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, you have, you know,
minimal space to, to have all your HVAC,
[SPEAKER_02]: your cooling, your nutrient deployment,
your lights, everything was all kind of in
[SPEAKER_02]: a really, really compressed space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And astronauts would be able to open it
up, kind of check on everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're camera based, it was all
very high tech, trying to get as much
[SPEAKER_02]: science we can autonomously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so yeah, and as compact as you could
imagine, and of course, lightweight,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think things cost about $10,000
a pound to send into space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So weight is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think most of us who picture
plants growing in space from either movies
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or just you know, imagination,
we imagine there being, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a table somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got, it's got green plants
growing out of it that are just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like in the air and sharing air with the
astronauts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is everything all like super sealed
behind plastic because every all the
[SPEAKER_01]: environments are separate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, they want they, you don't want
any cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: You everything's an experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really not designed for,
you know, life support at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really just, it wants to have its
closed environment, it's gasketed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever is going on and recirculating
in, in this one environment doesn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't commingle with, you know,
any of the other, you know, hundreds of
[SPEAKER_02]: experiments that are going on at the exact
same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd assume that you guys are probably
running some kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: rock will substrate and feeding liquid
nutrition rather than any kind of living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, which would have a ton of variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, so it's, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the nutrition system is all kind of
predetermined, some of the stuff that was
[SPEAKER_02]: that's recently done is in these little
pods, these soil pods where all the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients is already contained in inside
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to syringe in water,
because as you know, water in microgravity
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't doesn't go where you want it to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to have a very specific
delivery system to make sure that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: getting into so everything is very well
contained in order for it to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you also worked on the the grow lab in
Antarctica, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so they were looking in, it was the
McMurdo Sound Station grow facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were looking to kind of see if they
could go into LED technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did this probably about eight years
ago, growing the fresh fruits and
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables that are on there, down there
in Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I'm sure they're thrilled to do
anything to get fresh fruits and
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables there since everything's
shipped in like a couple times a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably get really, really tired of
whatever their version of MREs are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was really important from a from
a psychological mental stability
[SPEAKER_02]: standpoint, to see something growing,
to see kind of some semblance of like
[SPEAKER_02]: what's what's normal in most people's
perception.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just think that we talked a
lot about space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's one thing that's
really fascinating about space is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we look at the spectrum of light
and kind of going back to the what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're going to be talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, plants are hyper efficient
to to red light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we now know kind of it's a balance of
red and blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the first discoveries about
kind of phototropism is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you grow plants in space under only red
light, plants grow in every single
[SPEAKER_02]: direction, they don't have any up or down,
they just kind of they just grow outward,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just adding a little bit of blue
light gives them some orientation,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that they'll actually grow up towards
the light, because otherwise they have
[SPEAKER_02]: really no understanding there's no
gravity, there's no buoyancy to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: tell them what's up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, blue light tells them which way
to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's a really
interesting story as we kind of think
[SPEAKER_02]: about, you know, how we deliver blue light
here on Earth and in more normal
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe even strategically how it could
be used, you know, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know this to be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just positing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, you know, maybe red light will
give you a a shorter bushier plant that's
[SPEAKER_01]: growing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether whereas feeding it more blue light
will make it more erect is I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I bet you there's lots of people
researching that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's it's actually kind of the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue light is kind of the the natural
signal for for more light availability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're depleted of blue light,
plants will actually grow out longer and
[SPEAKER_02]: stemier to try to search for kind of more
light availability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so so it's actually a blue depleted
light will will create a longer,
[SPEAKER_02]: stemmier, kind of lanky looking plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so that's generally why a lot of the
strategies are around kind of a blue
[SPEAKER_02]: enriched early in the early stages of
plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and make our transition
to the stuff that I asked you to come and
[SPEAKER_01]: join us with, because while, you know,
you are an LED specialist for both,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, your company BIOS and formerly
for NASA, the things that that I've heard
[SPEAKER_01]: you interview about, which I'm most
interested is actually the relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: between the light, no matter its source
and the plant as a living organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this time of year,
a lot of people have got transition
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns from taking their plants from the
indoors and moving them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of us are talking about light
cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go ahead and start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So indoors, the lights are weaker than the
sunshine, but the day is usually longer
[SPEAKER_01]: before because most folks have their
lights on 18 six or 24 zero to help get
[SPEAKER_01]: them established and getting growing
before they go outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often when the plants go outside into
the more intense sunshine, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this time of year, depending on where you
are in the country, it's about 15 nine,
[SPEAKER_01]: they start to flower for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know there's clearly a relationship
between the day length, the light
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity and flowering, but you know,
for so many of us, we try to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: where that threshold is to cause flowering
so we can better manage our cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somewhere in there between like taking
a plant from 18 six and bringing it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: die outside to 15 nine, somewhere in
there, there is the threshold where,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, now, now your plants you brought
outside are going to go into flower versus
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, your plants transitioned outside
without flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of like teach us a bit about
that so that we can make better
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation management decisions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it comes down to exactly what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think the interaction with light
intensity is, is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I, you know, the evidence points
that photo period really drives,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all of that kind of seasonal
queue of when to start flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, plants are, are basically
going to strategize around taking all the
[SPEAKER_02]: energy from the summer months.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see a long day, they think of it as
summer month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then when you shorten that period,
that photo period, it's thinking it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to interpret, interpret that
information as, okay, now the seasons have
[SPEAKER_02]: changed and this is fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the time where I'm going to
take all the energy that I've created,
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've harvested from the summer months
and convert it into flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it really is that transition from a
long day to a short day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so as long as, um, what you see,
so if 15 nine is what you get outside,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and that was compared to, you know,
uh, 18 six, as you said before,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, that, that might elicit a flowering
event.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was 15 nine inside and 59 outside,
it won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that when you, you know,
if you think about how you want to do
[SPEAKER_02]: this, when you convert from inside to
outside, think about what that photo
[SPEAKER_02]: period is going to be when you take it
outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and do you want to, you know,
elicit flowering at that time or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't, you want to basically
set that time period inside to be similar
[SPEAKER_02]: to a photo period that you're going to see
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the million dollar question of
course is what is the similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if 18 six to 15 nine is very much going
to be a precipitous drop to cause
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, how close to 15 nine would you
say we want to get to be sure that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to lose our clones by suddenly
kicking them off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so, um, so what you, I mean,
what you want to do is, um, you really
[SPEAKER_02]: want to make sure that you hit it all the
way, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, usually what people do is,
is a 12 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know, it's, it's a,
it's a relative difference, but I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that if you really want to do it,
if you really want to initiate flowering,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a 12 12 is what you kind of want to
shift over to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think, um, you know, there's
going to be something really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, you know, hacks that get you
all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that, um, what I've seen,
at least in the literature is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, different strains come from
different regions and their seasonalities
[SPEAKER_02]: are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, what's going to change,
uh, initiate the, the flowering response
[SPEAKER_02]: for one species, uh, might be different
than another species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that really there are ways to,
you know, if you want to elicit flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 12 is going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you want to kind of play with the
different thresholds, I think that that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, that's something that's really
interesting to see how those impacts,
[SPEAKER_02]: how those, um, photo period effects are
going to change, you know, the product
[SPEAKER_02]: that you, that you put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the idea of where the cultivar is
from is a really interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The equatorial strains of cannabis may
well you know, have different lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: responses than the, you know, the
mountainous ones or the Pakistani Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let me ask you the question in a
slightly different way though,
[SPEAKER_01]: because normally for most of us who are
coming outside right now, we're not trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to, um, cause them to flower as we take
them outside because really we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: let the, we're going to let the natural
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to let them do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, depending on where we live
in the country and the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultivar, it'll all start kicking in
around, you know, mid ish of August,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for most of us, we're, we're taking,
you know, 12, 18 inch plants outside now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we want them to veg for another couple
months and, and double or triple in size
[SPEAKER_01]: or more, um, before it flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, you know, I tell people,
you know, if you can try to have your
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers at 15 nine before you take them
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem is, is like almost nobody
does that because a lot of people they'll,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll start their, they'll pop their
seeds or start the clones at 24 zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or many people at 18 six, but then the
time from when they start their plants at
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 six and suddenly they're going outside
at 15 nine, you know, it's hard to step
[SPEAKER_01]: down that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for myself, I tried to step them
down, you know, about a half hour a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that after, after I've, I've had them
inside for, um, you know, a month or six
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks, I've brought it down two or three
hours, but every time I drop it down a
[SPEAKER_01]: half hour, I'm like concerned that I'm
going to accidentally flower them indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with, with overlooking that whole
challenge, where do you think it's best
[SPEAKER_01]: for us to, to, to, to play with our
particular cultivars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that they think that it's
going to be more effective for us to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, start the plants on a shorter
day or do a step down or maybe instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: taking them out at 15 nine, maybe we take
them out at, at, at 17 seven and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, ah, two hours isn't going to
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so like where, where in that variable
process are the ones that you think we're
[SPEAKER_01]: most likely to find success, you know,
jiggering with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I really do think that,
uh, as I mentioned before, some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: species may be a little bit more sensitive
than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, so how you, um, you know,
I, there's not one answer that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: cover all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really what I would say is to try to
match.
[SPEAKER_02]: So start with a shorter photo period
indoors is the way that I would absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause as you step it down, as you said,
you know, those little steps might
[SPEAKER_02]: initiate a flowering event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's not the outcome that you
want, um, then you've just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of ruined your whole crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so what I would do is I would,
um, absolutely keep the photo period as
[SPEAKER_02]: closely matched to that, the time that you
expect to go outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're suggesting maybe just kind of
like, get off the myth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's normally for, you know,
traditional prohibition era indoor growers
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're like, Oh, 24, 18,
six, 12, 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause because, you know, when you're,
when you're running lights, you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're God, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do anything you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if, if the plan is to go outside,
maybe just pop, pop your seeds or make
[SPEAKER_01]: your clones at 16 hour days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though you're running your lights
a little less long, um, you will make up
[SPEAKER_01]: for that in having clear headed knowledge
that when you go outside, your plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that would be my, that would be my
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality is, you know, the energy
expenditure is pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that, you know, you know,
I'll speak only on led lighting,
[SPEAKER_02]: led lighting could, could hit those light
levels, um, cause you still want to hit
[SPEAKER_02]: the DLIs that your daily average,
um, light intensity, um, the integral of
[SPEAKER_02]: the light over the photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to, in order to go to that,
that 16 eight, um, you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: use higher light levels in order to still
get the growth that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, meaning intensity of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, so most of these, you know,
with, with some of the old, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hyper sodium metal halides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you, you get what you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, there's no ideas of dimmers or
any ways to, to reduce lights or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, do anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with LEDs, you have infinite dim
ability capabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of these things are pushing out,
you know, 17, 50 micro moles, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: per second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, you know, these things are
getting really impressive in light output.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could, you can crank up the light
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your energy expenditure is going to be
pretty much the same, uh, because you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, you're using the same amount of
energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over a shorter period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this plays in right into a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was probably the question I was most
excited about asking you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's about the 24 hour light cycle
and it's, it's always interesting to watch
[SPEAKER_01]: folks who are, who are growing outdoors
versus indoors and how we were taught by
[SPEAKER_01]: our mentors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then nowadays when, when indoors and
outdoors and people are going back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth because it's, it's generally safer
to grow in both, in both environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's kind of a clash of,
of myth and what people were learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the most watched videos on the
shaping fire YouTube channel is an
[SPEAKER_01]: interview I did just a quick one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did with Dr. Karuna Chowre explaining
that the 24 hour light cycle is not
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial for plants because without a
dark period, microbes in the soil will
[SPEAKER_01]: starve because it's during this dark
period that the plants feed the microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: in the rhizosphere with their exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they push them down through
the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the first time I really
considered the give and take between the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for so many people they run,
especially in hydro, they'll just run
[SPEAKER_01]: their plants 24 hours, um, to have the
plants grow faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for many people, they actually can
sneak another cycle in their year because
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants grow about 20% faster with a 24
hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no break.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Dr. Chowre was very clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you are growing plants
faster, but you are growing plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: are weaker because you don't have strong
microbes and this back and forth before
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants don't work as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, my, my talk with her was
only about eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so does this sound like this makes
sense to you that the plants need this
[SPEAKER_01]: dark period?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and if so, what do you see happening
to benefit the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: During the dark that is so essential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I am a light nerd, but I'm also a
circadian nerd, uh, which means that there
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to be a 24 hour cycle and plants
respond to a 24 hour cycle, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means that it has to be both light
and dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, cell respiration occurs in
darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of beneficial things occur during
darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I think that there's a lot of
things that we probably don't know I,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm, I'm not a plant
physiologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a, you know, a lighting, uh,
scientist, but, um, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the idea of having a light and dark
period is going to drive the circadian of
[SPEAKER_02]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, so I think wholeheartedly that we
need to really respect that, that dark
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's two hours, uh, at a minimum,
I would like to at least see the idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 zero going to at least 22 two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and again, as I kind of mentioned
before, there's infinite expandability
[SPEAKER_02]: with, with the newer led lighting
technologies that, um, that could allow
[SPEAKER_02]: for the same kind of grow rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause you could just have higher light
outputs and still have some sort of a dark
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think the idea of the, um,
uh, you know, microbial, um, interactions
[SPEAKER_02]: is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I think that there is going to be
a lot more going on in that plant that's
[SPEAKER_02]: dictated by that light dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that is really, you know, it always
comes back to what, what nature is doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's not too many environments that
are 24 zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, so plants have evolved around
a, an environment that's both light and
[SPEAKER_02]: dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the better we could do with that,
the better off your plant is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: as a result.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, um, my Testament would be
that, that you should strive to do that as
[SPEAKER_02]: much as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually even expands what I,
what I feel like I want to continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: look into, which is not, you're saying
that, yeah, this is probably all true with
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also there are unique botanical,
I don't know, housekeeping that happens
[SPEAKER_01]: during the dark period.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the plant needs itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a, like a, you know,
just a photosynthesis machine and you just
[SPEAKER_01]: turn it on and it runs infinitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It too needs to take out the garbage and
do self, uh, you know, transpiration and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and these other things that it does during
the dark period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's, um, there's some species
of plant that will, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: co-evolve with its predators and will
change its, um, nutritional content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the course of the day, it's so that
it, you know, quote unquote tastes yuckier
[SPEAKER_02]: to, um, plants are too, um, uh,
and then, um, there are plants that will
[SPEAKER_02]: co-evolve with their, their pollinators so
that they'll, you know, admit some odors
[SPEAKER_02]: to, to kind of attract pollinators at a
very specific time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's all these things that
happen over the course of the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: biologically speaking, and without a dark
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that plant's going to have no
reference for when the day starts and when
[SPEAKER_02]: the day ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I think that we're probably going
to find out that there's some interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: things that, that are happening as a
result.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that historically though,
that, you know, it's always been one
[SPEAKER_02]: parameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get longer hours, you get more
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you get better growth, but if you were
to compress that same amount of light from
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 hours into, you know, a shorter photo
period and just increase the intensity of
[SPEAKER_02]: the lights, um, I think you're going to
get a better response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so let's move on to a different line
of thought, but still talking about light
[SPEAKER_01]: and dark period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so indoor cultivators are very careful
not to let light hit their plants during
[SPEAKER_01]: the dark period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some, that means simply not
entering the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: For others, it means duct taping any holes
in their indoor tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for outdoor folks, it means not
turning on the floodlights off the back of
[SPEAKER_01]: the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: At night.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do we know how much light leakage
will actually impact a crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the threshold of where the
interruption will cause, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants biological confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's a, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, um, you know, I don't,
I don't know that there's a real
[SPEAKER_02]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I gather that it's actually not that,
not that low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's not like, uh, you know,
the, you know, a small incandescent light,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to really do a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the, the likely light leakage,
um, if it's minimal coming through the
[SPEAKER_02]: cracks is going to be that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that, you know,
general practice to make the night
[SPEAKER_02]: environment as dark as possible is a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't think that there'll be
biological confusion, but it may,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, halt cell respiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may help halt some of the nighttime
activities, um, which are, are going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: vital to, um, to the success of that crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we were to think about which would
be worse, like, you know, um, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the intensity of the interruption of dark
or the length of the interruption of dark,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I want to know if you have anything to
say about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in comparison, say walking into your,
like, let's say, you know, your sister in
[SPEAKER_01]: law is in town and she walks into your
grow room and turns on the light and
[SPEAKER_01]: during the dark period and suddenly now
there's, you know, there's all these,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, bulbs that are on and she's like,
oh, I'm not, this is not the room I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be on in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she turns off the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was short, maybe 10, 12 seconds,
but it was a whole bunch of, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, shop lights that may have
come on versus say a tent that's got a
[SPEAKER_01]: handful of like pin prick holes in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got this tiny, tiny amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's in your living room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's constant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, um, are they both potentially
troublesome or really does, because
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps some hormone or something needs to
build up in the plant, the short burst
[SPEAKER_01]: really isn't going to do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more what happens over the longer
term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it, you know, it's both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the, uh, so the plant will
acclimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the dark period is, you know,
that constant, day, you know, that
[SPEAKER_02]: constant like threshold, low threshold day
in, day out, um, it's going to acclimate
[SPEAKER_02]: to that as being kind of the standard for
what nighttime is, um, as opposed to the
[SPEAKER_02]: bright light may, um, may alter it for
that one night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, maybe it will, it'll
actually shift the clock, um, to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to maybe like a quote unquote different
time zone for the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after about two or three days,
it's going to come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, right back to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that single event is probably in,
in both cases, neither one's really that
[SPEAKER_02]: bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's really just kind of, if you,
you know, if you do something where you
[SPEAKER_02]: got a lot of light for a long period of
time, is it, is it going to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: detrimental impact?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's probably not a very
satisfactory answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I, if I have to pick one,
I think that the, the short burst of lots
[SPEAKER_02]: of light for one period of time is going
to have a longer lasting impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then kind of the, the like really dim
light constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually getting to that, you said
something I found very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that, um, if you've got a small
dribble of light coming into your growing
[SPEAKER_01]: area, whether it be indoor or outdoor,
that so long as it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a low amount that that could become,
if you will, the new normal, it reminds me
[SPEAKER_01]: of, of what, you know, shooting
photography and you set the white balance
[SPEAKER_01]: on a camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, Hey, this is what light is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, camera.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you do have a tent in your
living room and you're a patient and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you know, you're just doing what
you can to grow your medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have an imperfect tent,
if you've got a low level of light that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes in there regularly, your plants are
just going to go, okay, this is what
[SPEAKER_01]: night's going to be for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do our night stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it gets to this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll acclimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super interesting, Robert.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure that that that doesn't
mean like, Oh, you could just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: crank on the, the ambient lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you're doing the standard
practices to make that, that environment
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's, that's kind of what you,
what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't give you freedom to,
to just keep the lights on, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: around your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you definitely want to try to make it
as dark as you possibly can, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: but given that, um, it'll absolutely know
what the threshold is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll acclimate to, to that, um,
that low light level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard anybody say anything
about the light cycle and how it may
[SPEAKER_01]: impact plants during a full moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I understand a little bit about
the, the biodynamic stuff from,
[SPEAKER_01]: from those folks about, you know,
full moons, but, um, as far as they're
[SPEAKER_01]: being, you know, air quotes, all of this
light during a bright night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is that re I mean, we experience it,
you know, as human animals, as a bright
[SPEAKER_01]: night and cause we can see, and that makes
us feel safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Safer, but does a bright moon night really
impact the plants at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's way below threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, that's like 0.001 lux on a
full moon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, there is really what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even you go outside and you see
street lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there is evidence of, you know,
trees that are right next to that street
[SPEAKER_02]: light will have a significant impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the ones that are, you know,
kind of some distance away, those light
[SPEAKER_02]: levels, just kind of think about that
light level.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not impacting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's below the threshold of what,
of what that plant is seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, back to the original point,
when it sees that every single day,
[SPEAKER_02]: it acclimates and goes, all right,
yeah, this is, this is my nighttime
[SPEAKER_02]: scheme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I follow this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one more question before we go to our
first commercial break, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, some indoor growers use a green
headlamp to work during the dark periods
[SPEAKER_01]: and other growers are all like,
no, that's totally bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That like, if you, even if you use green
lamp, it is interrupting the dark period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so you're the scientist is using a
green headlight lamp, legitimate tech,
[SPEAKER_01]: or is that a myth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so what a green headlamp will do is
if you're trying to assess the plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: see how they're doing, they're going to
reflect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, green better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you could get a sense of what's
going on with a lot less light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it has to be a really, really dim
green light.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a super bright green light,
then, you know, you're, you're absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: getting, giving them that bright burst of
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at a time that could actually,
um, throw off their, um, their circadian
[SPEAKER_02]: rhythms and their, their night phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that it is a good idea as long
as you're not blasting those headlights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the re the main reason is because
you're, you're using the spectral
[SPEAKER_02]: reflectance of that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the fact that it's reflecting a lot of
that green light, um, it's using a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but it's reflecting the most of it
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll, if what you're trying to do is
see the plant, you know, assess an issue
[SPEAKER_02]: and then go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you want to use as little of it as you
possibly can to make sure you could do
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, um, do it good enough and then go
about, you know, go about your other
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's not a fail safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to not interrupt that
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it absolutely can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but the green light helps you see that
plant a little bit better using the least
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of light you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me see if I can break that down to
two rules of thumb for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would it be correct if I were to say,
um, if you're going to use any light,
[SPEAKER_01]: green is a good choice, but you want to
use as small amount of it as, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can and only use it in a small area,
like with a headlamp in contrast to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even seen people using green flood
lamps in their grow at night so that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can, you know, clean and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas that, that's a terrible idea
because the intensity is more and longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green is not a magical color spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't interrupt sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much for that,
Robert.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go ahead and take our first
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is lighting scientist,
Robert Soler.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of good seed makers out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every once in a while, someone becomes
legendary.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mendocino California cannabis breeder
called Mandelbrot is one of these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mandelbrot was also known as Ross truth
and his cultivars are known as the
[SPEAKER_01]: foundation for the Emerald triangles.
[SPEAKER_01]: World famous gasoline scented terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day when it was really hard to
find quality genetics and education,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mandelbrot was advocating for organic
growing techniques and providing
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptional seeds that would sell out as
soon as they hit the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mandelbrot lived too short a life dying in
2015, but while he was with us,
[SPEAKER_01]: he created several connoisseur level
canvas masterpieces like oil spill,
[SPEAKER_01]: the truth and Royal Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter if you approach growing cannabis
more as a toker or a breeder, you will
[SPEAKER_01]: find something that delights you in
Mandelbrot selections because while some
[SPEAKER_01]: strains are better to grow or to smoke,
Mandelbrot's creation is excellent in
[SPEAKER_01]: every category.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why people keep talking about
them even today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald mountain legacy continues the Ross
truth tradition by preserving these
[SPEAKER_01]: coveted genetics for future generations
unchanged as they were originally created
[SPEAKER_01]: in the mid 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald mountain legacy also creates
tasteful modern crosses to Mandelbrot's
[SPEAKER_01]: classics.
[SPEAKER_01]: These lines worked by Mandelbrot's brother
Ben furthers their family's genetics and a
[SPEAKER_01]: spirit that Mandelbrot himself would
approve of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the Emerald mountain legacy
Instagram and website to see photos of
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants and learn more about
Mandelbrot and his infamous strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald mountain legacy seeds are
available online from seed banks and
[SPEAKER_01]: distributors, including labyrinth seed
company, the regenerative seed company and
[SPEAKER_01]: pure sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald mountain legacy, keeping
Mandelbrot's legacy alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-rolls have come a long way since the
early days of normalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you choose Saint's joints,
you are smoking all flower top shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-rolls with terpenes that will sculpt
your high in a way that dry old pre-rolls
[SPEAKER_01]: just can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas most brands release pre-rolls as
an afterthought, for the last five years,
[SPEAKER_01]: Saint's joints has focused on their line
of exotic curated joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while some companies just chase the
hype strains, Saint's joints goes deeper,
[SPEAKER_01]: searching out hard to find strains,
unexpected crosses and nearly forgotten
[SPEAKER_01]: land races and classics and some hype ones
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only does a joint from Saint's smoke
incredibly well, they have fine tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: every step of the process so you don't get
runs in the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The joint is just the right density to
have a nice pull and the joint stays lit,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if you get a bit chatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saint's joints boxes are works of art and
will spark conversation when you pull them
[SPEAKER_01]: out at a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saint's award-winning boxes change with
every release, feature edgy outsider art
[SPEAKER_01]: and often raise awareness of important
issues like equal rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saint's boxes are so desired that many
collect them and display them in their
[SPEAKER_01]: homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask your budtender for Saint's joints and
have a premium joint experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you are a licensed cannabis
cultivator, I have an extra message for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saint's is looking for partners in legal
cannabis states to expand the availability
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Saint's joints brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow exceptional cannabis flower
but are less excited about all the effort,
[SPEAKER_01]: cost and risk of launching your own brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Saint's joints may be just the partner you
are looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already established in California,
Washington and Oklahoma and recognized by
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneur magazine and green
entrepreneur as a cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: leader, the Saint's joints brand will set
you apart in your home market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing I can recommend is for you
to visit their Instagram at Saint's joints
[SPEAKER_01]: and look at their patented drawer design
boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Become that brand everyone is talking
about without having to build it from
[SPEAKER_01]: scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the Instagram at Saint's joints
and then visit saintsjoints.com to find
[SPEAKER_01]: out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to Shaping Fire and you grow
your own cannabis, chances are high that
[SPEAKER_01]: you are very particular about the inputs
you use for growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like us painstakingly self-educate
on cannabis nutrients and techniques so we
[SPEAKER_01]: can cultivate the best tasting and
cleanest flowers possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we go to purchase those
nutrients, we want to be sure that our
[SPEAKER_01]: supplier shares our values and is
providing exceptional quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I recommend buildasoil.com to
my friends who care about quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buildasoil empowers organic growers to do
their best work by sourcing and shipping
[SPEAKER_01]: only the finest cannabis growing supplies.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is lighting
scientist, Robert Solerre.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Robert, you know, during an interview
with soil educator, Jeff Lowenfels,
[SPEAKER_01]: he suggested that sunlight has a very
powerful effect on the soil microbes and
[SPEAKER_01]: soil life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, it isn't just the plants that's
taking up the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the soil and you know,
everything that's living in it that is
[SPEAKER_01]: also taking in the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he continued to say that this is one
of the reasons why indoor cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: pales when compared to outdoor generally,
because the sun is so much more intense
[SPEAKER_01]: that it has, I don't know, a deeper reach
into the soil, I guess I'll say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, what is it in sunshine that
provides, you know, life to the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: how difficult is that to attain nowadays
with lights indoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I would think any of those
benefits, you know, could come from the
[SPEAKER_02]: penetration.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would probably stand to guess that
it has a lot more to do with the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, indoor lighting has the
opportunity, you know, to do whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for energy efficiency, it's always
putting all the energy, at least the
[SPEAKER_02]: energy efficient ones, LED specifically,
will put all the energy in the PAR region
[SPEAKER_02]: from 400 to 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the sun puts out stuff,
you know, from 300 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, on up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there's stuff in the UV, there's stuff
in the infrared spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interaction of those things with
sunlight and daylight is probably pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: profound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I would probably stand to guess that
it has more to do with the idea of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it could be a circadian
component of temperature, but probably
[SPEAKER_02]: also, you know, the far reds and the
ultraviolets that come from that solar
[SPEAKER_02]: exposure that's going to have the impact
on microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would probably say that that doesn't
mean that interior lighting is inferior.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just means that we got to get smarter
about how we do interior lighting because
[SPEAKER_02]: we could absolutely recreate any of those
spectrums.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could create far reds, we could create
UVA, UVB.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it really just comes around to playing
around and really getting into the
[SPEAKER_02]: research of what we could do to kind of
find out what those benefits are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's taken me a long time
to come around this idea that it really
[SPEAKER_01]: depends on what you want for your output.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's crappy outdoor and there's
crappy indoor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had good indoor and I've had good
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, it's what you're actually
looking to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can find a combination of,
you know, an appropriately efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor light that can sustain the proper,
you know, microbe life and also give the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant what it needs, you may not need the
entirety of the sunshine spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no doubt that when you're
outside that, you know, there's all the
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum you need and more for your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some kind of combination
between, you know, the knowledge of which
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the spectrum helps sustain
microbe life in the rhizosphere and along
[SPEAKER_01]: the top layers that the light can
penetrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, I guess just bang for
your buck, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if the goal is to produce a,
you know, a good tasting, good looking
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that thrives and resists pests,
we may be able to do that without the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire spectrum of the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you hit on a good point there is that,
you know, as someone who, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: makes lights, you know, you could make a
light with all these things, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to cost you a lot more to have that
capability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you're going to give up
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, if you wanted UV light for your
soil, you know, get like a supplement or a
[SPEAKER_02]: fluorescent tube and put it on the soil
and test it out and see what you get out
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there are things you could do
kind of add on features that you could
[SPEAKER_02]: throw on to test stuff out and really kind
of see what is going to work for your
[SPEAKER_02]: individual grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's probably the most important
thing is to, for us to all kind of be
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists with what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate you saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this show is very in favor of
citizen scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny because sometimes I'll
have, you know, either guests on the show
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or scientists I'll meet at conventions
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they really don't like the,
you know, the regular folk messing,
[SPEAKER_01]: messing with the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, ah, you just,
you know, just read the white papers and
[SPEAKER_01]: do what we say, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But especially when it comes to cannabis,
when for so long, all of us growers were
[SPEAKER_01]: on our own because, you know, good
educated folks like you were, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: were not available to us, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I appreciate the fact that,
you know, you encourage us to experiment
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking of experimenting,
you know, I was in preparation for this
[SPEAKER_01]: interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and I watched all your prior
interviews that I could find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during one of your interviews,
you mentioned that you have some secret
[SPEAKER_01]: sauce on using light to improve cloning
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that interview, the interview
is blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They blew right over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, oh, that's totally what I
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part of it I wanted to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so will you share that with us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how can we better our cloning
success with something about lights?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that it's, I think that most
people kind of have an idea of what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really kind of meeting the blue light
thresholds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people will talk about,
you know, they'll just use metal halide or
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll use cool white fluorescent to do
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really it's a matter of making sure
that you meet the blue light threshold
[SPEAKER_02]: because if you don't, we talked about this
early on, if you don't have enough blue
[SPEAKER_02]: light, the plants will basically feel like
they're, they're starved, they're in shade
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they'll elongate trying to get more
blue light until they meet the threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so it's really important to get a
light that has that blue light that meets
[SPEAKER_02]: that blue light threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually about kind of rule of thumb
is about 30 micromoles per meter squared
[SPEAKER_02]: of blue light is what's required.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're trying to put out,
you know, 300 or 400 micromoles per meter
[SPEAKER_02]: squared, that means you're going to
probably want about eight to 10% of blue
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is kind of where a lot of this
stuff, if you had a high pressure sodium,
[SPEAKER_02]: high pressure sodium only puts out about
5% blue light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of where some of the,
the ideas have stemmed from, but if you,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you figure out that threshold,
which is generally about 30 micromoles of
[SPEAKER_02]: blue light, now you could really kind of
maximize that spectrum for efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once you maximize the efficiency,
then you're going to get tremendous yields
[SPEAKER_02]: because you could, you could really kind
of create something that has that spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting the threshold, but, but putting
all the energy in the high efficiency
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthetically active region.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would not be able to do this with
either the traditional lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, HPS or metal halide,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need some sort of LED to
do this nowadays, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there are manufacturers that'll
talk about, you know, they've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: special high pressure sodium or something
that has more, you know, more optimized
[SPEAKER_02]: for growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is the spectral power
distribution of these things, the way that
[SPEAKER_02]: they put energy is pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's HPS versus a different HPS,
metal halide versus different metal
[SPEAKER_02]: halide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really only LED that has this almost
infinite, well, I would say it is
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely infinite modularity of,
and configuration of what spectrum you
[SPEAKER_02]: could possibly have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a cloning area, you could have
exactly the right spectrum that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a vegetation area, exactly what you
need, the right spectrum that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: For flowering, just the right spectrum
that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all really kind of stems from a
very specific blue light threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all kind of the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason why HPS works out well in a
flowering room is because the light levels
[SPEAKER_02]: are so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're giving, you know, 600 plus
micromoles per meter squared, if 5% is
[SPEAKER_02]: blue, you're still hitting that threshold
of 30 micromoles of blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why it still works there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to use lower light levels than
that, then you actually start seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: morphological effects and not good ones,
bad ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start getting lanky or leggy,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that I'm about to suggest a
really janky hack, but I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm probably going to ask you,
you know, I've seen people have HPS lights
[SPEAKER_01]: and they read something that they needed
to increase their blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they took those, you know,
like the blue lighting gels from like a
[SPEAKER_01]: stagecraft, like going to see a band or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will put one of those,
you know, over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, look, I just covered up
20% of my light with blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got a bunch more blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that science?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't get 30 micromoles of blue
without the filter, the filter just
[SPEAKER_02]: subtracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't add anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's the opposite direction even.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's shifted or it removes a lot
of the red component out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but your light levels have just dropped
significantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to find someone where that
actually worked, but that's not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know how it is with bro science,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's kind of the other side of the
coin, just being a citizen scientist,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, trying a bunch of
stuff is great, but then also,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of the stuff that had been
handed down from our mentors doesn't pan
[SPEAKER_01]: out long-term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know a lot of your work with light
involves humans and it was actually really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting to listen to your interviews
about, you know, human lightings and
[SPEAKER_01]: circadian rhythms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also then to hear you talk about
the same thing in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, cultivation employees spend
a lot of time under a wide range of lights
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you know, from classic HPS and metal
halide to LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, now even some folks are
spending for the plasma lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what impact does working under these
sorts of artificial lights have on the
[SPEAKER_01]: humans that work below them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm assuming that we can't just group
them all in one category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like go category by category,
if you will, because lots of cultivators
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they'd be curious to know what
the lights they work under may be doing to
[SPEAKER_01]: their human.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would say that generally speaking
from a human circadian standpoint,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that most people aren't very well
educated on this, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of talk about blue light and
its effect on our sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically there is a newly discovered
photoreceptor that drives our circadian
[SPEAKER_02]: rhythms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really what the problem is,
is not so much these grow environments,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the regular dim lit office
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really kind of need to have brighter
days and darker nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the built environment, if you're in
a grow space and you're getting,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what, call it, you know,
six, 700 micromoles per meter squared,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a ton of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to be convinced the fact
that that is a ton of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are working a day shift in those
spaces and you're getting a ton of that
[SPEAKER_02]: light, that is a fantastic way to get the
dose that you need of light for your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're on a shift work schedule
where you're going in after hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: that light could absolutely destroy your
sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's a time that you're supposed to
not be getting, you know, just like what
[SPEAKER_02]: we talked about before, plants could get
altered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their growth could get altered.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could completely throw off your
circadian rhythms, making it really hard
[SPEAKER_02]: to to sleep that night, but also the next
three or four nights afterwards as a
[SPEAKER_02]: result of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like that will be enough
light to shift you to another time zone up
[SPEAKER_02]: to three hours later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something that could
dramatically impact your sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're getting that light exposure,
what I would actually recommend,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is pretty simple, if you're doing it
after hours, there are blue blocking
[SPEAKER_02]: glasses that exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy them anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, we got some friends at True
Dark that make some really good ones that
[SPEAKER_02]: block out all the blue light.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a really good approach to
protecting yourself from getting too much
[SPEAKER_02]: of that daytime exposure at a time that
you don't want to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me unpack that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you're saying that if you're
under all that light during your regular
[SPEAKER_01]: daytime, let's say nine to five,
shift, you're actually winning because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting a ton of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will not need a seasonal effectiveness
disorder light box.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting all that at work and you're
getting it at the right time in
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship to your sleep cycles so that
when you go to sleep, you'll be good to go
[SPEAKER_01]: to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if your second shift in the afternoon
and you're still hoping to sleep at night,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're kind of jacked because it's going
to shift you off by three hours and
[SPEAKER_01]: disturb your night.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's say you're working the night
shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work the night shift and you're
sleeping during the daytime so your whole
[SPEAKER_01]: life is upside down, will you be in good
shape again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, while you might be on an
artificial sleep cycle that's not in jive
[SPEAKER_01]: with the planet, you're actually resetting
your own circadian rhythm to night shift
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'd actually be OK again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the quandary that has plagued pretty
much all shift work in all industries,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is, you know, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could totally do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, you'll absolutely shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the problem is what happens when you
live your normal life on your off days and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now maybe you're aligned with that
night shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you go out and normal life has a
regular sun that goes at a different time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now the sun is the thing that
completely throws off your schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it could be the exact same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wear those glasses when you go out in
the sun to try to minimize the disruption
[SPEAKER_02]: that the solar cycle is going to have on
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, from a health and wellness
standpoint, what you want to do is try to
[SPEAKER_02]: create that same pattern, same wake up and
sleep times over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, for some people,
that means you're kind of looking like a
[SPEAKER_02]: vampire on your off days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the protection mechanism in all
scenarios is to have some sort of blue
[SPEAKER_02]: blocking glasses to try to make it so that
light exposure at the wrong time doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: throw your sleep cycles off kilter.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're talking about glasses and the
eyes, I don't spend a ton of time under
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know when I go and I get tours and
stuff and the tour goes especially long
[SPEAKER_01]: that when I leave, sometimes my eyes feel
tired, like they've been worked too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious what being under intense
light like that as a full time job might
[SPEAKER_01]: degrade the eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these spectrums that we're growing
under potentially dangerous for the eyes
[SPEAKER_01]: or is it just that I'm not used to that
intensity?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I go in it for a little while,
it tires my eyes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that the bigger thing is it's
not the intensity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really kind of more of the gradient
or the contrast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a lot of bright and dark and your
eyes are constantly trying to adjust to
[SPEAKER_02]: those.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about being outside,
you're usually either shaded or you're in
[SPEAKER_02]: this ubiquitously bright space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nothing about the intensity and
it's nothing really about the spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: that's particularly harmful.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's causing this fatigue is that your
eyes are constantly going from a bright
[SPEAKER_02]: spot to a dark spot and it's trying to
acclimate to these multiple locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a little bit of, you know,
your eyes aren't acclimated to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know from the visual science
standpoint that high contrast ratios like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's just like when you watch
it, when you're watching TV at night and
[SPEAKER_02]: all the lights are off, it could be kind
of glaring and off putting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you just put a little bit of ambient
light on and it makes that screen a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more comfortable to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it has to do with the contrast
ratios of light and dark that you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I understand that right,
what you're suggesting is that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the, like my pupils are tired,
that muscle or whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: that mechanism in my eyes, it's opening
and closing so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's closing when I'm directly under
the light, but then it's opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I go away from the light for a
minute to take something off of a shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: and bring it back to the light,
now it's back under.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's exactly that back and forth that's
making my eyes tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a lot more fatigue on the
cones itself because it's called lateral
[SPEAKER_02]: inhibition, which is the contrast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It amplifies a signal when it's contrasted
against darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're really giving your cones in your
eye a roller coaster of emotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a combination of that and the
pupil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your irises are kind of going back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about the true dark glasses
for people to help with their circadian
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of a recommendation do you have
for people who work under lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have this experience of going
back and forth from the bright environment
[SPEAKER_01]: to the darker environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so their pupils are potentially
getting tired at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a hack for them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it should be just glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the same kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we trying to cut out the blue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it a different kind of glasses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the Method 7s or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if I know the Method 7s.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do those do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so they're just often used for folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only to darken the eyes,
but from what I understand about the
[SPEAKER_01]: technology, it's taking out particular
spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: The time that I experience it most is when
I'm trying to take photography in a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and I get those black bars on the
photographs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while I've not used the Method 7
glasses, I actually do use the Method 7
[SPEAKER_01]: lens on my camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like we may have waded into
an area that we're less familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that what's interesting,
those black bars, it's the DC ripple on
[SPEAKER_02]: your electrical current that interferes
with the camera exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, I've seen on iPhones,
and all you have to do is change the
[SPEAKER_02]: aperture exposure and it'll wipe out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think iPhones really fixed that in
software recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's actually a really interesting
phenomenon on ripple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the current in your lighting system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing wrong with anything that's
going on, but it's just a conflict between
[SPEAKER_02]: the two electrical devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say, back to the main
question, is what you do to try to,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're going on that back and forth,
is really just try to have overall
[SPEAKER_02]: intensity glasses if you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think trying to filter out any
spectrum, so that blue light is what
[SPEAKER_02]: drives your what's called a sustained
pupil constriction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you probably don't want to have a blue
blocking glass because while that keeps
[SPEAKER_02]: your eye open, it's also letting a lot of
that light come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really just want to lower the light
level so what you're seeing in your office
[SPEAKER_02]: and what you're seeing in the grow space
are close to the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most standard off-the-shelf glasses
will cut 90% of the light level,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's probably what you want to do
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it certainly would increase
the price of the operation just for the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific basis, would it then also make
sense to, let's say that you're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouse and you've got some part of it
that is the artificial lighting for grows,
[SPEAKER_01]: would it also make sense to pick up the
ambient lighting of the entire space so
[SPEAKER_01]: there's less contrast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like your example of watching
television in the dark is not the greatest
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps the whole warehouse shouldn't be
black except for the grow area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great idea as well to try to
minimize those contrast ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is a non-grow example but in
buildings, at least well-designed ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have windows, they'll put light on
the walls in between those windows to try
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that that wall in between the
bright windows is as bright as it can be
[SPEAKER_02]: to minimize that contrast ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you it's only a matter of time
before we start to see OSHA regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: around how bright the ambient environment
in cultivation warehouses have got to be
[SPEAKER_01]: just for the health of the employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would say because we also do
some work with the Department of Energy
[SPEAKER_02]: that they would probably suggest that the
glasses is probably the better solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than wasting all the extra electricity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's go ahead and take our second
short break.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is lighting scientist Robert
[SPEAKER_01]: Soler.
[SPEAKER_01]: In times like these, when so many cannabis
companies lovingly cultivated flowers is
[SPEAKER_01]: just silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moontime Medicinals is located in Humboldt
County on the lush south fork of the Eel
[SPEAKER_01]: River watershed in the epicenter of the
American cannabis heartland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moontime Medicinals grows under bright
California sun in greenhouses using only
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming techniques like
hugelkultur, compost teas, whole food
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers, and fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every part of their growing process plays
its own part in nature and nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic is injected into the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The result is big, beautiful cannabis
flowers with wide ranging terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: that taste like great cannabis should.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in California, ask your
budtender for Moontime Medicinals and
[SPEAKER_01]: visit Moontime Medicinals on the web and
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moontime Medicinals is also available as
part of the Redwood Roots family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moontime's whole flowers appear in Redwood
Roots curated joint packs alongside other
[SPEAKER_01]: heritage cannabis cultivators like Lady
Sativa Farm, Ridgeline Farms, Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: Redwood Healing, and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moontime Medicinals, top shelf cannabis
grown in harmony with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons why no till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trouble with growing in new soils or
blended cocoa substrates is that it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the plant's life just to create
these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's three times the concentration of
the current leading brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This new product called Dynomyco is the
result of 30 years of research and trials
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Volcani Agriculture Research
Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: since the product first arrived here last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have already even heard about
Dynomyco by its original name,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Dynomyco is available at grow shops
and online in the United States for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of mycelium networks in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also as a biostimulant to make clone
cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco at
[SPEAKER_01]: dynomyco.com and find out where you can
get yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_01]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing cannabis in greenhouses is taking
over the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: An efficient and effective blend of
sunshine-grown terpene profiles and the
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled environment of indoor,
greenhouses can be the best of both
[SPEAKER_01]: worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: For many greenhouse operators,
though, building their greenhouse before
[SPEAKER_01]: gaining insight into how cannabis
greenhouses differ from ornamental crops
[SPEAKER_01]: can be the start of a world of hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric Branstad and his team at Greenhouse
Advisory Group have the experience and
[SPEAKER_01]: technical know-how to help you avoid these
pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric Branstad has been helping cannabis
growers find locations, design,
[SPEAKER_01]: build, and equip their greenhouses for
over a decade, first starting in Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California, but expanding over the last
five years to helping clients throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has an impeccable reputation for both
depth of knowledge and kindness and
[SPEAKER_01]: communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear Eric explain some of the
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_01]: how to overcome them in episode number 41
of the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter where I go in the country,
good people with smart backgrounds still
[SPEAKER_01]: are making the mistake of building without
knowing cannabis, and it causes them to
[SPEAKER_01]: burn through capital and time fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone has their own failure point.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some, it is improper ventilation
planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: For others, it is surface temperatures of
the building or the plant's leaves or
[SPEAKER_01]: both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some folks that build their greenhouse
from scratch make really basic errors like
[SPEAKER_01]: placement of the greenhouse on the
property or not understanding the natural
[SPEAKER_01]: environment where the greenhouse sits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some have even built a decent greenhouse,
but are inefficient in their deployment of
[SPEAKER_01]: light deprivation techniques and never
really hit their target yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great when you learn from your
mistakes, but it's even better when you
[SPEAKER_01]: learn from the mistakes of others.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you bring on Greenhouse Advisory
Group, you will learn from the mistakes of
[SPEAKER_01]: their many clients, and you'll take
advantage of the best practices developed
[SPEAKER_01]: by Eric Branstad over his years of working
with clients just like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: From location development to choosing a
builder and tricking out your new
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse or retrofitting or rescuing
your failing greenhouse, Eric will help
[SPEAKER_01]: you through it.

more and connect with Eric and his team.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Greenhouse Advisory Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is lighting scientist,
[SPEAKER_01]: Robert Soler.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Robert, one of the things that I've
heard you say a couple of times in your
[SPEAKER_01]: other interviews is that people and plants
see light differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems like the kind of phrase
that you kind of throw out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that there's a whole hell of a lot
behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just want to go on a little
fishing expedition with this phrase that
[SPEAKER_01]: you use often.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean by plants and humans
seeing the light differently?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I mean, so I guess anyone who's
familiar with early day LED light will
[SPEAKER_02]: show, you know, it's a purple light,
right, or pink light, and it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: comprised of blue and red.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's because plants, which are
green, reflect green, see blue and red
[SPEAKER_02]: most efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people actually see green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on a high level, so there are things
that are what people see, which are kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of lux or lumens.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we see light.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we quantify how bright
something is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, plants, which use PPFD, see things
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that it's even more
complicated than that, because when we
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about, say, comparing different light
fixtures, like a high-pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_02]: light fixture, or a metal halide,
or an LED, the way that those spectral
[SPEAKER_02]: compositions are, we'll see them maybe
like, we could have a metal halide that
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like, we'll call it a 5,000 Kelvin
color, which is very cool white light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could get an LED that matches it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they could look the same to us,
but the plants actually will look at those
[SPEAKER_02]: lights, and they're very, very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's all about the spectral power
distribution of how that all works out
[SPEAKER_02]: that is really what you want to think
about when you're deciding what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: LED light or whatever kind of lighting
technology you have that's going to work
[SPEAKER_02]: best for your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you look at high-pressure sodium,
that doesn't mean you need an LED
[SPEAKER_02]: replacement that looks the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means you might get better
performance out of something that doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: look the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same goes true with the metal halide,
is that what the plant sees and what we
[SPEAKER_02]: see are fundamentally different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can't look at a light and say,
oh, that's going to perform really well or
[SPEAKER_02]: really poorly just because of what my eye
sees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is really true as we start
getting into the infinite possibilities
[SPEAKER_02]: that LED light provides for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can't use our eyes to judge the
spectrum, and while that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual sense to me, I've been in
plenty of grow rooms where the cultivator
[SPEAKER_01]: has told me that they're, for example,
bulbs get tired over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll tell me, oh, the bulb's
getting tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell because the spectrum is
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I certainly defer to their
experience and it's their grow room,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that enough of a subtlety in chief
change of an old bulb changing spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: that they will actually be able to see
with this technology we have that are
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes?
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the older technology, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: A metal halide will change its color once
it gets, quote unquote, tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a visible change.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a spectrum we can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a visible change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those changes will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a new metal halide versus an old metal
halide will get a little bit of a shift,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's not nearly as significant as
what it's going to have versus an LED
[SPEAKER_02]: light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what it comes down to is really
kind of understanding the buckets of light
[SPEAKER_02]: that they have, how much percentage of
blue light you have, how much percentage
[SPEAKER_02]: of red light you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're thinking about it,
you got to think about it in those terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all comes back to kind of hitting
this threshold of, you know, a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: number of blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is really kind of what drives
most of the morphological effects is I
[SPEAKER_02]: need, you know, again, rule of thumb about
30 micro moles as my minimum of blue
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I measure light and when I think
about how much light I'm going to put out
[SPEAKER_02]: there, you know, if I have 20% blue light,
you know, that's probably going to do good
[SPEAKER_02]: enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have 5% blue light, that's probably
going to be pushing the boundaries of what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, as I mentioned before,
hypersodium has low amounts of blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal halide has, you know, higher amounts
of blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fluorescence will have higher amounts of
blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And LED could be absolutely anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on what you're trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And LED is much more of an engineered
light source, an engineered solution to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to bring the benefits of those other
technologies, but in a very targeted way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's giving the light on the plant the
right spectrum that it needs at the right
[SPEAKER_02]: time and just trying to tailor that
spectrum to what the plant needs and at
[SPEAKER_02]: the basically benefit of energy
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take this back one step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there are limits to the usability of
our eyes to determine spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: for those of us who are not lighting
nerds, what are the tools that a
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator would use to measure these
light attributes that the eyes cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: handle?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, you know, you've got buckets and
you've got intensity, what are the tools
[SPEAKER_01]: of the trade, if you will, for those of us
who don't spend a lot of time with lights?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have hypersodium, there are rules
of thumbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal halide is about 15% blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypersodium is about 5% blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just think about it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're thinking about,
you know, what LED is going to do to
[SPEAKER_02]: replace either one of those, think about
what's going to have a similar blue light
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage as those two things,
5 or 15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you want to match.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you go to any credible LED
lighting manufacturer, that's the number
[SPEAKER_02]: that you want to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have published on there the
percentage of blue light on their
[SPEAKER_02]: specification sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you need to think about is
if you're thinking about it for a flower
[SPEAKER_02]: space where you're going to have high
pressure sodium normally, you want to have
[SPEAKER_02]: at least 5% blue, which the majority of
them all do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to have something that is
for a metal halide or a cool fluorescent
[SPEAKER_02]: space, you want to make sure that you're
north of 15%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you actually took that in a different
direction than I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you, I didn't realize that,
you know, I mean, I knew that the lights
[SPEAKER_01]: were sold with full spec sheets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I get that part, but I actually
thought you were going to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, we use these handheld technologies to
measure the buckets of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go back and we adjust our
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm kind of getting the idea is,
is that the spectrum is going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: on most lights, the spectrum is going to
come hardwired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you want to buy the spectrum from
the jump, from day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't like you're going to buy your
light and then tune your spectrum for what
[SPEAKER_01]: you personally like in your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are ways that you could do
it, but again, you're going to pay through
[SPEAKER_02]: the nose for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those meters that can do it are,
you know, a couple thousand dollars for a
[SPEAKER_02]: meter that could tell you what the
spectrum is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you don't really know what to do
with it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, it comes down to very simply
saying, okay, if this is, I just need to
[SPEAKER_02]: meet a minimum criteria so that things
don't get weird in my grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just a matter of looking at
the spec sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually, what I've seen is that every
LED light has kind of hit the threshold of
[SPEAKER_02]: what the minimum needs are for either one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might come across one that doesn't
have enough of the blue light content,
[SPEAKER_02]: but by and large, they almost all do
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way it's a lot harder to screw up,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you and I talked about before we got
going today, you know, I do a lot of work
[SPEAKER_01]: with patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while a lot of folks are focused on
commercial cultivation, my passion will
[SPEAKER_01]: still always be with these little home
growers trying to give themselves relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is incredibly common for them to
have these little plastic greenhouses or
[SPEAKER_01]: hoop houses where they've taken some kind
of skeleton of wood and they wrap it
[SPEAKER_01]: around in plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know from interviewing Eric
Branstad, the greenhouse specialist,
[SPEAKER_01]: that at the very least, we want to use
four-year horticultural plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people are still using
plastic sheeting, just from Home Depot,
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking that while it keeps the plants
dry, would you teach us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: what different plastics will do to the
light when it hits our plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe even more importantly,
how we will experience that in the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're growing for our medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So generally speaking, plastics don't do
well with UV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we kind of talked earlier that one of
the key benefits of sunlight is the UV
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going on, the other stuff that's
happening out there in the non-visual
[SPEAKER_02]: region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a horticulture grade lighting is going
to do better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, a horticultural grade plastic
is going to do better, is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand that those far ends of the
spectrum are important and try to allow
[SPEAKER_02]: them through.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cheaper plastics are not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are not going to consider what
those ends of the spectrum are going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally, they're going to be not the
best outdoor rated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what will happen, you'll notice that
they'll start yellowing over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll start becoming very brittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that yellowing is going to take a
lot of the blue out of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll drop the overall intensity,
but it's going to take out all the UV,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the blue light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the yellowing in the plastic or in the
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the yellowing is in the plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plastic will yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means it's attenuating more of
the UV.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's attenuating more of the blue light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now the plant's not getting things
that are vital for normal growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would strongly advise to get a
horticulture grade plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the decision rule that I was
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know how it is like when
you're working with any kind of a home
[SPEAKER_01]: grower, whether it's cannabis or
vegetables, there are so many variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many people don't have complete
knowledge that you go and you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, OK, they have
non-horticultural plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their plants are not doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it could also be because they screwed
up some other variable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to hear without any question
that not only does it make a difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it makes a big enough difference where
it's definitely worth springing in for the
[SPEAKER_01]: extra money to get the proper plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hey, before we wrap up here,
I want to ask you one question
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically about LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though you're an LED expert,
I really wanted to have you on the show
[SPEAKER_01]: today more because you are a lighting and
horticulture scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, there's a big
competition in our scene between LEDs and
[SPEAKER_01]: the traditional light mediums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're kind of like street gangs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not play soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get angry if they are dedicated to
HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you put out any kind of LED content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the flip, the LED people all
find themselves much more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_01]: and educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they talk all this trash about the HPS
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm all like, hey, man, I've had
really kick-ass flowers of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do know that LED has kind of just
kind of come into its own, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of flowers over the last 20,
I'll say 12 years that I've had from LED
[SPEAKER_01]: that just didn't rock my world,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as somebody who does LED
engineering, but also understands the
[SPEAKER_01]: fundamentals and why people choose HPS,
what are your thoughts on the threshold
[SPEAKER_01]: point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like have we passed that threshold point
now where LEDs have gotten to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: with spectrum and intensity, efficiency of
electrical usage, and price competition,
[SPEAKER_01]: where even the most hardcore HPS people
should start to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least read some websites about the LED
stuff because we've passed this threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have now had LED flower that is
fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while there's this whole secondary
thing about electrical usage, in my mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to the day where we
can have solar powered indoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we got a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some technologies that need to get
developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I prefer growing outdoors because the
sunshine is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the day will come where we can do
solar powered indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then it's all going to be on the
technology and it's going to decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question of efficiency will be out the
door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that very significant and yet
potentially convoluted setup, where do you
[SPEAKER_01]: see that threshold point is and have we
passed it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the threshold point really was,
can LED lighting serve as a thousand watt
[SPEAKER_02]: HPS replacement?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think until just very recently,
the answer has been no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that the majority of people
who have kind of been naysayers of LED
[SPEAKER_02]: have either been burned from generations
past or they've just kind of heard about
[SPEAKER_02]: it or they've kind of got the stigma that
it just can't put out the output.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyone who's said that, say five years
ago, were 100 percent correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the lighting industry did
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some people in the LED lighting
industry did themselves, just gave
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves a black eye by trying to say it
was a thousand watt HPS replacement by
[SPEAKER_02]: putting a meter directly underneath it and
going, see, you get the same light levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no one's thinking about what happens
at 10 degrees from underneath it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Underneath that light source.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now they have reached that threshold
where they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has been, you know, not everyone
could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a thermal exercise to try to get all
that heat out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a fundamental difference
between how traditional lights work,
[SPEAKER_02]: like high pressure sodium versus LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: High pressure sodium, you know,
it has a certain amount of efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whatever else is waste heat is heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it radiates that heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: LEDs are different because what is waste
heat is actually conducted away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, do I need to go over that again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear my phone ring just now?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, we got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and what happens is when that heat is
conducted away, it takes a certain amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of a thermal like device in order to get
that heat away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I could say very certainly is that
LED has been able to to hit that threshold
[SPEAKER_02]: and go over that hurdle of really truly
being a thousand watt high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_02]: replacement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, you know, you know,
I have a company and my company does it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not the only one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are, you know, kind of these tier
one manufacturers that can absolutely hit
[SPEAKER_02]: these thresholds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you, you know, if you were a
naysayer, you know, you're a smart man.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the time has come for LEDs to to kind
of hit hit that threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say if you're looking for a
very specific threshold, if it could get
[SPEAKER_02]: over 1600 micromoles per per second,
preferably 1750 micromoles per second,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is going to be something that you're
going to have a really good experience
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Robert, our time is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for all of this
interesting information and some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: atypical insights that we don't usually
hear when people are either talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: strictly the botany or strictly the light
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your your ability to kind of weave those
two together to provide some some answers
[SPEAKER_01]: that straight away rattled both
disciplines was really enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really had a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
