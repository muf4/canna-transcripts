[SPEAKER_02]: Polyculture is becoming really popular in
cannabis, both outdoors and even indoors
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea of polyculture, of course,
being planting other plants with your
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I personally
find really engaging about that is that
[SPEAKER_02]: when plants are grown near each other,
their roots in the rhizosphere can
[SPEAKER_02]: interact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for shorthand, we say that the plants
can talk to each other, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's certainly anthropomorphizing
it, making them sound like they have human
[SPEAKER_02]: attributes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you enlighten us at what is going on
biologically below the soil, which we are
[SPEAKER_02]: calling talking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, lots of different things,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with the mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that a plant can share mycorrhizal
fungi with other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you've got that kind of talking,
where nutrients are going to two different
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mycorrhizal fungi itself is feeding
both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's interaction as a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that carbon is transferred through
that mycorrhizal network from plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, so that the carbon goes into the
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you find that same radioactive
carbon in the plants that are nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know now that the plants sing link
system is very complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is something I tried to
cover in teaming with nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it gets very complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you think of any of the pictures
in teaming of nutrients of an individual
[SPEAKER_01]: cell, there are these embedded proteins
that are in the cell, some of which are
[SPEAKER_01]: outside the cell, and some of which are
inside the cytoplasm in the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are used for signaling often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll get, for example,
calcium, which is a very big signaling
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or nutrient element.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will rub against something on the
outside of the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a signal will go into the cytoplasm,
spread throughout the entire plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: because all of these cells are connected
with these little holes between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get these singlings often as a
result of things that are going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if the soil is low in nitrogen,
that signal will be sent throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since there are other plants in the
area, that signal will be sent through
[SPEAKER_01]: them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may not be them sending the signal,
but they're getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they might be carrying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're carrying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So below ground, you get all of that kind
of chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's chemical talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the bacteria talking to each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that is probably overheard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, anthropomorphicizing is definitely
the right word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overheard by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bacteria talk to each other in
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is getting cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They talk to each other in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't think the plant picks up
some of those terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I do the comparison is you're in a
big crowd and you smell somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that crowd, a perfume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smell a perfume from a woman far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're picking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a language between the two of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing happens in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also happens in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, I think it was the
University of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a situation where they had a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stimulated the plant in a way that
they could get a reaction from the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five miles, apparently, away in another
greenhouse, the plants react.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when an aphid hits a plant,
the plant goes, uh-oh, I can't run and go
[SPEAKER_01]: tell my little kids that are out there
that an aphid hit me, but I can send the
[SPEAKER_01]: signal out to them and does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other plants realize that there's
an aphid in the area and start preparing
[SPEAKER_01]: defenses for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a chemical talking, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do anthropomorphize it, if that's the
right way to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't mean it's not going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
