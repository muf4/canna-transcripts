[SPEAKER_02]: VSHLP, Vashon Island, Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Wednesday morning Scramble with
myself, Susan McKay-Bann.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Luke McQuillen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our special guest, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be here.
Welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shango, tell us, well, tell us your role
right now in the field of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm a little bit all over the place
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on the island, I continue to be the
founder of what was the local trade
[SPEAKER_00]: organization on the island, the Vashon
Island Marijuana Entrepreneurs Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the recent changes in the
dismantling of medical marijuana in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state, we've actually changed our name to
get in the spirit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're the Vashon Island Marijuana
Enthusiasts Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, we played the role of helping
medical marijuana producers on the island
[SPEAKER_00]: find reliable and legal channels to sell
their products in the rest of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since the medical industry has been
dismantled in the state, there's not much
[SPEAKER_00]: future in that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we switched over to the Enthusiasts
Alliance because now we're primarily an
[SPEAKER_00]: education organization reaching out to
patients and explaining marijuana and
[SPEAKER_00]: giving a lot of support for patients on
the island who don't know where else to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us what the laws regarding both
medicinal and recreational marijuana were
[SPEAKER_02]: before July.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before July, there were recreational
stores, but there were also dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: medical dispensaries that were not
licensed by the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a competition between the
licensed stores and the unlicensed stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had had medical in our state for 18
years prior to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some concerns about the
competition from the recreational stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the state wanted to capture
more of their taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they decided that it was in our
best interest to dismantle the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana stores and push those buyers to
their recreational stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that finally happened on in July,
as you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge is, is that while the
recreational stores will eventually have
[SPEAKER_00]: all the medical products, they don't have
them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and the price is much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the interim, the ones who are
losing are our most vulnerable population
[SPEAKER_00]: of patients because they didn't have the
political strength that for-profit
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses did to influence the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the for-profit businesses that sell
recreational marijuana basically
[SPEAKER_02]: prevailed, certainly with the state
legislature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so are all the medical dispensaries
just out of business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they're they're all out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we got a little press here on
Vashon a couple of weeks ago because our
[SPEAKER_00]: medical dispensary here on the island
never closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In July, when when the law changed simply
because they were never told.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensaries were all sent letters
from the state saying the law has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must now close.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we kind of slipped through
the cracks because we're in unincorporated
[SPEAKER_00]: King County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the the article that was written
about it, everybody was saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it wasn't my responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't my responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, we had we had the last medical
dispensary open in the state until until
[SPEAKER_00]: people noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you see as the future of legal
marijuana in Washington state?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, it's on the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, every month they're they're
returning more and more revenues as more
[SPEAKER_00]: people realize that a lot of the the
reefer madness taboos of the last 50 years
[SPEAKER_00]: were based on lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so there are more and more people
preferring to enjoy cannabis and and to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, often drink less as well,
because even though alcohol is more
[SPEAKER_00]: available, it's it's more dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but, you know, even though I'm
disappointed for the patients for right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and I and every day I work with
patients who cannot find access to the
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty cannabis preparations that they
look for, I do have faith that the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational system will come around
because there's there's people who want to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a there's a matter of time for
them to ramp up where they can find the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate strains, hire people who know
how to make the processes, develop their
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging, get them in the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just seeing the first inkling of
that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I figure a year from now,
those products will exist like more
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles and things of that nature that
specifically probably Rick Simpson oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: very clean, unflavored tinctures,
because a lot of things in the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational store, they're made for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they they add flavors and sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, real patients can't drink
THC infused soda pop, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they they're there's a lack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need things that are stripped down and
very simple and not quite as sexy as a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the stuff that's prep in the
recreational market right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are those preparations currently just
inaccessible for people who need them
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinally?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're inaccessible legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, everybody's gone back to the
black market with the way they used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if if if you used to be
on seizure medication and then you got
[SPEAKER_00]: turned on to medical cannabis prop
products and your seizures went away,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now the state says that you cannot
have those until they figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly you're told to go back to the
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most patients are saying, well,
forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the person that I used to buy
from in the medical industry is now just
[SPEAKER_00]: selling out of their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to continue to work with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're finding a lot more,
you know, what we call we like to call
[SPEAKER_00]: more the the informal market than what we
think of it as the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the black market's got such a bad
sound to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these are these are kind medical
providers who are artisans in their craft,
[SPEAKER_00]: providing for other people who are trying
to get relief from their ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for now, since a lot of those products
are not in the recreational market,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are finding their healing where
they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are those people at risk of prosecution
for selling in the informal market?
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how how adamant is the state being
about seeking those folks out and
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecuting them so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be selective enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how you're going about your
business, because it does seem that the
[SPEAKER_00]: state understands that there's a gap here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, they rolled out this new
policy where they were going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, essentially bless and certify
all these new recreational stores as being
[SPEAKER_00]: medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but, you know, there's only a handful
of those right now because the regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: or the how you apply is so complex and
burdensome financially to the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the state understands that there's
this gap right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there doesn't seem to be a huge
push to put all of these patient and
[SPEAKER_00]: patient providers behind bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, the folks who are producing
huge commercial amounts of plants or are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, also having fights on their
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the police come,
you know, that there are guns there and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's it's the way the way the
King County Sheriff said it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if if there's no problem,
there's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's a problem, there's a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this kind of gray area that
we're in right now, there doesn't seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lot of interest at the state level to
go after these small family businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: that are trying to provide for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when the rec stores get this,
you know, there's their shelves are filled
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, cannabis medicine type
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may see that change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, are those cannabis medical
products going to increase in price?
[SPEAKER_02]: And number two, can you give us a sense of
how many growers are still going on
[SPEAKER_02]: Vashon?
[SPEAKER_00]: So so for certain, the prices are higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about that, because the
state is is is charging a tax on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: both both a a a like a sin tax,
a vice tax, and then also just a simple
[SPEAKER_00]: sales tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, when you when you knew
who your medical provider was as a person,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would be able to let's say,
for example, you're you're looking to cure
[SPEAKER_00]: your cancer and you need 60 grams of Rick
Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go at a retail recreational store,
you're going to pay 60 times the price for
[SPEAKER_00]: one gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you were going to a medical
person, they'd say, oh, well, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a discount because
you're a cancer patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a drag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to give you some money off
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since you're going to buy 60 grams all
at once, we're also going to give you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a 40 percent discount because of
a bulk purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to a recreational store,
it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 60 times full price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, people who are treating
their cancer with cannabis are absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: getting their medicine in the in the
informal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so your second question about how
many people are growing still on the
[SPEAKER_00]: island, you know, the official answer for
you is zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, we know we know that's not
true, though, because Vashon's number one
[SPEAKER_00]: cash crop for the last 30 years has been
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we know that there are, you know,
we know that there are growers on the
[SPEAKER_00]: island, but they have all returned to the
to the shadows and deal with smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: groups of people and friends and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have we have several recreational
growers on the island like Vashon Velvet
[SPEAKER_00]: and Vashon Island Organics who are who are
on the island and represent us well in the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational market and have got very,
very fine products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they, you know, they don't necessarily
spend they're not processors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are not preparing these very
specific medical value added products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing really great flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they pass them on to processors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what the processors do with it is
their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Vashon Velvet has got this
fantastic reputation because they they not
[SPEAKER_00]: only are women owned and operated,
they use LED lights that use much less
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recycle their water and their their
flour is so exceptional that that they
[SPEAKER_00]: just roll most of it into what are called
pre rolls, which we would think of as
[SPEAKER_00]: joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sell them in in boxes directly to
the retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people just love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people say that they're they're
the best pre rolls in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have to have a lot of security?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would the short answer is yes,
because all of the medical growers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state have got, you know, video cameras
and gates or walled or walled buildings
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of the video is streamed to the
state so they can look at it at every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to that degree, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but, you know, you could be far worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not like it's a it's a bank
where they've all got armed guards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would that would not make the
business fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to back up just a little bit,
because you said something that alluded to
[SPEAKER_02]: the notion that Rick Simpson oil cures
cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that proven?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen it happen with patients
firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I first started in this,
I had only heard it anecdotally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I have seen I have directed
patients to places where they can get Rick
[SPEAKER_00]: Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've used it and their cancer has gone
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and all they were doing was using
cannabis oil and getting vitamin D,
[SPEAKER_00]: not injections, but whatever, getting
vitamin D as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so I've seen it now firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while these studies have not been
legal in the United States, they have been
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in Europe and specifically in
England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cannabis has been proven to
interrupt the cancer spread and to cause
[SPEAKER_00]: it to repeal back, decrease the activity
and eventually remove tumors to it's
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to put them all in the same
bucket because there's lots of different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, when you're using
cannabis oil to fight lymphoma,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to shrink down the tumors to
a one or two percent of what they were
[SPEAKER_00]: originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But often they won't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll get tests, tests every three
months and you'll you'll see that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas other more aggressive types of
cancer, you know, cannabis might not be
[SPEAKER_00]: that effective against simply because
cannabis doesn't have enough time to help
[SPEAKER_00]: the cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That because of the the course for for
beating cancer is three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if somebody if you get
someone who's stage four with an
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive cancer, it may be too late for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're really excited by all of the the
the true scientific studies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of Europe that show that that
cannabis stops and or cures cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the the government has got
a patent on using cannabis to cure cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have for a couple of decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, our government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: government holds this patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's interesting to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they just legalize cannabis
research for medicinal purposes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that's a accurate statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have they have opened up the the
application process to let a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of institutions apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still very controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, they have decided to move forward
with the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're talking with the cannabis
expert, Shane Goulos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, Luke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I said that's good news.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is good news.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know that all that research
was coming out of Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people want to learn more about it,
the website that I direct patients to is
[SPEAKER_00]: Project CBD dot o r g. It's a wonderful
website run by our friends at Project CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: down in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have done a lot of the hard
research for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the website, there's a
section that says conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you click on conditions,
it shows you this whole page list of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the different conditions that cannabis
helps with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you click on the particular
condition, it gives you links to all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the scientific studies in PubMed dot gov
showing the support for cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping with Alzheimer's and cancer and
arthritis and autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's a it's an amazing list.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis, was the primary part
of the pharmacopoeia before it was banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly, you know, we've been using
cannabis for generations upon generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then suddenly, for for political
reasons, you know, they they banned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then the pharmaceutical companies
jumped in to fill the void so they could
[SPEAKER_00]: sell their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now with the taboo decreasing and
people starting to realize more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were lied to for political
reasons, people are realizing that the the
[SPEAKER_00]: old reliable herb of marijuana is
something that that we should get back to
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you know, it's non
addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is no one has ever died from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the worst thing that can happen is
you can accidentally over medicate and and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe be uncomfortable and kind of
paranoid for 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if that's your worst symptom,
that's way better than any of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: options for most of these ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: That website, does it have recipes on
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know that there's lots of
different combinations of what what type
[SPEAKER_01]: of mixture that you give for each type of
medical condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have those recipes on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you have to sort of figure that out
on your own?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are there places that you can actually
get specific stuff for specific ailments?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that is a question that's right
on the edge of the kind of information
[SPEAKER_00]: that's available publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is this is what I teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak often to doctor and naturopath
groups explaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this ailment, you want to have some
thing that's this this many milligrams of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and this many milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and some things you want to treat
with more of an indica strain and some
[SPEAKER_00]: things you want to treat with more of a
sativa strain to talk real generally about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know if that's specifically
on the project CBD dot org website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly inside of the studies that
they're quoting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in in the UK, they have a
drug made by GW Pharmaceutical called
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativax, and it is used by patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but but really, if you look at if you
look what the ingredients is, it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: simply a one to one preparation of THC and
CBD at at three, like three and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per dose and and use until you
have relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, heck, we have people on the island
who make that as a tincture, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it didn't have to go through all of
the laborious, you know, whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: British version of the FDA is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but it's it's the way that nature
intended that healing to happen instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: the the the repackaging it as a
pharmaceutical product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I know that that's a long answer to
your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but, you know, well, I have to admit
that I was I had a really severe back
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had spinal stenosis and it lasted about
two years until I couldn't take any more
[SPEAKER_01]: and I finally got surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a green card recipient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the things I was trying to
specifically I didn't want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to relieve some of the pain
and not take all the oxycodone or any of
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really was worse for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was having a difficult time finding
that particular combination that would
[SPEAKER_01]: really help.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't a real hard and fast recipe
that I could use every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'd go to the medical marijuana
place and a lot of times there'd be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, edibles were more what I would
rather do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found a hard time getting to know
what those combinations were and what the
[SPEAKER_01]: balances were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you're not alone with what
you're asking is a pretty sophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: question and is going to be out of the
experience of a lot of the bud tenders
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would have spoken to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, number one, it certainly
wouldn't recommend smoking cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that you're going to
want to tincture for or potentially an
[SPEAKER_00]: edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, because you've got heavy
neuropathic pain, you're going to want a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of CBD in there to boost your
endocannabinoid system because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's signaling issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixed in with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you were probably, you know,
had had actual physical pain issues and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably especially at night, because if
you rolled over, you had pain with and
[SPEAKER_00]: woke you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you have insomnia, which then I
would recommend an indica tincture on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of that to act as a muscle relaxant and
help you sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then so then I would have
suggested, you know, 10 to 20 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD a day with a little bit of THC in
there to take advantage of the entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, how they work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the evening, an indica
tincture to help your body relax and help
[SPEAKER_00]: you slip into sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not a lot of people have that level of
sophistication at the retail level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, or that kind of information,
because they're obviously you're clear on
[SPEAKER_02]: how all this works.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking with Shango Lowes,
who is a cannabis expert and Vashon
[SPEAKER_02]: Islander, who just sat here and gave a
prescription for stenosis pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is fairly complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious about how many American
physicians are latching on to this idea
[SPEAKER_02]: and actually prescribing cannabis for
cancer or for spinal pain or other kinds
[SPEAKER_02]: of pain conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the folks who both know how to
recommend a particular cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation and are in favor it,
they could probably fit in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, though, the number of doctors who
are becoming in favor of cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the kind of information that they need
to feel empowered to make these
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations are increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the likelihood of them running into an
insurance problem, practicing recommending
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're on the right side of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is not a lot of it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of not there's not a lot of folks
recommending that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that those are the folks that I
talk to all the time, because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even necessarily want it to go on their
resume that they've learned this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but their patients are asking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I am very often invited to,
you know, per private homes where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a room, there's going to be a
couple, you know, Western doctors,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple naturopaths, a couple of nurses,
maybe a patient or two, somebody who's
[SPEAKER_00]: significant, others really sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just sit around and talk and I
teach what I have learned during my years
[SPEAKER_00]: of doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have a better frame of
reference to put all the other information
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're learning because there's so
much noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants to talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the information is very low
quality.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shingo Los, you are the president of the
IMEA Vashon Vashon Island Marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: Enthusiast Alliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a fairly beyond the island
career as well in in cannabis information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, now it's leaning more towards media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was doing a lot of brand strategy and
startup business consulting for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: companies when they existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then they went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so and I've worked with some
recreational producers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during the transition, I found that
what I had to offer, I mean, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a lifelong brand strategist and can
talk business, the part that I had that
[SPEAKER_00]: was valuable was the experience with
cannabis business, specifically the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of products and working with
patients, because that's where my passion
[SPEAKER_00]: is, is working with patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just you know, I talk to
patients every day on the island who come
[SPEAKER_00]: to me for advice and direction about where
they can get these medicines, either
[SPEAKER_00]: through the recreational stores or
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so I moved into media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a I've got a podcast at
shaping fire dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is actually launching in a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently just left my role as a founder
of the podcast at gongepreneur dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did fifty four episodes for them,
but decided it was time to go out on my
[SPEAKER_00]: own so I could have a little more control.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so shaping fire is going to launch
here in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I travel the country a lot,
spending a lot of time in California right
[SPEAKER_00]: now teaching both cannabis business owners
and also patients and sharing what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: what I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any stores in I'm not asking you
necessarily to name them per se,
[SPEAKER_01]: but are there some stores that have sort
of gotten on the bandwagon with medical
[SPEAKER_01]: products, marijuana products in Seattle
that patients here like on Daschon can go
[SPEAKER_01]: to?
[SPEAKER_00]: The short answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The long answer is no, because the problem
is, is that the stores may be on board,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's not enough being produced that
they can keep it on their shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, they might get in some
some Rick Simpson oil and people notice it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they tell their friend and they're
sold out in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so there are there are there are
like, for example, you know, Seattle
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Company, you know, they're
they're right off the the West Seattle
[SPEAKER_00]: Bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they've got a great staff
that does, you know, that educates folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but they have a hard time keeping this
stuff on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need more processors to produce
more of this medical product so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, nearby, you know,
we've got three directions where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: take ferries, you know, southward Seattle
and the south end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are there are recreational
stores on all three ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're to the point now that
we're just we being the Vashon Island
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Enthusiast Alliance,
we're just starting to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with these folks so that we
can recommend them confidently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can I can say nice things about
Seattle Cannabis Company on first because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm friends and I know several of the bud
tenders there and they come out to Vimeo
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings and I know they're doing their
own education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so I know that they're forthright
folks who are doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we don't have a relationship
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are more and more of the
recreational stores that are hiring people
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shingo Lose, how do people get a hold of
you to get more information about medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana and and cannabis in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they reach you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can certainly go to my website
at Shingo Lose dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get in contact with me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also find out, you know,
upcoming events that I'm either speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: at or happening here on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you come back and update us as the
medical marijuana business grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is a couple on island events before I go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so first of all, on October 7th,
I've been invited to do a talk on medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana at the Vashon Senior Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the second time I've spoken
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time it was standing room only a real
popular event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's on Friday, October 7th
at one o'clock in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next Vimeo meeting is
Wednesday, September 28th.

Lowerman, who will be speaking on
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting and curing your summertime
outdoor home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's at seven p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Grange Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for cannabis folks on the island
who are interested in working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry this Sunday,
September 18th, I'll be offering the
[SPEAKER_00]: keynote at the Juana Career Fair in
Bellevue at the Red Lion Hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're going to have a bunch of
cannabis companies who are hiring now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're meeting folks and collecting
resumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will also be cannabis employment
experts talking about how to prepare a
[SPEAKER_00]: resume for cannabis and just generally
giving good advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is this information also available at
shangalose.com?
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all available in the events section
at shangalose.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did your parents name you that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I changed my name about 20 some years ago
when I moved to California.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and a whole lot of other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll look forward to talking with you
more.

Springsteen song.
