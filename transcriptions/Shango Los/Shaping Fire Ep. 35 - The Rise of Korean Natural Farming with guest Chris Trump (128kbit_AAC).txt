[SPEAKER_00]: Fermenting has become wildly popular in
the last decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere you look, people are drinking
kombucha and water kefir, and other folks
[SPEAKER_00]: are making fermented pickles and
sauerkraut or homemade yogurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In each of these examples, the goal is to
make an environment beneficial to
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms so they thrive and
multiply.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same thing that probiotic
farmers are trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just trying to jam the plant
full of nutrients, a probiotic farmer is
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a soil environment where life is
abundant and naturally creates the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thriving plant comes from making healthy
soil, not trying to force feed it
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Korean natural farming, known shorthand as
KNF, is next-level probiotic farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: KNF ferments a wide variety of naturally
occurring substances, from plant and fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: juices to fish carcasses and seawater,
in order to help indigenous bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, nematodes, and protozoa to thrive
and produce fertile soils that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: require pesticides, herbicides,
or synthetic fertilizer inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In essence, KNF takes the principles found
in making tasty-to-eat kimchi and
[SPEAKER_00]: reapplies them to the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Master Cho Han-ku invented the Korean
natural farming method by blending Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: farming and fermenting techniques with
those of natural farming teachers he met
[SPEAKER_00]: while studying in Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 1992, he had begun an epic 21-part
series in Modern Agriculture magazine on
[SPEAKER_00]: his newly established methods,
and in 1995 he opened the Natural Farming
[SPEAKER_00]: Life School and Research Farm in Korea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This school is the source of these
inventive techniques that are taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world by storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, everybody in probiotic cannabis
growing is talking about KNF right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn about cannabis
health, business, and technique

[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Trump is a master natural farmer,
certified by Master Cho of Korea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also studied microbial analysis under
Dr. Elaine Ingram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many consider Chris' YouTube videos
explaining Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques to have been the key to KNF's
wildly increasing popularity in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also helpful that Chris is a
certified KNF educator who actually speaks
[SPEAKER_00]: English.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we'll be going over the central
ideas of KNF and discussing recipes for
[SPEAKER_00]: Korean farming's exceptionally alive
inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know your time is valuable,
so thanks for peeling off a little bit for
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as I've already mentioned to
folks, I am new to Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been into probiotics for a while,
but people are getting more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about KNF as the teaching finds
its way around the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, let's start.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see as the difference between
probiotics farming and living soils versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the specifics of Korean natural farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it simply a subset of probiotic
farming, or do you see it kind of as its
[SPEAKER_00]: own thing for some reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's all nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best any of this is really doing is
working the way nature already works,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's optimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if somebody's doing probiotic farming,
or focusing on living soil, if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it well, it is very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Korean natural farming, one of the core
principles is the idea of indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, where you might buy bugs in a jug,
some product made somewhere that somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: said is really good, or they found success
with, those we found may or may not
[SPEAKER_01]: persist in your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, depending on your temperature,
or your moisture, or just the microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: that are already present, you might have a
six-month fall off with some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: purchased microorganism mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that's always how it is,
but with indigenous biology, so if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: an indigenous microorganism, if you're
farming an acre of land, and you go up the
[SPEAKER_01]: hill, and you collect something that
exists in the wild forest, and bring it
[SPEAKER_01]: down, we're very confident that that will
persist in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for however many thousands of
years, or whatever period of time that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been undisturbed, or gotten established,
it's thrived in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, by moving it downhill, or a mile
across town, it's still gonna like your
[SPEAKER_01]: rainfall, your temperature, your
barometric pressure, and the general soil
[SPEAKER_01]: mix, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even play well with the microbes on
your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk a lot on this show about
bioregions, and making sure that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the strains that work for where
you live, if you're growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this seems to be a real obvious
extension of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, work with the microbes that are
comfortable with your area and your
[SPEAKER_00]: weather, instead of necessarily recruiting
bugs in a bottle, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: to add them, and then just hope that they
do good where you happen to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, at the cornerstone of KNF would be
simply recruiting your volunteer microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: from your neighborhood, and then feeding
them what they want, so that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: motivated to stay and to increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's not to say that bugs in a
jug wouldn't help your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just may be that you just gotta keep
buying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, if you're establishing something
that will persist, you're basically
[SPEAKER_01]: building a battery of health and vitality
in your soil that will be there,
[SPEAKER_01]: year after year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you mentioned that as one of the key
tenants of KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you have any other key tenants of
KNF that you think are good to start with?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the first time I spent a long
period of time with Chohan Yu,
[SPEAKER_01]: Master Cho, we looked at our notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sitting next to my friend,
Pancho San Pedro, who's the head of Crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: Horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Neil Young, Crazy Horse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's Crazy Horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sitting there, and we're looking at
our notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a day or two of getting into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Master Cho and his daughter was there,
Ju Young.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, every other word's love.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole thing, there's agriculture,
agriculture, love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture, love.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's taken me a bit, or initially it
took me a bit as a commercial farmer to be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, okay, what does love have to do with
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say, as far as natural farming
goes, it is a core tenant in that it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: mindset or a position to farm from where
if you are caring for things, or treating
[SPEAKER_01]: them as you might a child, where it's
like, oh, it's just good enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're kind of like, no, let me
practice or learn to do this well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a result that has to do with this
kind of invisible component that is the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer's attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have that, I mean, culturally we've
seen that over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have these sayings in livestock,
the eye of the farmer fattens the cow,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the shadow of the farmer makes the
plants grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are nods towards something
that's the invisible component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so there's that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a deeper philosophical
rabbit trail, but it is important in this
[SPEAKER_01]: type of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the communication of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that just about anybody
who's attracted to either just generally
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotic growing, or specifically KNF,
they've got to have some of that in their
[SPEAKER_00]: heart though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because generally people who are
ruthlessly corporate growers, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing out of bottles, and they are
pushing nature to take from nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get nature to produce for them,
versus all the farmers that I know who are
[SPEAKER_00]: using probiotic growing techniques are
doing it because they're in love with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, they're in love with their land,
they don't want to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a evil runoff of their property going into
the streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that just, you know,
farmers generally with love in their
[SPEAKER_00]: hearts will find their way to this kind of
farming one, you know, eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not to say it's not this like,
it's not to say it's not about being
[SPEAKER_01]: profitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it isn't, they aren't mutually
exclusive to have a care for what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing or profitability.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely both, you know,
as we toured Korea, one of the only things
[SPEAKER_01]: he would ask, Master Che would ask these
farmers doing natural farming is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how much money are you making?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and they're obviously caring for
what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they have, you know, whether it's
pigs or crops, just beautiful and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, I was pretty jealous when I saw
persimmon farm where it's just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't, they haven't fertilized in 11
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just have, it looks like 23 acres
of a tree that if, you know, Mr. Miyagi
[SPEAKER_01]: had one baby, he would have, you know,
it's like 23 acres of perfectly groomed,
[SPEAKER_01]: beautifully productive persimmons,
and they haven't fertilized in 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he asked them how much money they
make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're, by and large, the answers I
heard, they're far more profitable than we
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some, some of that has to do with
its family operations where they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: paying workman comp, you know,
they're running these, these things with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, two people, my husband and wife,
and they're killing it on a couple acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but yeah, it's anyways, I just wanted
to clarify, just because we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about love doesn't mean it's not viable to
make a living on as a person or family
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much about sustainability,
meaning that you don't have to work a
[SPEAKER_01]: second job to sustain your farming habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that I think that's a good thing for
you to point out too, especially since a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a great deal of the audience for
this show are commercial cannabis growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, there are people who they
want to, you know, they're, they may have
[SPEAKER_00]: the heart and the love, but at the end of
the day, they need to make sure that what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing has got high yield is,
is developing a fantastic terpene profile
[SPEAKER_00]: and that they're locking down as much bag
appeal as they can without going indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, if, if people knew
that they, they could use this tech,
[SPEAKER_00]: these techniques, but they would lose
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they sure as heck wouldn't be as
popular, but, but you know, we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know darn well that using probiotic and
KNF techniques actually just makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then also, so your yields
are going up and, and so is the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we finally hit that pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, no till is also becoming
really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, would you consider no till to be an
essential part of KNF as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't want to break up the,
the community in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, it's definitely in the same
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're with natural farming,
you're not, you're not tilling as a
[SPEAKER_01]: general rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're, if you're coming into a brand
new area and it's full of grass or some
[SPEAKER_01]: other, you know, wild crop or,
or weed, you're, you're probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have to deal with that in that first
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's encouraged that you're not
beating your head against the wall,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to grow around or through the grass
that's super thick and beating out or out
[SPEAKER_01]: competing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need to till or spade or do
something the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're counting on that,
that network that is established of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal network and all these little
organisms, part of the soil food web to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow the food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going in and slamming them all with
equipment at the end of every season is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was first starting to read about
KNF, one of the things that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the, one of the explanations that
really hit me was about soil nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you actually just hit it talking about
that persimmon farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to set you up and I'd
like you to just kind of explain it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, because you said that that
persimmon farm that you saw had not
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilized in like 11 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a perfect example because
normally the trees get rid of the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they're there, then they are in
the soil and then they rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plant is self-fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you go a little more in depth about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the principle in nutrition is the
right amount at the right time means that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have far less quantity of input
than if you're just trying to preload a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole growing cycles food in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like that, that persimmon farm,
I mean, they, they use a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: composting, you know, or, or mulching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they mulch, but, but not, not a ton of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they don't need to, the rainfall is
sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With, depending on your crop, some crops
need, they really do need nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_01]: their vegetative growth cycle,
especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is nutrients available,
but like we, we farm 750 acres of
[SPEAKER_01]: macadamia nuts with natural farming in
Hawaii organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of nitrogen we use on our
farm now, it's all grown with Korean
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming is homeopathic to put a
descriptive word to it compared to the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry recommended nitrogen amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the experts in our industry look at it
and they're like, well, you'll,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll never get yields with that amount
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, you know, five years later,
they're like, so what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you speak at our international
conference?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, because our yields are
increasing year after year, we're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: increased yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our entire island yields are in
decline and they're thinking, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: the trees are too old, but we have the
oldest trees on the island on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're increasing year after year with
this tending to the life of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to the persimmon example,
so since, so since on this show we're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, our, our, our, our target crop
is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and since the persimmon tree,
you know, to its, to its advantage,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the leaves fall and it's already
used the key components to make the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the, and then in the fall
they fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they, they, they, then they rot at
the base of the tree and then they go into
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of self,
self-fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that's not the case with cannabis
plants, essentially what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is to feed the microorganisms that are
in the soil and kind of replace what would
[SPEAKER_00]: happen if we just let the cannabis plants
go through their season and then degrade
[SPEAKER_00]: and die, you know, after they see the soil
below them so that they're ready to go in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we're, we're just trying to help
replace the nature since we are,
[SPEAKER_00]: we pull the plants out and we don't let
them die right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going for maximum yields in
your, your square footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're, you're trying to replace
nature, but you're also, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we use specific sprays or liquid
nutrients at each stage of say a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis plant loves about a 30 to one
fungal to bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're IMO or you're tending of the
microbial life in your soil is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the huge component to have healthy disease
resistance, pest resistance, even if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're healthy and have good biology,
microbiology going on in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but then there is, because we're kind
of intensively farming, there is the need
[SPEAKER_01]: to apply nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're to get, you know,
to maximize yields in your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bringing in like a fish amino acid,
a nitrogen source at the right time and
[SPEAKER_01]: the right amount is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not like frowned upon in
natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, it is about maximizing yields,
but it's also recognizing that the,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a cost to fertilizer that affects
your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a cannabis industry, like in
California, they're kind of going through
[SPEAKER_01]: a paradigm shift as they look,
look at, okay, I'm not going to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 2,500 a pound anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I got to, I got to figure out the new
normal, which is definitely sub sub a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand and, and find out what my bottom
line is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might mean that they have to look
at what they're paying for fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs and labor, and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and there's, there's hope,
you know, this, this doesn't have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking the bank to make highly
productive, beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you who are listening and
you're just like dying for us to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the techniques and you're less interested
in the, in the background that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, make sure you stay to the second
set where we're going to be, we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be talking about the various
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, we're going to take our first
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is Korean natural
farming educator, Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using pesticides when growing cannabis has
been common for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays though, we know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that most pesticides formulated
for food crops have never been tested for
[SPEAKER_00]: use with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested to be eaten in tiny
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not been tested to be inhaled
and especially not concentrated into a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical residues from pesticides are not
healthy for anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are especially dangerous for
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: For commercial cannabis growers,
this has become very impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis enthusiasts and patients have
gotten educated enough that they avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who used pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but states across the
country have begun making pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: testing mandatory on all licensed cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time has come to find a better way to
fight garden pests than covering your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let some good bugs fight your bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects and predatory mites
have come a long way since we were buying
[SPEAKER_00]: ladybugs online and putting them in the
grow room and just hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural enemies biocontrol can help you
solve pest issues without using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural enemies founder, Shane Young,
learned best practices from working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry and has fine
tuned those strategies specifically for
[SPEAKER_00]: large cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane works with commercial cannabis
clients across the country to ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they keep their crops safe and pest free
without the use of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural enemies has proven solutions for
spider mites, aphids, thrips, russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, broad mites, shore flies,
white fly and others too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rely on natural enemies for
expertise and excellent service.

.com forward slash natural enemies or
[SPEAKER_00]: simply click on their banner in this
week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a listener of Shaping Fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: by out-competing potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy mammoth pea near you, check out
[SPEAKER_00]: their website at www.mammothmicrobes.com.

beautiful, thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shane Golos, and our guest
this week is Chris Trump, Korean natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris, during the first set,
we were kind of given a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: background of it, but in this set,
we're going to talk very specific about
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the techniques that we're learning
from Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one phrase that is throughout the
literature is this BSJ, brown sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: jaggery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and talk a little bit
about that first before we get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: different things we're going to do about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this brown sugar jaggery?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's funny because as we first were
learning this, as this kind of first
[SPEAKER_01]: landed in Hawaii from Korea, there was a
significant learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just from learning the new method,
but just a translation journey where not
[SPEAKER_01]: only are we translating from Korean to
English, we're translating from Korean
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, idioms, and indigenous plants and
products to English and American mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a huge process for kind of
everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something, hopefully, that in the
education going forward, people don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to go through that painstaking journey
that we went through in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can learn from the years of
experience we've had since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But brown sugar is used in Korean natural
farming and a lot of the fermentation
[SPEAKER_01]: processes with fruits and plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a vital component.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salt is used.
[SPEAKER_01]: But brown sugar and jaggery, that was one
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in America, you go to Costco and you
buy brown sugar, and really that's
[SPEAKER_01]: processed sugar with some molasses added
back in to make it brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was white sugar, and then they
browned it with adding the molasses back
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when this first communicated,
what we're talking about is just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cheap, unprocessed sugar you can get
in Korea or some of these other Asian
[SPEAKER_01]: countries, which is just kind of lightly
processed cane sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it still has kind of the natural
molasses in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of mainly what that's
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can just get brown sugar from
Costco, that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you get some unprocessed sugar,
there's a bunch of different types that
[SPEAKER_01]: are available in the US where it's just
kind of sugar in the raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to buy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a brand name on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really expensive, but it's the same
concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just unprocessed cane sugar or less
processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the word jaggery, it sounds so exotic,
though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like unprocessed sugar doesn't have
the same spin to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least you know it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start at the top of the list with
these amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in an order of what,
at least to me anyway, seems like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've only made it through the first
few.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my goal here is that we can start with
something that sounds simple so that folks
[SPEAKER_00]: who are listening are like, oh,
I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we go through this long second
set, they'll get increasingly more
[SPEAKER_00]: complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we'll probably lose some people at
fish amino acids, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with maltose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So break down how people would use maltose
and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maltose is something used in Korean
fermentation in a bunch of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the US, that kind of translates
into some of the things we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: For beer production, maltose for us as
American farmers is super helpful and not
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's as we looked at kind of
translating these concepts from Korean
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, where some things are super
readily available and everybody knows how
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it, to US culture and what we have
available, some of the maltose use got
[SPEAKER_01]: dropped in place of just getting an
inexpensive beer rather than making your
[SPEAKER_01]: own rice beer or rice wine, which maltose
is used for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting because when I first
got started, I'm like, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: you sprout the barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you crushed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you remove the foam from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I continued to look for something that
I would then put that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I didn't know any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just added it to my rainwater that I
was using for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are you saying that folks are not
really using this as much anymore because
[SPEAKER_00]: there are other KNF techniques that cover
that same ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you saying that people just don't
bother making it themselves anymore?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wanted to make your own brown
rice vinegar, you could go through this
[SPEAKER_01]: elaborate process to make the brown rice
vinegar and maltose is involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to make makgeolli,
which is Korean rice beer, which is really
[SPEAKER_01]: tasty and I highly recommend going on that
journey if that interests you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we've actually just that's kind
of been edited out of the journey for kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of an American natural farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, it's still cool and it
still has a role if you wanted to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can do natural farming without
ever creating your own maltose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I only bothered to
do once because as soon as I got turned on
[SPEAKER_00]: to the second one, we're going to talk
about making lactic acid bacteria from a
[SPEAKER_00]: rice water wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seemed to be the first one that
really hit and caused my plants to jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you explain a rice water wash and
how to ferment it and why this matters to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of what you can buy in the store,
if somebody's making you a microbe
[SPEAKER_01]: amendment, a lot of it is based in the
lactobacilli family of bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: which spans a bunch of little
subcategories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea in Korean natural farming,
LAB, Lactic Acid Bacteria, is that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: culture it from your area, from the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make it yourself in a really effective
and simple method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then have freshly brewed kind of
highly active lactic acid bacteria from
[SPEAKER_01]: your environment to apply on your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not super expensive, so milk
isn't super cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty doable and accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: For farmers, and I think a lot of the kind
of probiotic cannabis farmers probably
[SPEAKER_01]: started with the LAB.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you go ahead and for the people
who have never created this, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you walk them through, walk us all
through a recipe that they can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap their heads around?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously, if somebody really
wants to get into this stuff, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to follow up on the episode that
we're doing today with some Googling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to get something that's line by
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so people can get their heads wrapped
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you explain how one would do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny because I grew up in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was born and raised in Hawaii and
everybody knows to make rice in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And coming to being involved in mainland
US, some people were like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you do with rice?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the normal, often when you make
rice, you'll give it a rinse first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of to take some of the
extra kind of dust off your rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody does it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes it less sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it a little less sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this LAB recipe, you take your rice
as if you were going to make yourself a
[SPEAKER_01]: pot of rice and you just fill up some
water in your dry rice and rinse it around
[SPEAKER_01]: and the water will become kind of milky
and white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you pour that off into a clean
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one place people always or often fail
in this process is by having a little soap
[SPEAKER_01]: scum left in the container they just
washed out for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have soap left in that jar where
you pour your rice wash water it won't go
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't actually produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacterias will be inhibited by the
soap remaining in that jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just make sure real thorough rinse pro
tip there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But go ahead and take that rice wash
water, set it in a cool and hopefully not
[SPEAKER_01]: direct sunlight spot with a breathable lid
like a piece of paper towel or paper
[SPEAKER_01]: napkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let that sit for about anywhere from
one to three days, generally, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: your temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's really warm where you are,
this might only take a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's cooler, you know, in the 50s,
it could take up to five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can put it outside without it
getting messed with, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have it under a tree and it's
protected from the rain and the wind's
[SPEAKER_01]: able to blow over it, you're going to get
all the good biology microbes floating in
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeze that can jump in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, a lot of what's going to be
in there is just, you know, what was in
[SPEAKER_01]: the air when it got poured in and on your
hands even, which, you know, use clean
[SPEAKER_01]: hands when you make this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after about two or three days,
it will change its smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is ever so slight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very slight alteration in smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to be smelling it regularly
and all of a sudden it'll have just the
[SPEAKER_01]: slightest sweet smell to put a taste to a
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just a little bit of a hint of
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the slightest change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you sense just a tiny change,
it's probably ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it smells at all rotten or super sour,
it went too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You missed that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take that rice wash water and
you add it in a jar at a rate of one part
[SPEAKER_01]: rice wash water to 10 parts milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get whole milk, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be store bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to drink it yourself,
you know, as a health thing, then you
[SPEAKER_01]: probably go for the milk that you would
want to drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're feeding it, if you're
putting it on soil, I would just encourage
[SPEAKER_01]: you to not spend a ton of money on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, add it one part rice wash water
to 10 parts milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in a cool place out of direct
sunlight with a breathable lid,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, like a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use a rubber band to put it around
the lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you leave that and should be around
five days, two to five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll have a separating of the curds
and the whey, just like Miss Muppet ate
[SPEAKER_01]: when she sat on her tuffet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the yellow serum or the clear serum
that forms in the jar is your whey
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where all your LAB activity is
going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the curds is your casein protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two proteins in milk will separate
due to fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You extract your whey from the curds or
strain them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can let some of the whey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use something that's fine as a
t-shirt cloth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use something too thick,
like a strainer or too porous,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a strainer, you're going to get a lot
of cloudiness from the curds going,
[SPEAKER_01]: staying in your LAB serum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really you want it to be clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to use something like a t-shirt
and then yeah, you pull off your curds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make cheese with that or just eat
them, mix them with something and eat
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feed them to your livestock or
your animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that liquid, that clear liquid
that you have left, you can store in your
[SPEAKER_01]: fridge with a breathable lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that you can use on your plants at a
rate of one to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one part LAB to a thousand parts water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's excellent for all kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of applications of that in
the next natural farming toolkit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as adding it to your cannabis
plants goes, there's a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that you can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that people should know
that they could both pour it into their
[SPEAKER_00]: soil directly, but it also works really
great as a foliar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the rate of one to a thousand,
it's really safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to cause shock or any kind
of damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to cause any kind of over
concentration issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I was curious about
is once you've gotten to this point and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in your fridge and your ratio is one
to a thousand, chances are that the LAB
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have made, it's going to last for
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really know how long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a way that you can extend
the life of it so you're not having to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it, you know, every couple of weeks,
what's your experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like in a fridge with a
breathable lid, you have vitality for
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere from one to two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't feel like that, that you got to
use it within the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still real viable within a couple of
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't go beyond a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that third month that you're
probably losing some of the vitality you
[SPEAKER_01]: had initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that temperature in a refrigerator,
it's really, everything's going to slow
[SPEAKER_01]: down and kind of just go to sleep or calm
down a lot of their processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you're really going to get a
great storage in a fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had a store without refrigeration,
you could mix it equal mass with brown
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can measure that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That by weight or generally volume,
you really want to put a ton of brown
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all the water's kind of tied up in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can store that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stores less.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say a month would be the max on a
non-refrigerated kind of brown sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not recommended to store it with
molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Korean natural farming, but you got to
do what you can with what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to our next amendment
because rice water wash is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people who are new to this,
it is a, I can speak for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good confidence builder,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do that, as simple as it is and
it goes right, you're like, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, the next one that we're going
to talk about fermented fruit juice also
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the internet as FFJ, this was the
first thing that I came across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm like, all right, this is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and then I heard the term Korean
natural farming for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similar to like what we just did with
the rice water wash, would you explain
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented fruit juice and, and,
and then how, how you choose your fruits
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and then how you do your ferment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me touch on, if it's all right with
you, Shango, the, some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: misconceptions I've seen on the internet
regarding FFJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: So FFJ is used in natural farming and
fairly limited kind of amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use it for ripening promotion in
fruit and a few other inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in, in the cannabis world,
it seemed to have been adopted as a thing
[SPEAKER_01]: for fruits, meaning bud production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's a little bit of a
mistranslation of the, of the concepts in
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's not so much intended for
that purpose, believe it or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: FPJ is actually what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we can get into that next.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure fermented plant juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fermented fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second kind of misnomer I've
seen in just some of the information on
[SPEAKER_01]: the internet is that you just want to buy
the best things you can from the store to
[SPEAKER_01]: make your FFJ with, and that all these
tropical fruits are using in Hawaii or
[SPEAKER_01]: these things are the best when again,
that's not really the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you want to get if you're doing FFJ
is you want to find the things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can find wild in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this goes all the way back to what
you started with, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you want to use the microbes that you
find in your neighborhood so that they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they live where you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's, there's some, there's some
real benefit to getting the beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemicals that are in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants that thrive in your environment
and the plant growth hormones that are
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh, they're not something that was
picked green, got ripe in the truck coming
[SPEAKER_01]: across the world and has been sitting and
kind of calming down in all its really
[SPEAKER_01]: vibrancy for weeks and before it even gets
to ferment in your fermentation vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it has none of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeasts and bacteria on its surface that
helped it grow because that was all bleach
[SPEAKER_01]: washed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people get these really funky green
molds and stuff forming on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's mostly because none of that
bio, none of those microbes that worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with that plant for it to grow in a
symbiotic way were present when they began
[SPEAKER_01]: their fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just getting whatever was on
their hands or in their jar or which isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really sufficient or proper for this type
of fermentation that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: accomplish.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want a plant to ferment in its
own microbiology or microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So FFJ is a combination of three ripe
fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this could be strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be, it could be even like things
we don't normally eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh man, I can't think of off the top
of my head, Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like rose hips, if you're thinking about
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rose hips are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see all kinds of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rose hips, squash, you know, yeah,
there's, there's all kinds of anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can think of that ripens to a
ripe fruit, even if it's wild and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: not really a normal thing you would eat,
but say the birds eat it, those are all
[SPEAKER_01]: your, your ripe fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you could harvest those with FFJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use up to three fruits and it's
actually recommended to use three
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more complex biologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just ripe fruits have kind of,
they've, they've processed to a different
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and kind of what's going on in
biochemicals and plant growth hormone and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff, which is, you know,
it's, it's not, it's a part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, science is working hard to
understand all that's going on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three different fruits, you mix it with
equal weights brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have five pounds of a variety of
fruit, you get five pounds of brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, if your fruits really dry,
maybe your rose hips have almost no
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can start with less sugar for,
but generally the rule is one-to-one sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: by weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You massage it together, break up your
fruits, chop it up, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of mash it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, this mash that you've just done,
you put it in the jar to ferment for about
[SPEAKER_01]: five to seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have liquid and solids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really undergoes a cool
fermentation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That amount of sugar is so that it doesn't
run away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you go to store it, so you
strain it off, your solids can be strained
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have your liquid left.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you used less sugar than one-to-one,
or if it seems like it's still really
[SPEAKER_01]: active when storing, you can add sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to kind of maximize the,
the, the sugar so that all the water
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules are kind of tied up and it stops
fermenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you have too much water,
it'll keep going into alcohol and we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want it to become a strong alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to kind of stay in that minor
fermentation that it did just in that five
[SPEAKER_01]: to seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that you can store with a
breathable lid at room temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: that keeps for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can keep for six months, really,
and be viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you use that on your farm at a rate of
one to 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're, when you're brewing up your
fermented fruit juice, you're using a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a permeable top on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just like the rest of these,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the cheesecloth or something,
because you're, you, you both want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the, the air exchange and you want to
invite air bound, you know, yeasts and
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with FFJ and FPGA, we expect that we
have a lot of our microbes already in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we want that, that
breathability, that, that gas exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll happen because the microbes
they'll be using oxygen and just like us,
[SPEAKER_01]: they breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things, you know,
the first time I tried to make this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I used store bought stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when, when fruits travel,
I mean, I used papaya cause that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature was saying, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the papaya has traveled a really long
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of ways they try to sterilize
it as much as they can for travel because
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want it to rot along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting a version of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not what the locals where it
was grown were eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a local friend of mine said,
you know, I explained to him my issue and
[SPEAKER_00]: why my first FFJ didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, just go glean off the trees,
you know, whatever, whatever's near your
[SPEAKER_00]: house, because it's, it's not like you
are, you're making this to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you necessarily need it to be
palatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need are the essential ingredients
of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so if you, you know, if you or your
neighbors got an old plum tree and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, just, just go glean off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if it's moving from ripe to
overripe, so long as it hasn't started
[SPEAKER_00]: producing alcohol, man, there's so much
biological activity in that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make a great FFJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we're seeing that we want to,
you know, the brewing part is easy and to
[SPEAKER_00]: get some local fruits that are,
that are, you know, we've got all of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the life stuff on the outside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then make sure that we add
enough sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was actually, I'm actually
surprised that, that it lasts as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: it is just at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually went through mine really fast
because I figured that fruit, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always think of fruit being unstable and
it's going to go to alcohol quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, but it seems like if you,
if you put enough sugar in, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to slow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at room temperature, like not on
top of the fridge, like kombucha,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll, it'll help it sleep even more.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the, the, the thing that's
actually causing it to be shelf stable is
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you add it, you know, two parts
water to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just dumped in a bunch of water,
that would go off like crazy and go from
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol to vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the, the sugar is dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually creates bonds with the water
molecules and the microbes that do
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation need water to do any of their
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by this, the specific balance of sugar
or by total saturation of sugar,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've actually trapped all your,
your water molecules in, in chemical bonds
[SPEAKER_01]: with sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and there's not a whole lot of water
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've created kind of a desert
environment for your microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they all are just kind of hanging
around waiting for you to reintroduce
[SPEAKER_01]: water, which you do when you add FPJ or
FFJ at a rate of one to 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes so much more sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so even though the essential
ingredients are there for it to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: on to alcohol, because the sugar is out of
balance with the water, the microbes don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the magic combination to continue
their party onto alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just hang out until you add them
to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do, you know, foliar or just
add it to your sip or whatever you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're going to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, they, there are minor alcohols
produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that initial fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a little bit, but yeah,
they can't continue and use all that sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't have the water needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next one, we're going to talk about
a fermented plant juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is nice because you can,
you know, you can wild craft, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants that you want to use pretty
much year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know, if you're, if you're
going to glean, you either need to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: during fruit season, or you need to get a
little more creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with rose hips or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, uh, why don't we do the same
process with fermented plant juice,
[SPEAKER_00]: please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fermented plant juice is really similar,
um, to fermented fruit juice, except you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't use multiple plants in one brew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if I'm going to use my FPJs and I want
to use my rhubarb FPJ, um, at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time, I use my dandelion FPJ, then I could
just add, you know, uh, half of each to
[SPEAKER_01]: make one to 500 and use it at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for storage, they stay separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the initial brew process,
they stay separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that's, that's specifically for,
for some of the, you know, one might have
[SPEAKER_01]: a much more delicate yeast and bacteria
makeup all over it that, um, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do its fermentation and process it than
another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I combine them for fermentation,
um, you're going to have, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the dominant one or the stronger one would
take over and, and you'd never even have a
[SPEAKER_01]: representation or very small of the,
you know, the less dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you really, you want to make
these separately, um, and store them
[SPEAKER_01]: separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, with FPJ, you can use all kinds
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used rhubarb here in Idaho, uh,
last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was tons of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted to, you know, bring in a new
person and make them taste our fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, they were kind of floored by
being able to drink this incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: tasting, uh, you know, ferment we're using
on plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so that was fun, but,
um, you can use anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're identifying as you look
for a plant for FPJ is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: always is thriving in your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to look for something that
nobody ever takes care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it always looks beautiful and green
and lush and the bugs don't even mess with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so find those plants, you know,
um, like where, where I live or,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh yeah, ice plants, a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, also where I live, we have tons of
horsetail, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first one I tried because
everyone said, oh, the silica in it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is really great for, uh, for building the
strength of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horsetail is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what are some other examples of,
of inputs like silica that we think about
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting in cannabis that we can get from
other wildcrafted plants, just,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to, so people can kind of get similar
on the idea of like, oh, if I want,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, phosphorus, I can use this
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's something that's kind of come
out of the kind of, um, general thoughts
[SPEAKER_01]: online that isn't straight out of natural
farming, um, from Korea, that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that's things that people have kind of
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, that's not
necessarily, that's not really something I
[SPEAKER_01]: would say is wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are really good thoughts,
but that's not out of the traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming kind of, um, process with,
if we wanted phosphorus or potassium or
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium, some of these things,
there's inputs for that water soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium WCA or water soluble calcium
phosphate WCAP or WCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so there are solutions for that
in the natural farming toolkit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I think that that, that idea of
horsetails is actually, uh, it's a great
[SPEAKER_01]: thought process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there's, there's more to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, um, we want the new growth of
some of these plants we're identifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that those growing tips, um,
is where a plant puts a ton of its energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of T cells and plant growth hormone
and all this stuff that, that we associate
[SPEAKER_01]: with, um, potential, um, energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's what plants kind of jams
all its energy into its new growth or its,
[SPEAKER_01]: its budding fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So green fruit is all, um, uh,
categorized as FPJ material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take, um, you know, half,
half formed apples or, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: green plums, um, that would be an FPJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you could take rhubarb stalks and
their leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take, um, ice plant or ivy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can take, or you could take grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you identify some vibrant grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make an FPJ out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so kind of sky's the limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dandelion, we use dandelion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use purslane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just totally kind of put, put my
approach to this on its head because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not actually looking for the specific
input.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I use the one of the silica
in the horse tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we want to get the microbial
level, you know, life force, one level of
[SPEAKER_00]: magnitude down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's pretty heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, and.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there's so little of this,
um, that we're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, it's a whole system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's not just like FPJ is the
one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: FPJ is a food for the plants and the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is, um, important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you are getting silica if you're using
horse tail, you know, that is part of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's, there's more to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's that whole system that you,
you're tending to the microbial life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in the soil on the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and yeah, so yeah, it isn't just
like identify a phosphorus rich plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he can, but, um, but you're missing
the bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're missing the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of, it's kind of a humility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're kind of like, okay, there's
actually some things in nature that are
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond the NPK and then the 23 minor
minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's something beyond this and
we're discovering that as we dig deeper
[SPEAKER_01]: and understanding phytonutrients and
these, you know, biochemicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're realizing this is actually more
complex than we thought it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to, and to steal the line from Jeff
Lohenfeld, this is like us teaming with
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is us saying, all right, we don't
necessarily understand the life force
[SPEAKER_00]: magic that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, inside of the new growth,
green, you know, the, the green new growth
[SPEAKER_00]: on the edge of the, on the tip of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but we know that if we take it and,
and if we fermented it a little bit to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage it, to make more of it,
whatever that, you know, unknown life
[SPEAKER_00]: force is becomes multiplied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our cannabis plants are fricking
stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and in the, in the process,
we're, we're kind of saying, and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: just trying to partner with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: With nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, we're just trying to take
something that's a vibrant and give it,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, into our commercial growing
system and, um, benefit from what nature
[SPEAKER_01]: is already doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to, uh, fish amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done this one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, just the, the fish aspect of it,
um, has, has, has caused me to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to hesitate a little bit, but,
um, but, but, but please, if you will
[SPEAKER_00]: explain, you know, what the, what the idea
behind this is and what the process looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, um, probably one of the best
nitrogen sources you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can get, um, for teaming with
microbial life and, uh, and using things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are really, um, micronized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of natural farming, these foliar
sprays and these inputs are highly
[SPEAKER_01]: available and micronization, micronization
is, uh, nutrients is, is really,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it's a word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thing where through fermentation
and the breakdown by microorganisms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: components in these things, we're getting
this, this, um, end product, this material
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually can be absorbed by the plant
itself, um, without the need for,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, so like if you apply chemical
fertilizer for that to ever be available
[SPEAKER_01]: to the plant, um, it actually has to be
processed by some microorganism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the people aquapon or
hydroponic farmers, they're always
[SPEAKER_01]: bleaching and then they put in their
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as they put in their nutrients
in the plant roots, they find that all the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant roots are colonized by bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, I just bleached.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is there this bacteria for them,
their plants, even to get access to these
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid fertilizers they're putting in,
they need those bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, for, for us, fish amino acid
is, this is really amazing fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's fish hydrolysis and,
uh, fish emulsions that you can buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of those are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think hydrolysis is a little better than
emulsion, but really, uh, a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things, they're, they're taking off the
fats for a fish oil product on the side,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so they're double dipping in in
kind of, um, productivity or, or
[SPEAKER_01]: profitability of their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're, or they're taking off some
other byproduct of the fish and using it
[SPEAKER_01]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not getting the whole suite of
what, um, uh, you know, like a fish has to
[SPEAKER_01]: offer, whereas this fish amino acid,
this fermented whole fish or, or fish
[SPEAKER_01]: waste is, um, the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's being highly micronized by,
instead of us cooking it or, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing these other processes, it's being
fermented.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the breakdown is happening by
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it's, it's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your plants, if you actually make this
in the way that, um, it's supposed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: made, your plants really react.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about how it's supposed to
be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you really need to use the blue,
uh, blue backed fish as it says in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, the, the, the, you know,
the, the original treatise or can you use,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you use whatever you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something special about blue
backed fish?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, that blue backed fish for,
for the sake of kind of translating that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, culturally and language, it's deep
water fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they, they've taken on, uh,
a different level of, um, or a different
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of the kind of minerals of the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So farm raised fish or pond fish or river
fish aren't going to have quite the same
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of mineral, um, tied up in their
systems as deep water fish are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting this kind of,
um, complexity of nutrition, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: for your plants that a deep water fish has
maybe more than a river fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's kind of what that's
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so can, can I use what fish I save?
[SPEAKER_01]: Say all I have is steelhead or,
or, uh, tilapia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, can I use that and get a fish
fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is, there is something to this
deep water fish being recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, just knowing that, okay,
I don't have the best source, but I have
[SPEAKER_01]: this tilapia.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I have available.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cheap and, and accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just know that there, there might be
some benefit if you could get,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that stuff coming off the
fishing vessels down at the Harbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you, you might get some additional
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's, that's why that's
recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: So up to you, you gotta, ultimately you're
king on your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to make the decisions you want to
make and you can, you can do parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the year, the natural farming has
been thought out very thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, every time I dig into the
science, um, I find it, um, founded in
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really good scientific thought and
theory and, and, um, truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say, okay, so I've either,
I've either gone down to the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the Harbor and, and bought a,
you know, a tuner or something off a boat,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, or, or more realistically,
the first time I try this, I'm probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use something, you know,
less expensive, like tilapia or sardines,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that if I screw it up,
you know, I won't feel as quite so bad
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so now that I have my fish,
how do you go about in stacking this
[SPEAKER_00]: ferment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me clarify real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go down and buy a fresh tuna office
off the fish, make sure you get the filets
[SPEAKER_01]: off, make yourself some sashimi and enjoy
that with your friends and only use the
[SPEAKER_01]: bones, the guts and the head for,
um, or, or the carcass, the guts in the
[SPEAKER_01]: head for this fish amino acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let me hear of anybody wasting a
perfectly good tune.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, on fertilizer for, uh, yeah,
that, that would just be a tragedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking that it sounded really
expensive to use a whole deep water fish,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, but with that, with that addition,
what actually might make a lot more sense
[SPEAKER_00]: is to just go to your, your, your local,
um, you know, Japanese market where they
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare and clean the fish and just ask
them, say, Hey, can I come back at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm sure they'd be thrilled to give
it to you, especially if you say you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something like exotic like this and
be like, Oh yeah, we'll hook you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, don't, don't confuse this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is supposed to be the, the waste
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and a lot of times people are cooking
with the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might not even get the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might only get the carcass and the
gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some Asian cultures, you're not even
getting that they're gonna, they're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: cook with all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah, I actually just recently
for the class I taught last November and
[SPEAKER_01]: Boise, I, uh, I just asked our local,
uh, sushi, um, shop if, uh, if they had
[SPEAKER_01]: any, uh, fish heads, they got all their
tuna came pre-fileted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't get any tuna, but I got all
their salmon heads and carcasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave them a cooler of those to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm, I have fish amino acid brewing
in my office that doesn't smell at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and I share that, that office,
I have two offices where I work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that office is shared with like six
other people and, uh, nobody even knows
[SPEAKER_01]: it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's basically rotting fish,
but it's not rotting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's aerobically fermenting fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, here's the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so you take your fish waste as we've
established, not, not the filets,
[SPEAKER_01]: eat those fish waste, equal weight,
brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sensing the theme here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Equal weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a dash of IMO four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am very intentionally not giving you
a specific measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to have a super specific
measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a light inoculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a handful of IMO four,
um, for that fermentation, that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: really skewing your, your microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For folks who don't know what IMO four is,
will you, will you briefly hit that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's, I've taken microbes out
of my local forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've multiplied them out on substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a, it's a four step process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the number four just refers to,
it's the fourth stage in the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: taking it out of the forest and getting it
ready for my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's just, uh, indigenous inoculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could take a handful of leaf litter
out of your local forest if you didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have IMO four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so a handful of inoculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's leaf litter out of your
forest or IMO four, IMO four is ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then just a little bit of,
um, just a splash of OHN.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have it, OHN is another natural
farming ferment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a YouTube video on how to make it,
um, Oriental herbal nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, don't worry about those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have those, you could still
make this, but I would recommend going out
[SPEAKER_01]: to the forest and getting some visible
spider webby mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a handful and throwing it in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't have that, you can still
make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, the basic process is equal
weights, brown sugar, and, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: put it in a cooler and leave it to ferment
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The absolute earliest you would want to
extract that in the natural farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, recipe would be three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And truthfully, that's too soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: So best is a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just throw it in a cooler,
you can put a lid on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't, you want to, whatever you do,
you want to set it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rats or some rodent can't get in and
ruin all your hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but what I'll usually do is stick a
mesh over it and throw a lid on it
[SPEAKER_01]: loosely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no rodents can get in a little bit,
a little bit of air can transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, airflow is positive, but sometimes
it's hard to find a container where it can
[SPEAKER_01]: both breathe and be closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and protected, but yeah, then you
leave it for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you'll have is you'll have just the
bones left over and you'll have this like
[SPEAKER_01]: blackish liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be straight liquid fish and,
uh, it, it smells and tastes like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, fish sauce that you buy at the store
for cooking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's really, it's really a positive
smell and taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yes, I've tasted my fish amino acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I've made it with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh tuna off the coast of Hawaii and
brown sugar and a handful of IMO four that
[SPEAKER_01]: I made myself and kept it nice and clean
and a, and a fresh, uh, cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and then it came off and it's
just a beautiful, if you can make food
[SPEAKER_01]: with it, you know, this could be instead
of making plant fertilizer, you just made
[SPEAKER_01]: fish sauce for cooking, but really it is,
um, it's great cheap fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you know if it goes bad,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, like if, like if it starts to
smell, is that a good, um, a good
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestion that something went wrong along
the process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do it, if you do it according to
this recipe, it really doesn't go bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if you didn't have an inoculum,
um, you could have a, a month period where
[SPEAKER_01]: it smelled kind of foul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that also probably means there was
something wrong with your ratio of fish to
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if you find, if it seems like there's
way too much liquid, you may need to add a
[SPEAKER_01]: little extra sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if it, you know, that's anyway,
you don't worry about that, but really it
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, something's probably gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if you can get just even a handful
of soil from a wild environment could,
[SPEAKER_01]: could be all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need some kind of inoculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is clearly the, uh,
the longest, uh, uh, segment of shaping
[SPEAKER_00]: fire that we've ever done here at 50
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our second,
uh, break and we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is Korean natural
farming educator, Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I certainly still enjoy smoking
joints, I moved over to using vaporizers
[SPEAKER_00]: about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high was a little different than
burning the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, I decided I preferred it
for daily use, especially because I have
[SPEAKER_00]: asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, though, I could taste my
flower so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to express to you how
significantly different cannabis with a
[SPEAKER_00]: good terpene profile tastes when vaped
instead of burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have brought my vape with me to visit
growers and they are astonished by the
[SPEAKER_00]: clarity of taste and they say they feel
like they're tasting their flower for the
[SPEAKER_00]: very first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air vape vaporizer from airvapeusa.com
is a great device to use on the go or at
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pick it up, it feels satisfying
like a medical device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't flimsy like many vapes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how the flower is inserted in the
top instead of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So travels a shorter path to my mouth with
the cannabis at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a hit that feels more substantial,
even though I'm just inhaling vapor and
[SPEAKER_00]: not full bodied smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I use this vape for flower,
hash, and concentrates, I really like that
[SPEAKER_00]: the digital control for the temperature is
right there on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three clicks of the button and it fires up
to the temperature I specify really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vape concentrates are a milder experience
than dabbing, but you still get the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency in your hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the taste is great, as would be
expected with a low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that this vape gives quick little
vibrations when it gets to the right
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if I'm chatting or distracted
while it's heating up, it lets me know
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are ready for a nice pocket-sized
vaporizer, consider the Airvape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new Airvape X has just come out and
it's gorgeous and includes many updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find more about the Airvape
vaporizer at airvapeusa.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow cannabis with sunshine,
you can often feel limited by the seasonal
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grow sustainably and save
money, so you use as little electricity as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you haven't studied or implemented
light deprivation techniques into your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, you're leaving a lot of money
on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: By incorporating light deprivation
solutions into your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can often add two or three additional
growing cycles to your year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pencil out the financial benefit
of those additional cycles, you'll realize
[SPEAKER_00]: why commercial-scale light deprivation
technology is remaking the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What used to be done by pulling tarps over
hoop houses has been scaled up over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few years in such a way that it's
become mechanized, easy, and affordable to
[SPEAKER_00]: even small-scale commercial cannabis
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever Flowering Greenhouses is the
industry leader in light deprivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse design and operation for the
commercial cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their team of greenhouse experts have been
in the fields of Northern California for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades, and they're now building
greenhouses for commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are new to light dep and growing in
greenhouses, I encourage you to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire Episode 13 with guest Eric
Branstad of Forever Flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk with Eric about the importance of
intelligent greenhouse management as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as the huge financial benefit of
incorporating light dep techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many aspects of utilizing a
greenhouse that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: From temperature and airflow to light dep
and workflow, Forever Flowering will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you produce crop after crop of
well-cared-for flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help you retrofit your existing
greenhouse with light dep and other modern
[SPEAKER_00]: systems at a level that fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just starting out, Forever
Flowering can help you plan and build your
[SPEAKER_00]: new greenhouse so that you get started on
the right foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis business has enough risks
without trying to go it alone with your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact Forever Flowering Greenhouses to
partner with folks who have an
[SPEAKER_00]: indisputable reputation as knowledgeable
and easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash FFG to
find out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is Chris Trump,
Korean natural farming educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're still with us after the
second set, I appreciate you staying with
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are either here for Chris Trump and
you're not a regular listener,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you are a regular listener,
you just totally got indoctrinated into
[SPEAKER_00]: Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on this last set, we're going to
talk about a couple different topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one we're going to start out
with is one of my favorites since I live
[SPEAKER_00]: on an island here, and that's fermented
seawater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, Chris, when I first
read this, I thought it was a typo or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we go about fermenting seawater?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool because it's kind of
philosophically in natural farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: the concept is we rose out of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ocean is the mother of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have all the ocean,
you know, mineral components and soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: human blood is very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually plant blood, quote unquote,
or cytoplasm is very similar to seawater
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually plant, quote, blood is very
similar to seawater, diluted seawater.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's diluted at a rate of one to 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in natural farming, you'll see
seawater is used at a dilution rate of one
[SPEAKER_01]: to 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically you're using something very
similar to plant blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're at the hospital,
we maybe got dehydrated or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're getting an IV of saline because it
helps us process stress or dehydration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really actually a quite
similar concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fermented seawater is giving some microbes
access to all those great minor minerals
[SPEAKER_01]: in seawater along with some plant
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fermented seawater is ocean water one
to 30, LAB one to 700, and I think FPJ one
[SPEAKER_01]: to 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's fermented for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ferment it longer or store it in a
vessel and it can just kind of stay
[SPEAKER_01]: fermented seawater.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're raising animals and you want
to kind of cheaply better your pasture
[SPEAKER_01]: land is a great, great thing to spray on
grassland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also just something you can spray on
your crops somewhat regularly,
[SPEAKER_01]: weekly or every other week with a great
result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, almost no cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ratios that you give for the
inputs, those ratios are all to fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that with most of these
things, we want to use rainwater is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably best or perhaps RO, but we want
to stay away from our chlorinated tap
[SPEAKER_00]: water, I would assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to stay away from chlorinated
tap water, RO is actually really a vacuum,
[SPEAKER_01]: minerally speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like distilled water and RO are
fairly similar and you want to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be kind of shocking to plants
actually, because it's so such a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can suck stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water is so readily bonded to so many
things that it actually can pass through
[SPEAKER_01]: your system and draw mineral rather than,
and that can have consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make it in this, you put it
together, fresh water with the salt water,
[SPEAKER_00]: the FPJ and what was the third ingredient?
[SPEAKER_01]: LAB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the LAB.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, the LAB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how long do you let it ferment?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know when you're ready to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, LAB is that thing we make with
the rice wash and the milk and that serum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's your fermenter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant juice is kind of like a
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this came over hundreds of years of
observation of different things that
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers did, where basically they found
that if they took these minor minerals and
[SPEAKER_01]: some plant component through fermentation,
the leftover liquid did gangbuster cool
[SPEAKER_01]: things to crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was often done accidentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in Korea, they make kimchi and the
kimchi water dumped out all their plants
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever they dumped their kimchi water
went ballistic and were the tastiest and
[SPEAKER_01]: sweetest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they found that that mineral,
that minor mineral allows plants to do
[SPEAKER_01]: complex sugar making, which we associate
with flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing, not only does the sea
water have all of those, those micro
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals, but it also has got entirely
different communities of microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, and you feed those guys
some, some FPGA and wait, which do you say
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented fruit juice or the plant juice
goes into this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant juice.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you give them that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you they would multiply super fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those landlocked people,
if you don't have ocean water or you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to drive eight hours to get some,
and that's just not realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get some sea salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And put it into water at a rate of 30
grams per liter to make the basically that
[SPEAKER_01]: sea water, 30 grams to one liter of fresh
water is now you have a bottle of sea
[SPEAKER_01]: water, and then you can dilute that one to
30.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you wanted to skip the dilution
step, you could put one gram per one
[SPEAKER_01]: liter, and then you have a dilution of one
to 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's a great excuse to go on a beach
vacation and just bring, bring back water
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do it fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm sure that those microbes don't
like to hang out in containers very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know, sea water keeps really
nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in landlocked places in Korea,
they actually go and they'll get a tanker
[SPEAKER_01]: and they fill these.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have these underground storage vats
and they just fill these big old vats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as they need it, they pull it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about water soluble
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we talked about that a little bit
earlier when, when you redirect me about
[SPEAKER_00]: the silica that I, from the horse tail I
was using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, you alluded to that, you know,
there's actually something in Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming for these, these minerals
in case you want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: turn, if you've got to turn up your
calcium, if you've got to turn up your
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you break down what water
soluble minerals are in KNF?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's, there's a lot of,
there's a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and some of them are with,
with acid and raw rock and that's some,
[SPEAKER_01]: some proprietary things that master Cho
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that knowledge will kind of trickle
out over the next several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but the, the basics and that are
really important are water soluble calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of your phosphorus,
water soluble calcium, and then water
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble potassium WSK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are WCA is the calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: WCP is sometimes used or WCAP for calcium
phosphate and then WSK for potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I just rattled those off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to create them, I have some
videos on phosphorus and calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check out on YouTube, but the
basic recipe is that you take eggshells,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you had access to coral sand,
you could use that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eggshells, you heat them in a pan
until they kind of cook past those,
[SPEAKER_01]: the organic matter kind of chars off and
you have just kind of the, the calcium of
[SPEAKER_01]: eggshells.
[SPEAKER_01]: You throw them in brown rice vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have this highly basic
material, this calcium rich material,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you throw it in an acid and you get a
chemical reaction where the acid yanks out
[SPEAKER_01]: all this calcium and you take calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have calcium in solution or
micronized through that chemical process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a water soluble calcium highly
plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use that as a rate of one to a
thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for phosphorus, we take bones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any old butcher bones or whatever you
have, you could even go out to a ranch and
[SPEAKER_01]: get, you know, sun bleached bones out on
the range and take them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You throw them on the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You char them basically like you want to
make biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a biochar process already,
that's great, but you char them so they're
[SPEAKER_01]: past the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've kind of, you've kind of charred off
all the organic matter and they're down to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of their mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're, they're kind of a solid
black, even some, some white on the edges
[SPEAKER_01]: turning the ash is, isn't terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's all white, it's gone to ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get it kind of at the point
where it's even if it's on the ash,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's some white, but it's,
you don't want it to be brown where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: still got a bunch of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have, I showed that in the video,
but it's, it's down to it's mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you throw that in a brown rice
vinegar and it reacts and yanks out all
[SPEAKER_01]: that mineral and puts it into solution and
you can spray that foliarly and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: highly plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that helps you at these specific stages
in plant development.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in vegetative growth,
you're going to want that calcium kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of banging in there and more so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in that changeover as it goes,
just before it goes into flowering in
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming, we encourage the use of
the water soluble calcium phosphate and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then some more as it makes,
makes its fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: For folks who have never done a biochar
and the idea of, of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you charring this stuff is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long would you say, and I haven't
actually done bone, you know, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to say, take a, take a small amount
of bones and put it in a, like an old
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee can or something and, and,
and then cover it with foil and you put it
[SPEAKER_00]: on the grill or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long would you say that it would take
for bone to reach this mineral state we're
[SPEAKER_00]: shooting for?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really going to depend on
what your setup is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just doing it on an open grill
with an open fire, you can kind of watch
[SPEAKER_01]: it change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be a way to do it initially,
but it kind of, if you're doing some kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of enclosed thing, it's going to depend on
your heat of your fire and how you set it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the grill open flame, it takes
probably 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just turning it with some
barbecue tongs or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I was going for is I,
I just wanted to hear that 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people understood this is not like a
five hour thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually, even though we made it
sound a little more exotic, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the bones, it's, it's actually,
you know, not, not all that hard to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have the bones, I mean,
clearly the, the eggshells are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so to, to finish off this video,
the show, Chris, I want to reward all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hardcore Korean natural farming folks
who, who not only recommended you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: show, but also were like cheering me on
for having you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, you're, you are,
you were certainly a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you'd refer to yourself as a
celebrity, but I can refer to you as a
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrity in KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I want to invite you to go over my
head, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I only know what to ask you based on the,
the little bit I've learned so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the, you know, the questions that
people suggested me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I'd like you to go over my head
and, and talk about something that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're excited about right now that
will be, you know, a nice reward to the
[SPEAKER_00]: KNF people who, who stayed with us
throughout the show and we're waiting for
[SPEAKER_00]: you to like drop something, you know,
heavy over my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so please, if you would,
you know, what, what have you been excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about recently that you, that you want to
share?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's, you know, this,
this journey in KNF is, it's, it's deep
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's really a pursuit of
understanding and partnering with nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: which it's, the interconnectivity is mind
boggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And science is just kind of beginning to
scratch the surface of how things are
[SPEAKER_01]: interconnected.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'm really enjoying,
something I'm kind of pursuing and playing
[SPEAKER_01]: with is substrates for growing out IMO and
some of the best media for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found over the years is that
there's, there's things that certain
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes like better to chew on than other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in Korea, they use a rice bran to
grow, to do this IMO one through our IMO
[SPEAKER_01]: three and four process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rice bran is rich in fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the US, they started doing mill run
because it was the kind of comparable
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that was cheap and readily
available, like a, a agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: byproduct that was readily available.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we've looked at it, mill run is way
lower in fat content than a rice bran.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as fungal foods specifically,
fungi love fats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the cell wall of a plant is full
of fats.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's these, these complex and tied up fat
chains, but, but cell walls are full of
[SPEAKER_01]: them in like in plant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that silica, you know, people are like,
oh, silica is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why does silica, why is there so
much and, and microbes that, that smaller,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, bacteria is really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's buying these bacillus and
stuff, but these, these fungi,
[SPEAKER_01]: these, these microbes that tend to have
relationship with plants in a unique way
[SPEAKER_01]: and their root structure really require
some of these, I'm saying fats,
[SPEAKER_01]: but these lipids and these, these things
that we, you know, like silica where,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's this kind of these complex
chains that are created and fungi get in
[SPEAKER_01]: and they break apart these, these fatty
acid chains and they use the acids and
[SPEAKER_01]: the, and the lipids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I've found is that the,
this, the substrates are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Hawaii, I switched from using like
messing around with mill run and I used a
[SPEAKER_01]: byproduct from our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was kind of off-grade macadamia
nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I combined that with carbon like a
macadamia shell or wood chip or sawdust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found incredible fungal growth and
diversity could be fostered in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in that kind of a substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, I'd encourage you if you can
find rice bran or some of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: grains that have their own decent fat
profile, that might be cool to bring into
[SPEAKER_01]: your, your material as you make your IMO
three as a food for your, your bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms, like a large hypodiameter
fungi, you know, because they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are really important in the whole
process of cultivating a soil food web in
[SPEAKER_01]: your, in your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it makes sense too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because mill run is going to be so
processed and, and, and the, and the rice,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's, it's got the full fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make sense that that would be
more of what nature wants to respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of a thinned out processed
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun journey just to kind of,
you know, see how we can cultivate what
[SPEAKER_01]: nature already does.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Chris, thank you so much for coming
on the show, especially for such a long
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and not only, you know,
teaching us and sharing your experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, you've been at this for a
lot of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for you to be able to, you know,
capsulize it and give it context really
[SPEAKER_00]: allows the rest of us who are new to this
to, to jump in the deep end of the pool a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you enjoyed this episode,
be sure to follow Chris's YouTube channel
[SPEAKER_00]: and it doesn't have a forward slash.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need to do though is to just
search, uh, Chris Trump and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: K and F or actually I got it just by
putting in Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can follow his Instagram,
which, you know, is a mix of both growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's at Ford slash soil steward on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's got a new website up that is just
being filled out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably going to be better,
you know, in a month or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, but that, you know, book market
for now, that's at natural farming.co is
[SPEAKER_00]: his website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also, uh, Chris has got a class coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can find it on Eventbrite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, it's coming up in July of 2018
and it's in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you, if you, if you were
thinking you had to fly to Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do not have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, so you can search that on
Eventbrite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I want to remind you again to
check out, uh, both the Korean natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming group on Facebook and also,
uh, the probiotic farmers Alliance group
[SPEAKER_00]: also on Facebook.
