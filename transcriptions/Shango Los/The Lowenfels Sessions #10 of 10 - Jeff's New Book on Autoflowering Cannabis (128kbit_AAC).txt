[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was really surprised and some,
like me, pleasantly when we found out that
[SPEAKER_01]: your new book was not going to be another
soil science book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we all love the original trilogy,
and we were all waiting for something new
[SPEAKER_01]: from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you tell me at Emerald Cup,
ah, the new book is AutoFlower,
[SPEAKER_01]: which caused me to decide that I wanted to
do this whole year of AutoFlower
[SPEAKER_01]: programming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for you, what inspired you to change
to choose AutoFlower and cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_01]: as your new topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: And would you share with us a bit about
your new book?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I am oriented towards the
science stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, as I was thinking last night,
I think I have another one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: coming, but in the back of my mind,
I see some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one was totally out of the blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, writing a book is a painful
experience for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And although I love doing it, and I'm
happy that I do it, and it's what I love
[SPEAKER_02]: to do, it's painful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go into a rabbit hole and stay
down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to organize everything in
that rabbit hole so nobody will touch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you have to come up for
supper with the wife, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got to get out of that rabbit hole
all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't want to, because you forget
when you put stuff in everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I swore to myself I would never write
another book again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that painful experience, even though
I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my wife was gone, and I was tending
some AutoFlowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said to myself, you know,
this is the next tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to write the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sat down, and in a week,
while she was gone, because that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: only way I could really do it,
I wrote a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it wasn't the best thing in the
world, but I got, she had this enough here
[SPEAKER_02]: for a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this might work, and I really
think we need to spread the word about
[SPEAKER_02]: these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that as I wrote it,
it wasn't a book that I was writing for
[SPEAKER_02]: you, or myself even.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was writing this book for people like my
mother, who grow tomatoes and would love
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea of a brand new plant that they'd
never heard of before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck, commercial growers have never,
I'm so surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reaction is something we ought to talk
about as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a plant that, nobody's heard of
before, brand new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same size as a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows during the same season as a
tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also grow it indoors like a tomato
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you take care of it exactly
like a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to share like a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, share like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has trichomes like a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything you know about tomatoes
applies to this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple things you have to learn,
different flowers, obviously two different
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of flowers, as opposed to a tomato,
and you have to learn how to handle that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But wow, this is a plant that anybody can
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the book really evolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a lot of history in it of where
cannabis came from, to explain land races,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think people need to understand,
because we're going back, getting some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that genetics into the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Explain the chemistry of the cannabinoid
system a little teeny bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Explain that it's not sativa, you know,
sativa indica anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all of the flavonoids and
cannabinoids and all that great stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about the namings of this stuff,
how it all got to be where it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: and certainly how to grow this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then where's it going in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think there is a spectacular
future with this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do believe that once the stigma
goes away for cannabis, and it is
[SPEAKER_02]: disappearing quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read today that all but three stigmas in
the United States have something to do
[SPEAKER_02]: with legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: All but three, how did they?
[SPEAKER_01]: In such a short period.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stigma aside, you said earlier in
your answer, you said there's something
[SPEAKER_01]: worth to be said about the reaction of
professional ornamental growers to the
[SPEAKER_01]: arrival of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all of a sudden, even the nurseries
that grow begonias are beginning to think,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, we don't have a license or
anything else, but if this is a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: people can grow at home, we should be
selling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, lots of places, I'm not even sure in
Washington state you're allowed to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a while, I don't think you were
allowed to grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you still can't grow them in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I know in New York state they're
talking about legislation where they're
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about banning the growing of
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a plant, for goodness sake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think this book is going to,
first of all, a lot of people who've never
[SPEAKER_02]: heard of this plant, they're waking up,
even commercial growers of cannabis have
[SPEAKER_02]: never heard of an auto flowering cannabis
that's any good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think once people start to see that this
is a regular plant, the stigma starts to
[SPEAKER_02]: fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gee, it is just like a tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't limit people growing tomato
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we limiting?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean I'm not allowed to grow
this plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can buy it at a store, but I'm not
allowed to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how long are that stuff's going to
change?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is the thing that's going to
stimulate it, this auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anything that we can do to
normalize, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that for auto flowers,
a lot of folks, just like early feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you don't want to use feminized
seeds to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're for particular types of growing
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think auto flowers the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the early stuff was a little
sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the new wave of auto flowers are just
like, out of this world.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are out of this world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gotten to the point where you
want the seeds, because it's that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, I can make this even better by
breeding it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think we'll find a lot of it that
will not be feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed that a lot of the companies
are selling non-feminized auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: which again, this is so much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you think about it, you get your
tomato plant, you look at it at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the season, you go, boy, this was a really
good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to save the seeds for this
particular one and put it early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever it may taste different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might breed it with another one,
just take your little brush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so easy to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the same kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think people who are into gardening,
they don't want to just stick something in
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground that they buy at a nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to start it from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, you're not a real gardener
unless you start something from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to start it from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to play with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is their hobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is a hobby plant, if we ever
saw one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that because we've grown the
bigger kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little kinds are every bit as much of
a hobby, even more so because they grow so
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a particular kind of disease,
someone says, gee, why don't you try this
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow it, you improve it, you grow in
your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Truly, it's seven, eight, nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I wrote the book,
because I think everyday gardeners are
[SPEAKER_02]: really going to get into this plant,
not for the THC, not for the CB,
[SPEAKER_02]: just because it's a fun plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then within that, you find the parts
you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the book comes out in October this
year, 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pre-order it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the link to it on Amazon is in the
first description.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jeff, thank you so much for taking the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those songs with singers and everything
else, and they compete, and they give that
[SPEAKER_02]: little announcement in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy goes, go for number two.
Buy the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't forget the other ones either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you pick up the trilogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The links to the trilogy is in the soil
science trilogy, or in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: description as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for taking all this time to do
this shaping fire session with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge fan, and it's great to have you
live this time with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm a fan of yours, and I thank you
for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
