[SPEAKER_08]: All right, folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to put your cell phones on
vibrate and have a seat, we're going to
[SPEAKER_08]: get going.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome, everybody, to the 2 o'clock
panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are looking at the program,
I want to make sure you know that this is
[SPEAKER_08]: not Maryland Accultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually designing and marketing
cannabis-infused products.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully, you are in the right place.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am your host for the panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am also the host of the Shaping Fire
podcast, Shane Delos.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you enjoy listening to experts at the
top of the cannabis field talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: their discipline, I encourage you to pick
up a postcard near the door and take a
[SPEAKER_08]: listen to my show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to invite you all to a party
tonight that is being thrown by Dope
[SPEAKER_08]: Magazine.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have reserved the roof at the
Clarendon Hotel and are having a big old
[SPEAKER_08]: throwdown.
[SPEAKER_08]: So everyone is invited.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our panel today will go through about 40
minutes, and then there will be some time
[SPEAKER_08]: at the end for questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you think of a question during the
panel, make sure you write it down so that
[SPEAKER_08]: you don't forget.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, if you want to show this panel
to friends, partners, and loved ones,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can feel free to find the recording of
this panel on my YouTube channel at
[SPEAKER_08]: shangolos.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: So first, let's welcome our guests.
[SPEAKER_08]: From the far side, we've got Trista Ocow
from Empower Oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the middle is Nancy Whiteman from Juana
Brands.
[SPEAKER_08]: And right next to me, we've got Jane Fix
from Monarch Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: So welcome to all of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are merely highlights of each
speaker's bio.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are all very accomplished
professionals.
[SPEAKER_08]: But just to give you an idea of who we
have with us today,
[SPEAKER_08]: Trista on the far end is founder of
Empower Body Care, named one of the
[SPEAKER_08]: country's top 10 cannabis companies by
High Times Magazine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Empower Body Care provides both hemp and
cannabis infused healing topical products,
[SPEAKER_08]: and has won an array of local and national
product awards.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the middle, Nancy is co-founder and
co-owner of Juana Brands, which produces
[SPEAKER_08]: Juana Edibles, Juana Extracts,
and Juana Medicinals.
[SPEAKER_08]: Juana Brands is Colorado's number one
edibles producer by revenue, and now has
[SPEAKER_08]: expanded into Oregon, Nevada, and soon
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Nancy is responsible for the
partnerships and the licensing agreements
[SPEAKER_08]: domestically and internationally.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's got an MBA from University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, and is on the
[SPEAKER_08]: board of the Cannabis Business Alliance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jane Fix is head of patient services for
Monarch Wellness Center right here in
[SPEAKER_08]: Scottsdale, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_08]: Monarch is the provider of Kiva products
throughout the state, and Jane has
[SPEAKER_08]: extraordinary experience with
understanding patient needs and reducing
[SPEAKER_08]: suffering using cannabis edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm very happy to have such an
experience panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: How we're going to do this is I've got a
series of questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to start at one end and then
the other, and then hopefully enlist in a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit of conversation throughout.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's get going.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's start with you here, Jane,
and then we'll work our way down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I guess I also want to point out that
the topic is kind of general with
[SPEAKER_08]: designing and marketing of cannabis
infused products.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll notice a little bit of the
difference in the answers because Jane and
[SPEAKER_08]: Nancy are both, while they both are
familiar with topicals, their expertise is
[SPEAKER_08]: in edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Interest on the end is more about
topicals.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to get a little creative on
how we work the questions, but you'll
[SPEAKER_08]: understand a play along.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Jane, patients require a wide range of
doses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some as little as two and a half
milligrams, and others up to and over 100
[SPEAKER_08]: milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even more before considering the CBD
component.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, from the headspace of a
product designer, when designing a limited
[SPEAKER_08]: range of products that are going to be
going to market for public sale,
[SPEAKER_08]: what do you think are the best default
setting dosages to bring to market for
[SPEAKER_08]: patients?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our product started at five milligrams
dose, and our highest dosage is 180
[SPEAKER_04]: milligrams chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I often say to people, if they come in
and say, oh, the chocolate bar just didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: do it right, I say 180 milligrams
chocolate bar should have an effect on
[SPEAKER_04]: mental health.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have bigger problems than the
milligrams do for your digestive system.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, unless the patient is 104,
and I do have a before-go patient,
[SPEAKER_04]: I generally start at five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I go as low as 2.5.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I medicate the patient at night
for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I medicate the patient at night
for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to reorient you, the question is,
when designing products for the market
[SPEAKER_08]: specifically, because patients need such a
wide range, how do you know what
[SPEAKER_08]: milligrams to bring to the market that's
going to be effective for the most amount
[SPEAKER_08]: of people?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have two options with the Kiva
confections.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a five milligram option here,
and down the road, potentially a 2.5
[SPEAKER_04]: milligram option.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are for the newbies, the people
coming in as a recreational user retention
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have your candy bars that you
can divide up into what you know is your
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So me, for example, when I get my Kiva
confections, it's in 45 milligram squares,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I cut those squares into thirds,
because 15 milligrams is my sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have it ready to roll, and I can just
put it in my little bag and get my Kiva
[SPEAKER_04]: confections.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sounds like your answer is on
subdividable milligrams in whatever the
[SPEAKER_08]: product is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is sort of an interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's sort of a two-parter embedded in
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: One is the dosage of the indivisible.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in Colorado, we are mandated by law on
the adult use side of the market to have a
[SPEAKER_07]: maximum of 100-milligram products on the
right side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have to be delineated into no
more than 10-milligram units.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that part of it is set in stone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Medical has more flexibility.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, we have chosen to have a range of
dosages.
[SPEAKER_07]: Within our individual products,
and we have a line of gummies and hard
[SPEAKER_07]: lozenges and caramels and other
confectionary products.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an option.
[SPEAKER_07]: The real answer, Shango, is that nobody
really truly knows what is the most
[SPEAKER_07]: effective dose, because there's so many
variables to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's individual metabolism.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the condition that's being
treated.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's how the body processes.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: So our philosophy is to provide people
with a range of options so that they can
[SPEAKER_07]: experiment and see what works for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we currently have products that are
delineated into five, 10, and 20-milligram
[SPEAKER_07]: dosages.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're about to come out with a
microdose of 2.5.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think our basic philosophy and what
we help promote in the industry is start
[SPEAKER_07]: low and go slow, particularly for people
who are new to cannabis and new to
[SPEAKER_07]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: The last thing in the world that we want
is for somebody to have an uncomfortable
[SPEAKER_07]: experience with edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we spent a lot of time out in the
field talking with bud tenders about
[SPEAKER_07]: edible metabolism, how people experience
them, and how they should be working with
[SPEAKER_07]: their patients and their customers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because Colorado is an adult-use
state, we're particularly sensitive to
[SPEAKER_07]: tourists and newbies who really haven't
tried edibles before, and always really
[SPEAKER_07]: encouraging people to start low and get
used to what their body can tolerate
[SPEAKER_07]: before downing 180-milligram dosages.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of our philosophy on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so the beauty of topicals is that
they are non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_06]: So since 2005, I've been working on
different formulations and seeing what
[SPEAKER_06]: works best.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like to go under 0.5% by volume
per unit for topicals in either CBD or
[SPEAKER_06]: THC-A, because that seems to be the sweet
spot, the most effective dosage.
[SPEAKER_06]: That said, I would also like to weigh in
on the edibles, because I love the
[SPEAKER_06]: starting at 2.5 to 5, and going from
there, I think it's right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting, because when it comes to
edibles, there seems to be a lot of need
[SPEAKER_08]: for variety up to around 25 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_08]: People's sweet spot, they might be at 2.5,
and it might be at 15.
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes it's different depending on
who they're purchasing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of difference in need up
to 25.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if somebody needs above 25 milligrams,
chances are likely that they are needing
[SPEAKER_08]: to take so much THC to deal with the
chronic pain, or whatever their issue is,
[SPEAKER_08]: that they're probably gaining tolerance so
fast that they're going to really need to
[SPEAKER_08]: hit it hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so these are the people who take
100-milligram bar and break it in half,
[SPEAKER_08]: and have half now and half later.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as far as a product designer goes,
it sounds like half having a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: variety at the low end, and then going
slow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why didn't you say that was great?
[SPEAKER_08]: Start low and go slow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now we're going to start on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this one's for you, Trista.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as far as infused topicals go,
cannabis topicals have become very popular
[SPEAKER_08]: for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a lot of debate with product
designers about what the best carrier oils
[SPEAKER_08]: are, because some are seeking to be on top
of the derma for something like psoriasis
[SPEAKER_08]: and eczema.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas others are selling for pain
relief, and so you have to break through
[SPEAKER_08]: the derma.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to hear from you what your
thoughts are on carrier oils for both of
[SPEAKER_08]: those applications, and then we'll come in
this direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I personally like to use Ovovoil,
49-chromovoil, because it's the most like
[SPEAKER_06]: our own skin sealant or skin oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: It absorbs faster and better than any
other oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, you cannot infuse it in Ovo.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to choose a different carrier
oil to infuse it to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of people like to use coconut oil,
grapeseed oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard avocado oil, but personally my
favorite is grapeseed, because it's light,
[SPEAKER_06]: and jojoba.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you all are doing
topicals, but do you want to weigh in on
[SPEAKER_07]: them?
[SPEAKER_07]: We are not doing topicals, and I have
nothing to add to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have under them in the store.
[SPEAKER_04]: People come in, and one of the questions
they always ask about topicals is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is there a center?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a cannabis owner over to this
topical?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always try to stop them and say,
you're asking the worst person you can
[SPEAKER_04]: choose, because we're going to choose a
cannabis scent all day, so nothing really
[SPEAKER_04]: smells cannabis to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I try to objectively, most of the
cannabis oils, the other just basically 10
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes, and it's not toxic to the room if
you apply it to go back to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess for a lot of patients,
no disability is a big deal, especially if
[SPEAKER_08]: you're trying to get relief while you're
at work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a little extra to add to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to use isolates, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they are odorless, and our
consumers who use our products are not
[SPEAKER_06]: normally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, define isolates.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so an isolate is a crystalline powder
form of the THC-A or CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to use those because they don't
smell, like I said.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that said, most of the people who use
topicals really don't use cannabis in any
[SPEAKER_06]: other form, at least not at first.
[SPEAKER_06]: We find it's a gateway.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to say investment products,
but yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like the idea of isolates.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's happening is she's using the CBD
or THC-A that's been molecularly separated
[SPEAKER_08]: from the rest of the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what you're not getting is the
terpene profile, which is the aromatherapy
[SPEAKER_08]: of the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so she knows specifically that she
either wants to use THC-A and or CBD in
[SPEAKER_08]: her product.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you just peel off the terpenes in
this setting, you get to use the positive
[SPEAKER_08]: aspect she's going with, but without the
smell that lets your co-workers know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and part of that's because the
essential oils that I use, in my products,
[SPEAKER_06]: also have terpene profiles that are
beneficial for pain, inflammation,
[SPEAKER_06]: and skin trauma.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's combining that and finding the
sweet spot synergy in the formulation that
[SPEAKER_06]: really makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, oh, did you guys understand?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have a question for Tris.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you make the 50-50 tonic cold
THC-BG?
I do.
And what specifically do you recommend
them for?
[SPEAKER_06]: Pain, inflammation, and skin trauma.
[SPEAKER_06]: I worked for a really long time on the
formulation to make it work for everything
[SPEAKER_08]: from psoriasis to arthritis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this next question will start with you,
Nancy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're in a medical state, so I'm going
to ask the question in a way that we're
[SPEAKER_08]: going to be speaking about patients,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know that you work in a lot of rec
markets, so feel free to speak to that as
[SPEAKER_08]: well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I see lots of infused product
manufacturers using artificial ingredients
[SPEAKER_08]: in their products, colors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes they're using sugar.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we're talking about patients,
that's not necessarily going to be best
[SPEAKER_08]: for somebody with a compromised immune
system.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in your experience, how important is it
to avoid artificial colors and flavorings
[SPEAKER_08]: and sugar using these inputs when making
commercially available edibles for the
[SPEAKER_08]: greater market?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we all know that lots of people
are getting authorization and using
[SPEAKER_08]: medical products for life enjoyment as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But because we are here in Arizona,
we're thinking primarily in a medical way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So please.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an interesting question, and I will
answer it in a couple of different ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first is that there's actually
objective data that you can look at.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those of you who are going to be
here tomorrow, Liz Trujera from BDS
[SPEAKER_07]: Analytics is going to be speaking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm from Colorado, and worse than
Colorado, I'm from Boulder, the epicenter
[SPEAKER_07]: of all things politically correct and all
natural.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there was ever a place in the
universe where there's going to be people
[SPEAKER_07]: pushing back on artificial color and
flavors and all the rest of that,
[SPEAKER_07]: it would be Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to tell you that, objectively
speaking, and this was true before adult
[SPEAKER_07]: use, it doesn't matter that much to
people, truthfully.
[SPEAKER_07]: People will say it matters, but when it
comes to what people actually purchase,
[SPEAKER_07]: we all know that we're not consistent,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There are plenty of products out there
that have artificial color or flavors,
[SPEAKER_07]: and certainly almost every popular edible
product in Colorado has sugar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine included.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they all do just fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: BDS does track sugar-free products.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's barely a blip on the screen of what
is sold.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you guys can draw your own conclusions
about what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly, in a perfect world,
if you have a compromised immune system or
[SPEAKER_07]: medical issues, in a perfect world,
it's probably best to avoid all of those
[SPEAKER_07]: things.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the other hand, if you're eating a
gummy that's this big, I don't know that
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a huge issue, personally.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for some patients, it's the only way
they can have it be palatable,
[SPEAKER_08]: that they can eat it at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do a thing with the patients when I'm
consulting them, and I ask them what kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of dietary restrictions they put
themselves on, and then I just follow
[SPEAKER_04]: their lead.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's tinctures, there's canvas
honey, there's all kinds of edibles that
[SPEAKER_04]: you can give patients that are staying
away from sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I kind of concur with her,
even though I'm the biggest proponent of
[SPEAKER_04]: non-GMO organic eating, especially for any
of them, IBS, Qantas, things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my little 15 milligrams of dark canvas
chocolate every night makes me so happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't give that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gosh, so should I translate that into?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, sure, using any artificial
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Symbiotic preservatives and things like
that?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I stay away from them,
from the synthetics, it all costs.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the skin, I don't see a need to put
ADTA and dimethicone in my products.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be parabens and all that,
but that's skin care.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I eat gummies?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since you're all business people,
since you're here, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_07]: contextualize this a little bit more from
a business point of view, even though that
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't exactly the question I recognized.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you step back and look at the
edibles market right now, it's not a
[SPEAKER_07]: highly segmented market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I mean by that is, I have people
who come to me with some regularity,
[SPEAKER_07]: almost whispering, saying, I have the most
incredible recipe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm always very polite and I say,
unless you want to sign an NDA with me,
[SPEAKER_07]: don't even tell it to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they always want to tell it to me
anyway, and they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's always something incredibly
niche-y, like it's organic quinoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: So blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I really want to say to them
gently is, in the big world, you might
[SPEAKER_07]: have a niche with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the cannabis world, you're going to go
out of business in about a month.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the industry just isn't segmented
enough at this point of time, and the
[SPEAKER_07]: market isn't large enough for us to have
all these different little niches.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we all want to do good in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now, doing good in the world
means that you have to stay afloat as a
[SPEAKER_07]: business, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to take that reality into
account before you come out with products
[SPEAKER_07]: that are so super niche-y that there just
isn't enough of a market to support them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of the business reality,
from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was down in California speaking and
somebody gave me a sample, which ended up
[SPEAKER_08]: being the best edible I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it sat on the front of Mejoo.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it was a Persian-style jelly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: It probably had more to do with the fact
that it was a Persian-style jelly than it
[SPEAKER_08]: was a cannabis edible.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the packaging, talk about a niche of a
niche market.
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, you have to know what Mejoo
is, and then you have to be wanting to get
[SPEAKER_08]: your cannabis out of a jelly.
[SPEAKER_08]: But god, it was so delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Jane, one of the challenges with Mejoo
marketing topicals is that patients want
[SPEAKER_08]: to use it sparingly to save money.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet the whole thing with topicals is
that they need to be used regularly
[SPEAKER_08]: throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you work a lot with patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are any secrets that you can share
about encouraging patient compliance to
[SPEAKER_08]: use the topical when they're, at the same
time, trying to save money by not using
[SPEAKER_08]: the topical?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have some strange analogies I use
with patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they come in for the first time,
I tell them they're like a car with no oil
[SPEAKER_04]: in the tank, and the oil in the tank needs
to be CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I tell them that CBD does not really
work if you're deficient in it for the
[SPEAKER_04]: first 30 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you need to give it at least 30 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I compare it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say, this is your marijuana
multi-vitamin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to take this every day
like you take your vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know if your vitamin D is
working, but you know intrinsically that
[SPEAKER_04]: you need to take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get them on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I start talking about the CBD
topicals for neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say to them, this is best used when
your pores are open after a shower,
[SPEAKER_04]: or you can wrap a few in a hot towel and
have a guy put the topical on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't expect results for three to five
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start using this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use it at night before you go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use it in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might use it in the middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's for neuropathy, you've got to give
it time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't set any false expectations
with these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell them flat out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I used to teach fourth grades.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had that authoritative, sterile way to
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't go home and call me the
next day and say, oh, my CBD didn't work,
[SPEAKER_04]: because they know they have to give it at
least 30 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they know at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when people come in and the thing I
hate to hear is, I just flushed all my
[SPEAKER_04]: prescriptions down the toilet an hour
before this appointment, because you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to get me off of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I say to people, sure you want to
use cannabis to reduce opiate use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a month, two months, three months.
[SPEAKER_04]: In three months, we can honestly have a
conversation where you're reduced greatly
[SPEAKER_04]: with 50% minimum.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everything takes time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took you time to get addicted to the
opiates.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to take you time to get you off
the opiate.
[SPEAKER_04]: People want an instant fix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all this digital media.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry, but we've got to go back to
the wagon train right now, because you've
[SPEAKER_04]: been on this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canvas is not fast and furious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to weigh in on this?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go about corollary to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't have any topicals,
but we do have a family of extended
[SPEAKER_07]: release capsules.
[SPEAKER_07]: To my knowledge, the only extended release
capsules on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is a very similar thing to what
Jane is talking about, that we have to do
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of training with people to
understand that things need to build up in
[SPEAKER_07]: your system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for any extended release product,
not just for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think setting expectations is the key
to having people have successful
[SPEAKER_07]: experiences with these types of products.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you run into this a lot,
Tristan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I run into this a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for some people, they apply the oil and
rub it in, and it works immediately for a
[SPEAKER_06]: product.
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, I want to get your patience
going.
[SPEAKER_06]: That said, we have other patients who have
let us know that it took three days for
[SPEAKER_06]: them to get lasting results.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the analogy I like to use,
or it's not really an analogy,
[SPEAKER_06]: is that your body's endocannabinoid system
needs to be boosted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people are deficient.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you're applying a topical product
to treat pain or inflammation,
[SPEAKER_06]: what you're doing is you're boosting your
body's ability to take care of itself in
[SPEAKER_06]: that spot over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so applying it five to seven times a
day in the beginning will allow someone to
[SPEAKER_06]: only have to use it once or twice a day or
every other day two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to double down on that,
Tristan.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you were designing your packaging,
how did you weigh how to explain the usage
[SPEAKER_08]: of it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you want to get them enough
compliance that it helps.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you also don't want to say that it's
possibly going to leak.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how did you weigh that out for
yourself?
[SPEAKER_08]: For the package designers?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got taglines that are put it
where it hurts, rub it in, repeat.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just really simple instructions and
taglines.
[SPEAKER_06]: That said, if you read the directions on
my package, it says to apply it sparingly
[SPEAKER_06]: often.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sparingly often.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this next question, we're going to
start with, oh, it looks like we're back
[SPEAKER_08]: to you, Tristan.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll come this way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know this is kind of a general
question, but I wanted more to elicit
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for generations, infused products were
made from trim, which until recently was
[SPEAKER_08]: known as trash, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you find, oh, there's good things
we can do with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But today now, infused product designers
have an array of materials that they can
[SPEAKER_08]: choose from.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can go from trim to whole flour to
purchasing extracted oils.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a product designer, you've got a lot of
options.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what advice would you give and what
advice would you offer a product designer
[SPEAKER_08]: in the room considering what material to
use for their infused product?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the first piece of advice I have is
to know your source.
[SPEAKER_06]: So even if you're buying extracted oil,
go to the farm that it was grown at.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out, see what their growing
practices are, see how they care for their
[SPEAKER_06]: plants, see what kind of chemicals they
use on their plants, try and go organic if
[SPEAKER_06]: you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really where it's at, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So know your producer.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best advice I can give.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually a very interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've been in business in Colorado
since 2010.
[SPEAKER_07]: And back in the day, there was no
extracted oil that you could buy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was likened to, like, if you were
for a motor company and you said,
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to build cars.
[SPEAKER_07]: And somebody said, fantastic, first you
need to learn how to make steel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But now we have choices.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the answers to the question
depends on what it is that you're trying
[SPEAKER_07]: to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Trista was talking before about
isolates, which are the purest form that
[SPEAKER_07]: you can get.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other big trend in the industry right
now is distillates, which is usually you
[SPEAKER_07]: start out with an extracted oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's a CO2 extracted oil is the
most general one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you do a secondary technique,
which is called slow path distillation.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a variety of ways to do
distillation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what it does is it strips out the
waxes and the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_07]: It also strips out the turpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the turpenes, in addition to adding
smell to the product, also have medicinal
[SPEAKER_07]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're also the determinants of
whether an indica feels like an indica or
[SPEAKER_07]: a sativa feels like a sativa.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if what you're trying to make is a
class-specific edible that has some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: properties of an indica versus a sativa,
that's a whole debate that we can talk
[SPEAKER_07]: about there too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you wouldn't want to use an extracted
oil that had gone through the distillate
[SPEAKER_07]: process.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd either want to extract it yourself
or you'd want to buy what we in Colorado
[SPEAKER_07]: call a kitchen oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's that variable on it,
what you're trying to do with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other issue is just what are your
capabilities as a company?
[SPEAKER_07]: To do your own extraction requires
equipment.
[SPEAKER_07]: It requires a skill set.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it requires more time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do both.
[SPEAKER_07]: We buy it on an extracted oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: We buy it distillate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also have CO2 extractors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for years we had butane extractors,
which we've just taken down.
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of the things that happens is
after you do the first level of
[SPEAKER_07]: extraction, with the trim, whether you're
using CO2 or whether you're using a
[SPEAKER_07]: solvent of some sort, there's a whole
secondary process that has to happen where
[SPEAKER_07]: you're winterizing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're removing the waxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it adds a lot of time to the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're a very high-volume company
like we are, there's a big advantage to
[SPEAKER_07]: using an extracted oil and using a
distillate if you don't need some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: properties that the terpenes add because
it speeds things up tremendously.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not the most simple,
straightforward answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: The real answer is it depends.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are trying to get what we call the
entourage effect or get the benefits of
[SPEAKER_07]: everything in the plant, then you probably
want to do your own extraction so you can
[SPEAKER_07]: control that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been in the industry since the
start here in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_04]: And six years ago, anyone making an animal
was using trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, I don't know anyone using trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: So put that right out of your head if
you're thinking you're going to make your
[SPEAKER_04]: animals a trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not going to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a reason why that you're aware
of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, number one, it's quality in quality
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last time I looked at my
compounded trim that was going out to an
[SPEAKER_04]: edible place, it was not a pretty sight.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not something that people that are
successful at making animals use.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not the case in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just have to give a different
perspective.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most edibles companies in Colorado still
make their edibles from trim.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they extracted themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, the extracted oil industry is just
starting to really take hold in Colorado
[SPEAKER_07]: and to have enough options that larger
companies are looking at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we get absolutely beautiful trim with
levels of THC and CBD that rival the whole
[SPEAKER_07]: plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get more out of the whole plant,
but you also pay four to five times as
[SPEAKER_07]: much for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So from an economics point of view,
I would say if you're not in a state that
[SPEAKER_07]: has a robust extracted oil option for you,
don't shy away from trim.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great way to make animals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I have to disagree with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's to Trista's point,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: To know your source.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because even within any particular state,
you're going to have people who are
[SPEAKER_08]: producing high quality trim and some of it
which is more like the word trash,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So know your source and go visit the
facility and see how it could be degraded
[SPEAKER_08]: a long way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just say one more quick thing on
that?
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that we do with trim,
and I highly encourage anybody who's using
[SPEAKER_07]: trim to do this, is we track and measure
every possible metric there is on trim.
[SPEAKER_07]: We measure the potency.
[SPEAKER_07]: We measure the smell, the color,
the final yield after it's been
[SPEAKER_07]: winterized.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is measured down to the strain
levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we're negotiating prices on trim,
we do it from a basic base of a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: knowledge over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to clarify a couple of things
because I've heard both of you speak and I
[SPEAKER_06]: think that you're talking about,
Jane, you're talking about not using trim
[SPEAKER_06]: directly to make a product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're talking about buying trim and
turning it into an extract.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you use trim to make a product?
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you use trim to make a product?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like you can do an oil infusion or
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in the coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, I think what was trying to
be said was that don't use trim just
[SPEAKER_06]: straight up making a product.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to get a consistent
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would taste horrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing is to know that... So
people can use pesticides on the flower or
[SPEAKER_06]: on their plants and have their flower pass
the pesticide test, but the trim won't
[SPEAKER_06]: pass.
[SPEAKER_06]: So be really careful about that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really important that we have clean
material to start with.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Nancy, let's start with you on this
last question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what considerations should infused
product designers think about when it
[SPEAKER_08]: comes to shelf life?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great one.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we first started out, we had in
our lineup a variety of baked goods.
[SPEAKER_07]: And over time we completely phased them
out because we found that our sweet spot
[SPEAKER_07]: was really things that had long shelf
life.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only way that we could figure out how
to make a brownie last for more than two
[SPEAKER_07]: weeks was to put things like mold
inhibitor in it, which we didn't want to
[SPEAKER_07]: do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that said, I have good friends in the
industry who do make baked goods and they
[SPEAKER_07]: have figured out somehow how to extend the
shelf life.
[SPEAKER_07]: We never did.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we dealt with it by just avoiding the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of our core criteria for
selecting new products is that it has a
[SPEAKER_07]: shelf life of at least six months.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also do shelf life testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we were making products, we actually
have this little thing that we put it in
[SPEAKER_07]: and it kind of simulates different
durations on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a really, really important
consideration.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a state like ours, which is a fairly
good sized state, for us to get out to the
[SPEAKER_07]: western slope, which is, you know,
we're in Boulder, so that's a good five to
[SPEAKER_07]: six hour drive.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're only sending our couriers or outside
couriers out there once a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, if you have a product that
begins to get stammered two weeks,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're going to end up having customers in
that situation who are not very happy with
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a small space in the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's under 2,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we order edibles, and I'm not
talking about just the products we carry,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the products from all the other
kitchens, it's only a week order and we
[SPEAKER_04]: turn over those edibles every week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of amazing to me how savvy
the patients are because I had a patient
[SPEAKER_04]: the other day in the lobby and she said,
yeah, I've got this whole list of edibles
[SPEAKER_04]: I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And your dispensary carry is the freshest
made edibles of anyone around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we don't have the room to keep it
on hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's worked in our favor that we turn
it over that quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I don't want to stand
around and get lied to.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually a really good insight for
retailers, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if your distributor is willing to
deliver to you more often, not only does
[SPEAKER_08]: it mean that you've got fresher product,
but also your revenue stream is going to
[SPEAKER_08]: be more balanced because you're not
putting out larger sums of money every few
[SPEAKER_08]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a consistent amount.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really insightful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for topicals, it's a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our oils have a two-year shelf life at
least, which I think is really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm currently working on a lotion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to not put nasty ingredients in a
lotion and have it have a great shelf life
[SPEAKER_06]: is actually pretty challenging.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I've found what we need in
order to do it naturally, with
[SPEAKER_06]: plant-derived preservatives.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've got time for a couple questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have one?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you stand up and speak up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like education is a really
big part of the blood tender's job and
[SPEAKER_01]: especially selling your products.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys recommend as education
for the blood tenders?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you go about doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what is the best way to make sure that
the blood tenders are selling your
products?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can comment on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually in the process of building
out a much more in-depth training program.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we go into the dispensaries and do
blood tender training in the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're actually partnering with medical
professionals because I don't have that
[SPEAKER_07]: expertise in my own company to really help
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Understand not just the basics of,
you know, start low and go slow,
[SPEAKER_07]: but really helping them understand how
animals are metabolized in the body and
[SPEAKER_07]: getting a little bit deeper into that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, in Colorado, we have some very large,
very large in the cannabis world,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, 15, 17 store chains.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they do have a lot more training
material themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the average smaller dispensary chain
or the one-off ones, in general,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's the responsibility of the
manufacturers to be bringing that
[SPEAKER_07]: information to them and helping them do
the very best they can do for their
[SPEAKER_07]: customers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I want to add to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also do blood tender training,
both in the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're also starting a program where
we're bringing them into our facility and
[SPEAKER_06]: doing teaching classes there, PowerPoint,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a wholesale team that goes out,
and they do giveaways, and they educate
[SPEAKER_04]: the blood tenders of the facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: They educate the patients while they're
there, try to make it a fun thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's music and all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a good time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned a lot of THC and CBD in your
presentations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just generally, the main two can have
noise that I talked about a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more awareness of terpenes now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there currently a market for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you perceive there being a market for
edibles and infused products with other
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids as isolates or as an entire
spectrum?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically what he asked is,
is there a market for other cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_06]: and specifically other cannabinoid-infused
products?
[SPEAKER_06]: And absolutely is the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could find both CDC and CBG,
that would be going into my product as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the things that's happening in
the extraction world is that people's
[SPEAKER_07]: ability to extract is getting more precise
and more targeted.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they are beginning to be able to
consistently pull off the other
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: At least some of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like 103 of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But CBG and CBN being the two that Trista
just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think where the future of the
industry is going, and edibles included,
[SPEAKER_07]: is to really leverage that ability to
extract precisely and then to stack things
[SPEAKER_07]: at different ratios to address different
medical concerns and to create specific
[SPEAKER_07]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that said, I think we're quite a ways
away from being able to do that
[SPEAKER_07]: effectively because we don't really have a
lot of experience or database of doing
[SPEAKER_07]: that yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's where it's going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at Mary's medicinal
products, you know, you see they started
[SPEAKER_04]: out with THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they have CBN patches.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have THC-A patches.
[SPEAKER_04]: The industry is moving as, you know,
you can come up with all these products
[SPEAKER_04]: that would do wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But until you educate the public and until
you educate your bartenders and talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: them, they're going to sit there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got to be careful that you don't
come out too early with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're going to design a product
that is using a minor cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_08]: make sure you know that your supplier is
going to stay in business too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I saw that happen in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: A company came out with a really great CBN
tab that helped you go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they started selling the heck out of
them and then their supplier went under
[SPEAKER_08]: and no one else was isolating CBN.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have got time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes your product medical?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, what makes your product medical?
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes that product?
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes you to be able to use the word
medical, what backs your foundation that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a medical product?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a regulatory distinction as
opposed to a distinction of the product
[SPEAKER_07]: itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have in Colorado, we have medical,
we have adult use.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the same products in both markets.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not anything that makes a medical
product medical from a formulation point
[SPEAKER_07]: of view.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the channel through which it's
sold.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have time for one more question then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, all the way in back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking back on this question,
the ability to isolate and formulate
[SPEAKER_02]: products that have different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you concerned, I guess, about the
future of the edibles in the huge product
[SPEAKER_02]: market as opposed to more
pharmaceutical-type products like capsules
[SPEAKER_02]: and instead of reduced caps?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not go to a bakery and get my cookies
and get a capsule or some other product
[SPEAKER_02]: that has the stacked cannabinoids and
caffeine that I want?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why keep them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you refuse to get a type of vehicle?
[SPEAKER_06]: Topically, you can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll take the first leg of this
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first started out in the industry
and people started making comments about,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, they wanted this in a capsule,
my gut reaction was the typical grassroots
[SPEAKER_04]: hippie.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to get away from the pills.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would somebody want to take a cannabis
pill?
[SPEAKER_04]: But as time progresses, you see the
advantages.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's always gonna be a matter of
choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think both methods of obtaining your
medicine are gonna be here to stay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a lot of people bringing capsules
into their dispensaries and I think that's
[SPEAKER_04]: a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, people need choices.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a certain percentage of people
that just will never take a cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: capsule, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to mention the health benefits of dark
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I guess the other thing that I
would say about that is I agree with the
[SPEAKER_07]: choice thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing is that different people's
bodies metabolize things differently and
[SPEAKER_07]: there's different levels of
bioavailability depending on people,
[SPEAKER_07]: how people create their capsules and how
they create their edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And different people just find that
different things work well for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that element of choice is even just
beyond the, do I want a treat or do I want
[SPEAKER_07]: to take a capsule?
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is how it impacts the body.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So before we finish, I want to make sure I
plug in the Dope Magazine party this
[SPEAKER_08]: evening at six o'clock on the roof of the
Clarendon Hotel rooftop.
[SPEAKER_08]: And other than that, oh, also the next
panel will include pro football athlete
[SPEAKER_08]: Martin Washington, which should be
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so let us thank Tristan O'Kell,
Nancy Wegman, and Julie Fisk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
