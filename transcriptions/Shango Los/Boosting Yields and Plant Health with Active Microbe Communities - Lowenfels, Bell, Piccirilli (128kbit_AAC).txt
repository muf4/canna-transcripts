[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys just sitting in here to,
you know, relax, or are you listening?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be micro-dots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, alright, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Micros?
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't like micro-dots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you said micro-dots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's dark in here because this is the
micro-dosing panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, welcome everybody to the 130
panel on soil micro-communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your emcee for the discussion,
Shane Golos.

[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a little bit of time at the end
for those.
own.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, considering we've got three
epic living soil folks here in 45 minutes,
[SPEAKER_04]: we want to let them get as much in as they
can.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, introductions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff Lowenfels is a reformed lawyer and
author of the award-winning and
[SPEAKER_04]: best-selling books Teaming with Microbes,
The Organic Gardener's Guide to the Soil
[SPEAKER_04]: Food Web, Teaming with Nutrients,
The Organic Gardener's Guide to Optimizing
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant Nutrition, and his third book in the
soils trilogy, Teaming with Fungi,
[SPEAKER_04]: The Organic Gardener's Guide to
Mycorrhizae, which was published in
[SPEAKER_04]: January and instantly became a
best-seller.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff also pens the longest-running garden
column in North America, having never
[SPEAKER_04]: missed a week in 40 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love this part.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2005, he was inducted into the Garden
Writers of America Hall of Fame,
[SPEAKER_04]: the highest honor a garden writer can
attain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cullen Bell is the co-founder,
co-inventor, and chief growth officer at
[SPEAKER_04]: Grossentia, the parent company of Mammoth
Microbes, which you've more likely heard
[SPEAKER_04]: of more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cullen completed his Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_04]: in soil microbial ecology in 2009,
and as a researcher or scientist at
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado State University, Cullen
published dozens of peer-reviewed
[SPEAKER_04]: publications that were focused on
hallucinating microbial mediated processes
[SPEAKER_04]: that enhance plant growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cullen left his academic position at
Colorado State University in March 2015 to
[SPEAKER_04]: launch Grossentia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their first product, Mammoth Pea,
is a beneficial bacterial bloom stimulant
[SPEAKER_04]: that targets phosphorous cycling to
maximize both quality and quantity of
[SPEAKER_04]: yield in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thousands of producers around the world
are now using this for reporting
[SPEAKER_04]: overwhelming positive results,
including in my home garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mammoth Pea is now sold in over 900 stores
globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, John Bucciarelli is founder of
Cutting Edge Solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: As an early adopter of the soil food web
system, his business drive is rooted in
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainable agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: John helped to develop the Cutting Edge
product line to support natural soil
[SPEAKER_04]: ecology, including their flagship product,
Humtea, and co-founded a microbiology lab
[SPEAKER_04]: in 2004 to support their research efforts.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of John's current side projects is
growing milkweed and a variety of
[SPEAKER_04]: pollen-producing flowers for migrating
butterflies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's offer the panel a warm welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the way that we're gonna do the panel
today is we're gonna start out by asking a
[SPEAKER_04]: question to one of our panelists,
and then the other two panelists will have
[SPEAKER_04]: an opportunity to lean in on that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first question's gonna go,
start with Jeff, and then we'll work our
[SPEAKER_04]: way this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be patient with this first question.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got kind of a long setup,
but here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a commercial growing operation,
conservation of resources, including time
[SPEAKER_04]: and money, is vital, and changing from
traditional cannabis growing techniques
[SPEAKER_04]: consisting of bottled salt and nutrients
to instead using holistic growing
[SPEAKER_04]: techniques that can bring the soil life
can seem differently expensive in time,
[SPEAKER_04]: training, and changes to operating
procedures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Management often resists making the switch
because they're afraid of the risk
[SPEAKER_04]: involved with doing something differently
when so much is on the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff, can focusing on building thriving
micro communities in a commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: operation substrates be financially
beneficial in addition to just being more
[SPEAKER_04]: natural?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, of course it can, and I think the
reason comes down to something that people
[SPEAKER_05]: in California are gonna experience pretty
darn soon, and people in Washington State
[SPEAKER_05]: and people in Alaska as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea of selling a product that's not
organic, and you need microbes to make the
[SPEAKER_05]: product organic as far as I'm concerned,
is just death to the person who's smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: or vaporizing or eating your product if
it's not processed properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think the regulatory
organizations are gonna require a
[SPEAKER_05]: microbial-based approach to growing
cannabis if you're gonna sell it as a
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine for sure, and recreational
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'll comment on that also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that with any kind of management,
there's a process, and anyone would be
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant to a complete turnover without
understanding the value, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's actually a real value,
and we've done a lot of studies now where
[SPEAKER_01]: we look at different management practices,
and we get different characteristics of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and the final quality and yield
of plants based on these different
[SPEAKER_01]: management practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's gonna take the process and
the evolution of owning hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation facilities to understand what
that value proposition is and how these
[SPEAKER_01]: different management practices may be a
conversion for this conversation from a
[SPEAKER_01]: more mineral or traditional cultivation to
more of an organic, incorporating microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: and incorporating more natural processes
into the cultivation practices will
[SPEAKER_01]: support better quality and allow the plant
to maximize its phenotypic potential,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you're getting the qualities of the
plant for what you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've seen a lot of data now that
really surprises me and encourages me that
[SPEAKER_01]: as we transition to more organic
practices, we do see more quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: more terpene profiles without sacrificing
yield, and in many cases, when we dial
[SPEAKER_01]: that in, we can get as good of a yield or
even better yield increases with that
[SPEAKER_01]: quality method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tying quality to those management
practices and value is where that
[SPEAKER_01]: transition's gonna occur, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there have been quite a few studies,
I don't know, has anyone, does anyone here
[SPEAKER_02]: know who Elaine Amon is?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great, somebody raised their hand,
because I was at the National Heirloom
[SPEAKER_02]: Expo, my company was like in Santa Rosa,
happens to be at the fairgrounds of,
[SPEAKER_02]: there were like 300 people and no one
raised their hand except me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What Colin's saying about the data and the
studies, you know, they're fairly recent,
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't just 2003, I mean here we are in
Richmond, Albany's next door, and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: where the USDA lab is that decided to
study compost tea, and their study was
[SPEAKER_02]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that you would ever do this at home,
but they took chicken shit and put it in
[SPEAKER_02]: water and then added molasses and decided
that compost tea is really E.
[SPEAKER_02]: coli.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Elaine Amon, who was at Corvallis,
the University of Oregon then,
[SPEAKER_02]: countered that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, there's quite a bit of a
back and forth between her and this one
[SPEAKER_02]: scientist, strangely enough, his last name
was Stanker.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can only imagine the stank of
that, their particular compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, many years have passed, and
scientists like Colin have gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: involved, and Jeff, you know, he was one
of the early people.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I met him at Soul Food Lab,
I think in 98 or 99, and so there's been a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of dedicated people that have shown
that using compost teas and making good
[SPEAKER_02]: quality compost is a start in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, there's products
that, as you probably hear from Colin,
[SPEAKER_02]: that have come out that his company makes,
or that Hum Tea is an example of that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organisms that have come from good compost
that are able to break down the nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: that you were mending the soil with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, saving the soil indoors has become a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and hold on to that mic,
John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Conveniently, the next question starts
with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, much of the market for flour is based
on bag appeal, and many consider frosty
[SPEAKER_04]: flours an intense coloration to be a
result of intense synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: What can commercial scale growers do to
create frosty flours with great bag
[SPEAKER_04]: appeal, while also respecting the health
of the substrate microbe communities?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, probably the most important thing
that some sort of commercial fertilizer
[SPEAKER_02]: person could ever tell you is that it's
rooted in manganese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Manganese is a key micronutrient that
basically all plants use and produce an
[SPEAKER_02]: enzyme that acts as a catalyst and lets
nitrogen up into the plant and through the
[SPEAKER_02]: cells without burning them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you have the right level of
manganese, you're not getting tip burn,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're not getting this slight curling
or this slight interveinal yellowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You notice if you actually sent in leaf
samples and had a nutritional profile done
[SPEAKER_02]: that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, manganese is very important in the
Cannabisiae family and well studied in
[SPEAKER_02]: hops, and the two plants in the
Cannabisiae family are hops and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you need manganese for the plants to
make two coenzymes that boost the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profile, and when the terpene profile is
boosted, you'll see more stalk flange or
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes or what people call crystals,
and you need to fill those with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are resins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in terms of bag appeal, you're looking
for manganese.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you get this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, pretty much everything on the market
is manganese EETA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I worked on a bio chelation process to
come up with an organic form of manganese,
[SPEAKER_02]: and now there's other products too that
are amino acid chelated that are also
[SPEAKER_02]: organic and allowed too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, people are looking at manganese more
for that bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I want to comment on my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I end up now with this company made with
microbes traveling all over the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: working with growers through South
America, through Europe, and of course in
[SPEAKER_01]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this transition and maybe this
note of bag appeal is going to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: ephemeral than we think, although everyone
wants to see really nice-looking flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen pushback also from people who
don't feel like it's as natural as it
[SPEAKER_01]: could be, and there's this pushback for
people with EGRs where it's turned into a
[SPEAKER_01]: negative thing if the bud actually looks
too good.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have come up to me in several
occasions now recently showing me this
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, and I don't know who's grown it,
and they're asking me is this natural,
[SPEAKER_01]: is this organically grown because it just
looks too good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I will say, and I hear this across
the world from growers and consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: is people want quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yield is becoming easier to attain,
but we're trying to maximize quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only quality as far as the medicinal
property of the different cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: and THC is a quality metric, and CBD is a
quality metric, and there's many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many other cannabinoids, but then these
terpene qualities and these terpene smells
[SPEAKER_01]: that turn into and translate to flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of consumers really want that
more so than a good-looking bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just my personal opinion that I
formed over the last year when I've
[SPEAKER_01]: actually engaged in a broader audience
than I'm used to engaging in, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: we achieved that.
[SPEAKER_01]: By transitioning to more natural solutions
and deliberating and delivering the
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients, which I think is a huge
missing component.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's missing, we're gonna see clear
negative results, I'll refer to those as
[SPEAKER_01]: negative results, in quality and the
profile that we want out of our flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that transition to the quality is
what I think is gonna be the continued
[SPEAKER_01]: value that's gonna distinguish cultivators
from maybe a bag of peels to a real
[SPEAKER_01]: product that people want to continue to
purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: May that transition happen smoothly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I almost forgot the question here,
but I think, let me just, I agree with
[SPEAKER_05]: your answers, I would add boron,
incidentally, if you don't have boron,
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't get a flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the problem I see is that,
yeah, people want to know what they're
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking, so I'm gonna just sort of shift
this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they look at numbers, you know,
hopefully we're gonna start looking at
[SPEAKER_05]: terpene profiles, because that's really
where it's at.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you 100%, it's not sativa or
indica, it's what the terpene profile is
[SPEAKER_05]: and how they mix together.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also the age of the flower,
so that if you get a flower where all the
[SPEAKER_05]: trichomes are brown, you're gonna get a
little indicky, kind of heavy stone,
[SPEAKER_05]: and if they're still chrisley,
you're gonna get a much higher up stone.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem I see is that the
government that we own is not gonna care
[SPEAKER_05]: whether you want to see the flower or not
to be able to tell what you're buying.
[SPEAKER_05]: In California, I understand, they're gonna
seal them up.
[SPEAKER_05]: No more jars, no more smelling,
no more looking, which is what they do in
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington State.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the worst experience to go into a
Washington State cannabis store and buy
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get this piece of plastic,
you don't know what's behind it,
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't know how old it is, you don't
know what it looks like or what it smells
[SPEAKER_05]: like.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy, it's stupid, and it's
happening here in California, because
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody's sitting on their hands,
instead of telling the California people,
[SPEAKER_05]: hey, we're the only owners of this
government, and we don't want to do it
[SPEAKER_05]: that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's just very, very quiet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just mentioning that, but I agree
with all of your answers, and I don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: if I hit anything or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are three books that I wrote,
and they support everything that this
[SPEAKER_05]: gentleman does, and that this gentleman
does.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't know how your plants are
getting their food organically,
[SPEAKER_05]: you need to learn that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't know what nutrients your
plant needs and what each individual
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrient does, and how it does it,
so that you know, for example,
[SPEAKER_05]: that if your temperature is between 76 and
78, you're at the optimum, because the
[SPEAKER_05]: enzyme production is working.
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta know this stuff, and then you
end up organically with a plant that is
[SPEAKER_05]: natural, that has all of the trichomes
that it's supposed to have on it,
[SPEAKER_05]: that does its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to tag on that, the reference
to the books, not that I'm plugging Jeff,
[SPEAKER_01]: or his work, but I will say, you know,
I've read a lot of books that are PhD in
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbiology, so I've read a lot of pretty
dense books, and I got a lot out of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I probably got more out of reading
Jeff's books, because it's on the level of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge and digestibility, that he
presents information, so I think they're
[SPEAKER_01]: excellent resources, and I really
appreciate you putting those out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're incredible books, and it's amazing
to find a book that actually has the depth
[SPEAKER_04]: in your experience, but also is written in
a way that a lay person can read them as
[SPEAKER_04]: well, and get a lot out of them,
so they're good for both pros,
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you're a pro, you probably already
read them, and for newbies as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, while you've got the mic there,
so establishing a commercial operation can
[SPEAKER_04]: seem like a long-term project,
and it is, but at some point, cultivators
[SPEAKER_04]: who want to make the switch to probiotic
growing techniques have to make the jump,
[SPEAKER_04]: like today is the day we're going to do
it, and get up to high yields and
[SPEAKER_04]: repeatable results fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: What advice would you give to a
cultivator, ready to make the switch to
[SPEAKER_04]: probiotic, so they quickly achieve a
baseline of production that they can
[SPEAKER_04]: refine over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really good question,
and I think about that question in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anyone can afford,
no matter what we're doing, what business
[SPEAKER_01]: we're in, and cultivation as a business,
we have to mitigate risk versus reward,
[SPEAKER_01]: and switching everything without having a
baseline of competence is very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very risky, and so I think any
professional business, no matter what
[SPEAKER_01]: switch it is, even in my manufacturing
company, we manufacture microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you grow up microbes, it looks like a
microbrewer operation, change anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: I experiment with some solutions,
get the data, and then I inform our
[SPEAKER_01]: changes based on the data we collect,
and if it's a positive move, I incorporate
[SPEAKER_01]: that to a larger scale, and I think that's
the same thing that any cultivator is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do, and every cultivator we work
with, on a large scale, typically has
[SPEAKER_01]: experimental rooms, and they'll experiment
with solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's a lot of great
products out there that allow traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis growers using mineral or
synthetics to incorporate steps using
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes in natural processes,
so you can start to get that confidence
[SPEAKER_01]: that, wow, there is benefit in using
microbes, there are benefits in adding
[SPEAKER_01]: these organic additives that allow me to
get value, and that's where I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: the products that we make, and products in
the market in general that are
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial-based and natural-based,
do a real service for the impact I wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to make as a microbiologist in academia,
which is to start to educate and bridge
[SPEAKER_01]: natural processes into conventional
agriculture, and allowing to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: products that are compatible, that are
very effective, and that are very low-risk
[SPEAKER_01]: and high-reward, meaning that you can add
them in, not change a thing, and see these
[SPEAKER_01]: results, is a very good step.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next step, when we start talking about
outside of additives, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: easy, is the infrastructure and the living
soil or the beds or however these
[SPEAKER_01]: processes are, and that's another level of
commitment, but I think the step is
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding that there is value,
and then buying into it and making that
[SPEAKER_01]: next investment in time and money to
create the next round of substrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: organic substrate, growing conditions,
to really embrace organic growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to sometimes convince owners or
investors to follow any kind of living
[SPEAKER_02]: soil bed, or even to use microbes,
or even to use a mat or tea or home tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the ways that I bridge that is by
showing them, often when they're in their
[SPEAKER_02]: cold, they have sealed brooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when they have sealed brooms,
they have to add CO2, so if you can show
[SPEAKER_02]: them their own data logger, a lot of
times, surprisingly, people who have spent
[SPEAKER_02]: $30 million on their grow facility don't
even know what the equipment is that is in
[SPEAKER_02]: their grow facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to walk them through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show them how the data logger works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show them the CO2 levels, and I know from
experience that when you use an ad of pee
[SPEAKER_02]: and home tea in not only just a living
soil bed, but in, say, a one-gold soil
[SPEAKER_02]: bed, there's enough carbon there that the
microbes break down to give off CO2,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you can see CO2 levels hit 3,000 parts
per million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way over what you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reader, once it's at 1,400,
is going to click off and not have any
[SPEAKER_02]: more CO2 in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: The advantage, they save a tiny bit of
money, but you're showing them that the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes are working and doing something,
and one of the important nutrients for
[SPEAKER_02]: plants is CO2, is carbon, so they can
readily see the plants green up,
[SPEAKER_02]: grow healthier, just by having those
higher levels of CO2 than they were
[SPEAKER_02]: naturally at in the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in rooms like that, even if they're
500-light rooms, you find that CO2 lasts
[SPEAKER_02]: for three to five hours before your
regular CO2 kicks on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're already showing them something.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the show me industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about bag appeal a minute
ago, but now we're talking about micro
[SPEAKER_02]: appeal, and that's part of it,
is just showing them something simple like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I talk to the cannabis group,
I now show a picture of a leaf from one of
[SPEAKER_05]: my plants that I grew last summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I struggle with it to show how big the
picture of the leaf is.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a leaf from a plant where I used a
mycorrhizal fungi, whereas before I hadn't
[SPEAKER_05]: been using the mycorrhizal fungi,
and the leaf I first show next to one of
[SPEAKER_05]: my books, and it covers the entire book,
but you don't really get a feel for how
[SPEAKER_05]: big's that book, and so I go through my
head.
[SPEAKER_05]: It covers my entire head, and then I take
a cast iron prion pin.
[SPEAKER_05]: You all know how big those are.
[SPEAKER_05]: This leaf covers the entire prion pin,
and I say to people, if you don't believe
[SPEAKER_05]: in mycorrhizal fungi, then you're not
looking at these pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know they work.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that Mammoth Pea works.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cannabis industry is full of the
finest growers in the world, Barney.
[SPEAKER_05]: This industry has experimented more than
agriculture has.
[SPEAKER_05]: This industry is more conversant,
shares more information than the
[SPEAKER_05]: agricultural industry does.
[SPEAKER_05]: There seems to be very little concern
about competition between growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: People talk, they join associations,
et cetera, et cetera, and we are so much
[SPEAKER_05]: more advanced in terms of using the things
that Bayer, which I guess we ought to call
[SPEAKER_05]: Bayer, and the Scott's Miracle Grow folks
are all starting to get into.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been doing this as an industry with
smaller companies for years and years and
[SPEAKER_05]: years, so I don't think there should be
any problem whatsoever convincing a
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis grower on a commercial basis that
all of this stuff makes sense,
[SPEAKER_05]: this stuff works.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a backup document study by
numbers of growers that they can talk to
[SPEAKER_05]: on everything that's available,
because if it doesn't work in this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, it doesn't stick around,
with a couple of exceptions, maybe Miracle
[SPEAKER_05]: Grow and some of that other stuff,
but even that stuff, people realize,
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't work the way this other stuff
does, and you learn, you read the
[SPEAKER_05]: magazines, and listen, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera, so I don't think
[SPEAKER_04]: there's gonna be a problem here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first off, the fact that we are doing a
panel with this much experience in 45
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes is a sin, right, but we're gonna
work with what we got.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're gonna do is we're gonna ask
one more question formally, and then bring
[SPEAKER_04]: the mic out to you, because I know that
you're gonna have questions, so start
[SPEAKER_04]: formulating now, and I'll be right with
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the last question for you fellas,
and this is one I didn't let you know
[SPEAKER_04]: about in advance, so we're gonna have to
work extemporaneous with me, is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well you didn't check your email,
John.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys are asked questions often,
you're on podcasts, you're public speakers
[SPEAKER_04]: like this, and we all tend to sometimes
ask you the same things over and over.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is something that you are working on,
or that you've realized yourself recently,
[SPEAKER_04]: that you are excited about, that I should
be asking you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that you are personally jacked
up about and excited, that you just wanna
[SPEAKER_04]: break out to us right now, because you got
an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jeff, is that Alaskan Thunderfuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the funny thing was, you're only
allowed to grow six plants in Alaska,
[SPEAKER_05]: because I read a garden column where
people come and visit my house and
[SPEAKER_05]: everything, you know, I gotta be a little
bit careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I only grew six plants last year,
and this was the one plant I was testing
[SPEAKER_05]: and had the control, it turned out to be a
male plant on top of everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, I don't even know what kind it
was.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's partner that didn't get the
mycorrhizal fungi, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Small leaves, also a male plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unbelievable difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, obviously with teaming with fungi,
I'm a believer anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: But boy, if anything shows that
mycorrhizal fungi is effective and is
[SPEAKER_05]: something that people oughta be using and
is cheap, boy, cannabis plant is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something you discovered,
mycorrhizal fungi?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm the one that discovered it,
but mycorrhizal fungi leads me to what I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: excited about, because there are a couple
of other things coming online,
[SPEAKER_05]: one of them are endophytic fungi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, mycorrhizal fungi generally,
99% of them are below ground, associated
[SPEAKER_05]: with roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Endophytic fungi are above ground,
and there are up to 350, 450 endophytic
[SPEAKER_05]: fungi in that plant right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not symbiotic, but they do various
different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them prevents cattle and aphids
from eating on plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're learning how to make those,
and so now there are a couple of
[SPEAKER_05]: endophytic fungi that people are
experimenting with that are gonna come on
[SPEAKER_05]: the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a fungi that I found that they
have in India.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't wanna get too much further,
but it looks to me like it acts like a
[SPEAKER_05]: mycorrhizal fungi, even though it isn't,
and so it might supplement the existing
[SPEAKER_05]: four mycorrhizal fungi that we know affect
cannabis plants, and I think that's
[SPEAKER_05]: coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am certain that this company,
in addition to having a phosphorus base,
[SPEAKER_05]: is coming up with new material.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you wanna follow all of this stuff,
new stuff coming up all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's microbial, and the final thing
I'll say is that when you learn that
[SPEAKER_05]: companies like Bayer, again, I don't say
Bayer, because I want everybody to
[SPEAKER_05]: remember that this wonderful company that
just purchased that terrific company,
[SPEAKER_05]: Monsanto, may have made some gases for a
shower back during World War II in the
[SPEAKER_05]: concentration camp.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, they are testing a microbial
nitrogen-fixing seed coating, a microbial
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen coating that fixes, not by making
nodules with the roots, but just free
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen out of the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all doing it, and they're doing it
because, not because they're smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, but I think they're watching us,
and they're figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're certainly figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know Scott's mural bro is trying to
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you, Colin?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's something that you've learned
recently or gotten into that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: excited about, if you can tell us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I mean, I think as a microbiologist
and basically a biotech company,
[SPEAKER_01]: a spinoff from the university,
I think about the same things I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: about the university.
[SPEAKER_01]: My roles changed quite a bit from that of
research scientist because I'm running the
[SPEAKER_01]: company and doing a lot of discovery,
kind of touring the world in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: One grow at a time, one grow shop at a
time, and that's my life right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think overall, I think also about how we
continue to bring value to growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always been my job, bringing value
to agriculture, bringing value to
[SPEAKER_01]: producers and growers, and my focus is on
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this industry is evolving into a
very professional, almost a commodity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's going to continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I want to make an impact is continue
to figure out where there's pain points
[SPEAKER_01]: and find natural solutions for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of opportunities to
continue to enhance yield and quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant and other crops, and my focus
is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We reinvest everything into our company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an R&D team of about 35% of the
company, and all we do is think about ways
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can make new natural technologies
that will bring value to growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my job, and to make sure I can
scale that where not only an office worker
[SPEAKER_01]: can use it, but a large-scale commercial
worker can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's economic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to bring that value to a
return.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that I think
about, not only on the nutrient liberation
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked a lot about how as we
liberate and deliver nutrients effectively
[SPEAKER_01]: to plants and allow plants to maximize
nutrient uptake, we can improve quality
[SPEAKER_01]: and yield, and that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also talk about the challenges of
biocontrol or pests, and how we can bring
[SPEAKER_01]: natural solutions because there's a lot of
problems across the world with using
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical solutions right now to control
pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a product standpoint, that's what
we look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nutrient delivery and control.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on those solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think from another aspect, and I think
I'm really excited about this industry as
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole, I just recently got back from
Germany, and I've been in Spain,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we got product here in the UK,
and I was in Israel, spent a lot of time
[SPEAKER_01]: in South America, and there's countries in
every continent that are passing
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, cultivation licenses,
and they're gearing towards the
[SPEAKER_01]: international distribution of
cannabis-related products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either flower or it's extracted
flower for hemp and CBD or for THC-related
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia is a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada is a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel is a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this industry is becoming global,
and I see this as a huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when it's going to convert
for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: where we can take advantage of that,
but on the federal level, I'll say if this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry was regulated, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: could lead the world in cannabis
production and exportation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited about it, although I don't
have a huge optimism about when that will
[SPEAKER_01]: occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a crystal ball that works for
that particular question, but I will say
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's a lot of opportunity,
not only in our states, which we're kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of limited to right now to a large degree,
but on this global scale, and the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the world is racing to occupy that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of very
opportunistic in general and very positive
[SPEAKER_01]: about that look of cannabis cultivators
and cannabis producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of opportunity to
continue to capture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to continue to push
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We left out a couple of other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Genetics, a tremendous amount of stuff
being done in genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of companies that are tracking
our genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you think you're growing isn't what
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lighting, unbelievable advances in
lighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're going to be able to do is
now take the lighting from the natural
[SPEAKER_05]: area.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to grow Durban poison,
which is South Africa, we can get the
[SPEAKER_05]: light profile from South Africa and
duplicate that in our grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty darn exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're going to be able to
duplicate in a sense some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: microbiology in a way that's kind of
exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: A paper just came out a couple months ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: They discovered there are 511 bacterial
types.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say individual bacteria,
but bacterial groups that exist any plant
[SPEAKER_05]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything they test, they find these 511.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, once we can identify those 511,
we can tell which ones are missing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to be able to tell which
ones we can add to that 511 to make them
[SPEAKER_05]: even more effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of this stuff is happening and it's
just, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To tag off that, the old Passover John,
I think what I like to talk about and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the talks I gave, I get to talk to a
lot of the shows is that I like to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that agriculture and growing is a team
sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do we have to work with our
community to learn and grow and share
[SPEAKER_01]: information, but technology change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to continue to be innovative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about using microbes and
innovative microbial technologies for this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are continually having to push the
envelope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Competition's fierce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in California and Oregon and
Washington right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Continuing to push technologies for life
and for environmental controls and
[SPEAKER_01]: different nutrient technologies and
coupling those with natural microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies is critical to remain
competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do we have to maximize our
output, but we have to minimize costs and
[SPEAKER_01]: our inputs and make sure there is
efficient as possible and that we get
[SPEAKER_01]: value out of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so thinking about that in the broader
picture, I think is a really valuable,
[SPEAKER_01]: umbrella thought to make sure that we're
continuing to push the envelope and
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing value to things that work really
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think microbes are a huge part of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not the only thing that anyone
should focus on to maximize the value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's workflow, which is a huge part
of it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things to consider in
cultivating.
[SPEAKER_04]: So back to you, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're an active researcher and
you're constantly learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's something that you've gotten into
recently that's gotten really exciting?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been researching and trialing out an
isolate of Metabuzumas sopilae,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a fungi that feeds on heart-child
insects, and a cordyceps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cordyceps is also the caterpillar
fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will feed on sopilic insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a combination of these two and
a kind of race to devour the insects that
[SPEAKER_02]: are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a life cycle with thrips
and different insects which go through the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil is the thing you want to save.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to be able to build up the
microbial community in that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mentioned before the USDA and how
they really gave, almost gave,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost be a bad name here in Albany.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, things have changed so much that
just a few years ago, they have
[SPEAKER_02]: researchers that are being funded to look
for potential insecticides that are also
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those is Metarysium brunium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got a patent on that here at
the USDA lab in Albany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're using that in golf courses
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if you know anything
about golf courses, but when I first went
[SPEAKER_02]: to a one-man cell food web lab,
I didn't know this myself, in Corvallis in
[SPEAKER_02]: 1998, where I met Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she asked the question, what is the
most dangerous job in the United States?
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And crab fishermen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these people said different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one said greenskeeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the greenskeeper, once they started
documenting the real workers at the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenskeeper, at greens and golf courses,
they found out that they spiked in
[SPEAKER_02]: cancers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that became the most dangerous job in
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, all the greens are near
wetland.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good to see and exciting to be
part of the collaboration that's going on
[SPEAKER_02]: between, I guess, mainstream now and
cannabis in order to be able to protect
[SPEAKER_02]: the wetlands, protect the forests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got about 10 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go ahead and get a couple of your
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just mention something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a couple of months ago, a lady called
me up with a doctor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she had a little gadget that measures
microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you heard about this yet?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Write this down, folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: www.microbiomeater.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a kit you buy, $150.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you take the test out in your
field on your soil or on a product that
[SPEAKER_05]: you buy to determine what the microbial
biomass is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what this lady wants folks to do in
the community is to test the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, when your plants start to
flower, they stop producing the amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: exudase that they produce in order to get
to that stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can tell with this microbiome
meter when that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can tell when you're thinking about
the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we're going to be able to have
growers test and determine what's
[SPEAKER_05]: happening in their grow by using this
little $5 or $10 test.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which you can do in five minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to send it in to the soil
food web.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm not saying don't use the soil
food web test, because you need that as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is something you can do very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tell you whether what you're doing
is working, which I think is key,
[SPEAKER_05]: because we all need to be experimenting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're handing it to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're handing it to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you tell him that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just spent $30 grand on a new QPCR.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that helps too.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Tate with Keen Life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am also selling some microbial products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the biggest questions that I
often get, I know the answer to it,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'd like to hear your gentleman
opinion, is, OK, so if I'm using these
[SPEAKER_06]: microbes, aren't I going to fail microbial
testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your answer to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it depends what state you're in or
county you're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in Oregon, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a choice between testing for
insecticides and fungicides or the more
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they decided, microbiology isn't that
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, that's a calling question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Colorado is one of the strictest
sets of microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and Nevada's even stricter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually talking about that last
night on a podcast with Subcool and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these other guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a problem, and those guys are in
those states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to a large degree,
the failing's occurring, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those more desert areas,
because dust lands on the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: These flowers are particularly sticky,
and dust is vectors for microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can actually fail through
natural windblown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a really interesting
challenge, especially in deserts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really restricted growers in
Nevada, in particular, to grow indoors
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of using the greenhouses because
of dustblown, which is a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I will say, and I asked this
question, and we tested this pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: rigorously on our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some farms in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow really high CD strains,
and we're getting some licenses for some
[SPEAKER_01]: medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll hire THC strains as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strictly for agricultural purposes,
we can do stuff with that end product and
[SPEAKER_01]: get it to medical facilities for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then today, this is about agronomics
for me, more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we apply, it depends on how you apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: For manna, we recommend using microbes as
a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've tested this really rigorously.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's almost impossible for the
microbes and these pre-living bacteria in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, and fungi, to translocate from
the roots and soil up through and land in
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower is what's getting tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't see a concern about that at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little more hesitant to tell growers
to apply mammoth, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a foliar, because you're actually
engineering higher CFUs or colony forming
[SPEAKER_01]: units of bacteria on the flower if you're
spraying that on a flower, which I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to use a foliar, I would
recommend using a microbial foliar early
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bench cycle or very early in the
bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not actually physically adding
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's definitely trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very, very confident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to some really sophisticated
researchers in Austria also who are trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to get microbes to translocate from the
roots or on the seed coating into the
[SPEAKER_01]: final flower product as a biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're really smart researchers,
and they can't make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's just thinking about
how that microbes landing on the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: relating that to your management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think any microbes in soiled ranches
is not a threat.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I've always came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that I've always seen was
testing for aspergillus and a lot of these
[SPEAKER_06]: other yeast and mold compounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in that particular style of testing,
obviously, you're going to have a lot more
[SPEAKER_06]: contamination in the foliar feed than in a
root zone feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, air quality tests are
pretty typical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they test for those spore counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those spore forming fungi in
particular aren't airborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: They blur.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're breathing in spores right now as we
talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: You breathe like 3,000 a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just a natural occurrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think not only understanding the
environmental quality of your air when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing, it helps you inform that
threat in your growing environment for
[SPEAKER_01]: those tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's another piece which is a
slower process, but it's about educating
[SPEAKER_01]: and understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, VT is an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viscillus thuringiensis has been used as a
biocontrol forever, you know, for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time by huge companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would test negative if you had
high enough concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a harm with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So educating regulators to have that
personal understanding what a good microbe
[SPEAKER_01]: is from a bad microbe, quote unquote,
is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's still a challenge for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, next question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to say, you know,
I said in Oregon, gee, what is that white
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff on the outside of the pinot noir
grape?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get the emphasis on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think we're going to get the
capability at some point in time to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to do, even at home, RNA and DNA
testing ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it's coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: And before it comes to the home,
I hope these idiot regulators get the
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment and can identify what the stuff
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we know what the DNA is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the testing becomes legitimate as
opposed to harassment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And employee-based, I have a job.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason that I bring it up is that so
many people are becoming negatively
[SPEAKER_06]: stigmatized for microbes because of this
microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's big for California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and incidentally, in Denver,
aren't they thinking about doing a
[SPEAKER_05]: radioactive implant into plants that are
tested so that you can tell that your
[SPEAKER_05]: plant's been tested?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's got the radioactive marker on
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I
[SPEAKER_03]: have a couple questions from the practical
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I go on a consultation,
it's not hard for me to go out and tell
[SPEAKER_03]: people that these things work,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really the ability to quantify to
them on a spreadsheet, what are they going
[SPEAKER_03]: to get out of the value that you can
provide?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I come at them and I say,
over the next 52 weeks, you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have to spend $30,000 on natural to get
rid of your natural, or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they go, oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do want to get rid of our problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't have the funds for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't have an existing budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you combat, specifically Colin,
how do you combat that as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you combat that when you're having
that meeting, and they know that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: bring something, but we don't have the
budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just we can't do it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe next quarter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get paid a retainer five minutes after
that conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then consult one of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just throw it on our table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Colin answers questions freely all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so does Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make you look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a really changing game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I did say Oregon, they don't have
any microbial screening on their flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they just started microbial screening
on their products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's someplace where they can
make money instantly when you get fined
[SPEAKER_02]: for not having a certain level of CFUs of
a certain, let's say, this little subtlest
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have on your label.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're building up their QPCR
capabilities so that they can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: tell what these different organisms are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be able to tell beneficials from
harmful ones on flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of answers the show's question
over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your question, well, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of people with a lot
of hard money out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're looking at what they're
getting now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they see that they've fallen very far
short.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they want to cut something out of
the budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they want to use some salt
formula that's so cheap, you could buy it
[SPEAKER_02]: at Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cheapest soil in order to be able
to just get something out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your product will be so substandard,
it will be really difficult to sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even with substandard fertilizers,
my program or a compost tea program is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to enhance some of the quality in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing how adaptive this plant is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing up in Northern California,
I've been watching it since 1978.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you that the enforcement
actually increased the adaptability and
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the helicopters started getting lower
and people moved back towards the forest,
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize this because I was young
at the time, which kind of got my interest
[SPEAKER_02]: in microbiology later, is that there's a
lot of microorganisms that are on the bark
[SPEAKER_02]: in a lichen that came down onto the plants
and started to modify the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They modified it because, of course,
the people that were breeders started
[SPEAKER_02]: selecting plants that were adapting
because they were looking better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back to my point of they will see a
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were sitting here earlier when
I said the difference could even be on the
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 meter, you've got to show them they're
saving money somewhere and they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: forward with a program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people that are in it to win it
are plant breeders now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to have a certain section of
that area that you're working in,
[SPEAKER_02]: either bringing in the latest gelato
strain or being able to feed plants
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I just answered your
question or just really straight from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be here over time anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kyle, do you want to hit that real quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think you need to quantify,
and it's a math equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to display a return.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think any farmer in any industry,
in any crop, can afford to bring something
[SPEAKER_01]: in to pay for something that they're not
going to get that return on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can quantify any return.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might take time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always data driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can show that cost of that pest
over time that they're not mitigating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can show it in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can show it in CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can mitigate that with lighting
effects and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the way you can quantify and show a
return, if you can do that, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: compelling, you have a compelling value to
offer these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, scare them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell them they're leaving money on the
table.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got to give up the room for the
next event.
[SPEAKER_04]: But John, Jeff, and Colin are going to be
hanging out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that I saw at least six or seven
more hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've heard questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, let's wrap this up and thank
our panelists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Do you guys want to take a photograph?
Yeah, please.
