[SPEAKER_02]: So Jeff, you know, last night when you
were talking, I heard something that I had
[SPEAKER_02]: never really considered before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that I can't be the only one who
has a history of going to the grow shop
[SPEAKER_02]: and buying nutrients with the highest
numbers because, you know, as far as NPK
[SPEAKER_02]: goes, because it feels like it's the most
bang for the buck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like, like I want to get the most
nutrient possible for my money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But last night you said that in actuality
you recommend purchasing lower numbers
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's overall going to be better
for the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you break that out a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, yesterday I was talking about
auto flowers, but it applies to all plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and not just cannabis plants, as far as
I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the tendency is to want to go
get the highest nitrogen you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that first number in the NPK
trilogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all been inundated over the years
with television ads and television ads and
[SPEAKER_00]: television ads about how that high
nitrogen number is going to make the green
[SPEAKER_00]: lawn and gorgeous green plants and it's
going to make things grow fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're all accustomed to the idea
that you want to have that high number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, comes the hydroponic
people who say, oh, OK, look at this,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think people sit back and
think of a number of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me first start by explaining you're
not feeding the plant when you're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're feeding the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those microbes will then feed the plant
through the cycling of their bodies and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in their bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're feeding the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a food that the microbes
are going to be able to digest and eat
[SPEAKER_00]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have something that just
one kind of microbe wants or that impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: the diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to have something,
obviously, that contains more than just
[SPEAKER_00]: NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go for the lower numbers and I go for
the micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lower numbers I'm talking about,
things like three, four, three,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a number over the middle
numbers, the phosphorus number,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that number is over 50 parts per
million, somehow I think that equates to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically like a 10 or a 12 in that middle
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a 10, 12 would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That middle number, if it's that high,
provides enough phosphorus so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi, which would normally go
out and get the phosphorus for the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant says, I don't need to feed these
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting phosphorus for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it changes either the signaling or
the action.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes everybody lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the plant appreciate the free
lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it makes not so much lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the plant just not attract to the
rhizosphere of those microbes that would
[SPEAKER_00]: normally be there because it doesn't need
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you have to supply those until
the plant stops doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you put in that high number for
phosphorus, the plant just stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense if you want to have a
good healthy soil food web to feed the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, not the plant, and to not become
a microbe yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens when you use those
high numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kill off some of the members of the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to become them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the plant doesn't eat,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at some of these packages,
I won't mention the evil people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at their package,
you've got to reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stuff every two weeks,
every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've destroyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you created this artificial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant says, I don't need to
support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to attract these microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's forget the concept that in some
instances, these high nitrogen fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: and high MPK will actually change the
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a serious problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some instances, it will actually kill
off the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some instances, it increases one kind
of microbe, because they eat this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you really want to have a nice,
balanced, even system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the microbes to do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have the plant make a
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to have it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea that our job as farmers
is really to take care of the microbe
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the microbe community takes care of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was first getting into organic
food, I was a serious follower of Joel
[SPEAKER_02]: Saladin from Holly Face Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of his things, he says,
I'm not a cattle and chicken farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a grass farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so long as I produce good grass,
then all the animals eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, we're trying to create good
microbes so that the plant has something
[SPEAKER_02]: that it wants to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're herders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're herders.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're ranchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we forget it is because
before World War II, that's all people
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of a sudden, these artificial
fertilizers came in after the war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do they come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Munitions, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just one of those systems that got
out of hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you talk about it,
to go back to the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: question, your concentration levels,
you thought, gee, I'll buy those higher
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cheaper, ultimately, in terms of the
economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not really true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have to apply more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your plant is probably more
susceptible to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it doesn't have the micro
community to help it fend off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you change the diversity,
then you're really screwing things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to pay attention to what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, when you buy these things,
you might want to think about where,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's see, if I part compost, the compost
is made out of manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it come from a cow or the cow eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to buy the stuff that the
cow eats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all sorts of ways of thinking
different about this, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember that TV commercial, NPK.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question about the NPK numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very often, we will want to use soil
additives of several different types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've all got their own NPK numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you think about stacking those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we add them together, and suddenly now
we've got an NPK number?
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 of 18, because we've used five
different things that are three?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I tried to understand these
moles, percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, god, it's so confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the NPK numbers themselves don't
really represent nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phosphorus is really not phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all I know is that when you do mix
them together, you are additive as opposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to subtractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're increasing the number as you
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it's sort of one of these
situations where you've got to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're giving the plant what it
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what a lot of people do is just
knee-jerk apply these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say the other part of the
question should be, or the answer should
[SPEAKER_00]: be, you need to test to see what your
plant really needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people don't do any testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really are deficient in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many neat ways to test
that, from saw food web, microbiometer,
[SPEAKER_00]: NPK, it's all good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ought to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Information's power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see if we can go back and
summarize the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep those numbers low,
because you're feeding the microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: not feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: By keeping the numbers low, you keep that
microbe set healthy, and the plant does
[SPEAKER_00]: not rely on the food you're applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still relying on the microbe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
