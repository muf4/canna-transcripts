[SPEAKER_00]: It is taken for granted nowadays that
healthy soil is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ground we walk on is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was not the case just 40 years
ago when Western agriculture thought of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil more like an inert robot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil food web methodology describes
the community of organisms living all or
[SPEAKER_00]: part of their lives in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It describes a complex living system in
the soil and how it interacts with the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, plants, and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It describes the web of life from large
animals all the way down to the most basic
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiological level in soil and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to grok the soil food
web in an instant, do an image search
[SPEAKER_00]: online for soil food web and see any of
the incredible illustrations that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or check out the Shaping Fire Instagram
today for one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil food web is at the very core of
regenerative agriculture and not only will
[SPEAKER_00]: inform your cultivation efforts to help
your plants thrive, but it will inform
[SPEAKER_00]: humanity and how we may heal our planet
before we make it uninhabitable for
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn about cannabis
health, cultivation, and technique

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is soil biologist,
educator and activist, Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ingham uncovered the soil food web
nearly four decades ago and has been
[SPEAKER_00]: pioneering research about soil food web
ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Widely recognized as the world's foremost
soil biologist, she's passionate about
[SPEAKER_00]: empowering people to bring the soils in
their communities back to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, be clear when I say that Dr. Ingham
uncovered the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I mean is she invented the
soil food web or rather the soil food web
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of nature and then continued
to research it and teach it even though
[SPEAKER_00]: she was getting aggressive pushback from
the agriculture industry, which
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially made her an activist too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply for trying to publicly describe how
soil actually functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Elaine's soil food web approach has
been used to successfully restore the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological functions of soil soils on more
than five million acres of farmland all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her professional scientific experience is
long and impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to know it in detail,
check out the Wikipedia page about her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Elaine has also established the soil
food web school to educate the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation of soil biologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: The courses offered have been designed for
people with or without a science
[SPEAKER_00]: background, making them accessible to
individuals who wish to learn and to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: a meaningful and truly impactful career in
an area that will help to secure the
[SPEAKER_00]: survival of humans and other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have wanted to invite Elaine to be
special guest on Shaping Fire for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years now, but decided to wait until I had
enough understanding of soil biology to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask her questions that would be of
interest to you, the listener,
[SPEAKER_00]: and would be engaging for Dr. Ingham too.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a Shaping Fire listener, you've learned
soil science right alongside me the last
[SPEAKER_00]: five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna love today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Ingham says she does too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's episode is not an introduction to
the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this perspective is new to you,
when you're done here, I recommend you
[SPEAKER_00]: jump over to YouTube for one of the many
videos that explain the basics of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: food web model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's episode is a series of discussion
lines that have arisen from me actually
[SPEAKER_00]: using the soil food web insights to grow
cannabis and my discussions with other
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we discussed the use
of indigenous microorganisms to optimize
[SPEAKER_00]: plant resilience and the overlap between
the soil food web and the water food web
[SPEAKER_00]: and what that means for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second set, we talk about sterile
growing environments, beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_00]: as both garden defense and food web
antagonist, and how to get coco coir pots
[SPEAKER_00]: as biologically active as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, we finished the episode in set
three with a discussion of the timeline
[SPEAKER_00]: and the use of aerated compost teas and
compost extracts and bringing the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: food web techniques indoors for
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Dr. Elaine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gonna be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm so glad to finally have you on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, many of us aspire to
strengthen every level of the soil food
[SPEAKER_00]: web in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we can most effectively play
its melody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this often includes the use of
incubated indigenous microorganisms known
[SPEAKER_00]: by most folks as IMOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis plants are not indigenous to
many of the regions of the world where we
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there ways to make the cannabis plants
feel more at home in the environments
[SPEAKER_00]: where naturally they never establish
themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how can we make non-indigenous
plants that we grow connect more fully
[SPEAKER_00]: with the local biology?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually doing a really good job of
doing that already.
[SPEAKER_01]: The damage that we do to our soil when we
till it, when we put out these salts,
[SPEAKER_01]: the inorganic fertilizers are all salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's definitely plain havoc with
those microorganisms that might have
[SPEAKER_01]: prevented cannabis from being able to grow
in their particular system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're already doing the things to a
great deal that would allow or would,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, select for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so as human beings change
things, we alter, we are making a better
[SPEAKER_01]: and better environment for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're already making things better
to grow cannabis because it is a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that needs somewhere between like a 0.5
ratio of fungi to bacteria up to maybe 1
[SPEAKER_01]: to 1 equal biomass of bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are values that we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, does cannabis need at least 135
micrograms of bacteria and fungi?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or can it's going to, is it actually going
to do better if we have a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bacteria are up at 400 micrograms
per gram, whereas the fungi are at half
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, even less than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And will the impact on the species or the
subspecies of cannabis that you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we're already doing everything
necessary to grow cannabis all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your answer is surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I understand it correctly,
disheartening, because what I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: just said is because we are eroding the
strength of our soil globally,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has less defense mechanisms and is
therefore creating a wider environment for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because we're destroying the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is that about what you said?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really basically what I said.
Gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great for cannabis growers, but not so
great if you want to be growing grapevines
[SPEAKER_01]: or shrubs or different kinds of,
you know, highly productive grass species,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or, or, you know, food that has
nutrition and all the other things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to slightly change the
question then to tease out something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so even though we humans by eroding
and degrading the soil are actually making
[SPEAKER_00]: it more appropriate for cannabis,
when we do move, when we do bring cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into areas where perhaps the
weather is something that they're not used
[SPEAKER_00]: to, or the indigenous microorganisms are
not what they're used to, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: there is eroded soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're getting the, you know,
the, the pH and the parts per million that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be more appropriate for cannabis
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other things that we can do to
decrease, you know, weather and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and transport shock for plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so often cultivators are moving
their plants multiple times from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from a, from a nursery to a grow,
grow out greenhouse, and then finally into
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And absolutely, I think there would be
things we could do to make it easier on
[SPEAKER_01]: the specific plants in that process of
dealing a root, with a root system that's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we really want to do is give it depth
because properly grown out in the real
[SPEAKER_01]: world, cannabis usually will broaden those
root systems, will be you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: certain diameter from around those,
around the main stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then those roots tend to grow,
should grow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking for water that,
that they have to have in the dry seasons
[SPEAKER_01]: of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if they've got proper structure
built in the soil, if they have the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterium fungi present, that will build
that kind of structure, the protozoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: the nematodes that will help to build that
structure, then the roots of your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: will go down quite deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we see cannabis with root
systems down at 12 feet, 15 feet,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 feet, depending I'm, I think on the
cultivars, the type of cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're thinking about transferring
from something that grew up in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, little, the small containers in
the greenhouse, and now we're going to put
[SPEAKER_01]: them into larger containers, it's not
diameter of the container that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: think about, it's the height of the
growing, the container that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be growing that cannabis in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we want to mimic, we want to have
things be more like those plants are used
[SPEAKER_01]: to out in the real world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a drive to get those root
systems deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure almost everybody is, you know,
when they've pulled up a cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they look at the bottom, and they see
the roots just going in circles against
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom of the pot, that is not good
for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have developed typically, have
developed an anaerobic condition in those
[SPEAKER_01]: root systems trying to escape,
trying to get down and deeper into the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've made an anaerobic little cubby area
that will grow diseased and pests
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly well, not going to grow the
right sets of microorganisms for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis root systems, obligately aerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to have oxygen in there or
they're going to succumb to a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: different stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly growing in the earth is best so
that those roots can reach far and
[SPEAKER_00]: participate in whatever's happening in the
soil food web at that depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus get their own water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that we can do as
growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so many of us grow in containers
that might be somewhere between 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 or up to 300 gallon pots, but they
still don't go very deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually expand out wider instead of
getting deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is there anything that we can do to
help the roots from becoming anaerobic at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, anything as simple as making
sure to use linen pots, which let some air
[SPEAKER_00]: go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that we can do out of
that bad situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get the food web into that soil such
that there's a lot of nutrient cycling,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of protection, there's a lot
of building structures, so water is held
[SPEAKER_01]: right at the top of that interface going
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant is getting all the things it
needs from a shallower pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could maybe reduce that stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so trying some of this out and finding
out, okay, how wide does something have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be versus the depth that it's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just research that hasn't been
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a number of labs have said,
oh yeah, we should do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't seen any data back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a while since I've actually
been growing any cannabis, just too many
[SPEAKER_01]: other things happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what you said about, you know,
we will help the root system out by making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure it's participating as much in the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just briefly on the last episode,
I spoke with one of your students,
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy Marsh, and she was talking about,
you know, biological inoculants,
[SPEAKER_00]: not of particular nutrition, but of
residents of the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have, you know, any suggestions for
inoculating our soil with actual,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, living beings instead of just
nutrition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's really what we're talking
about when we're discussing soil biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the organisms going, it's the living
part of that soil that we're concerned
[SPEAKER_01]: about because it's the living organisms,
those things doing their jobs,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you don't have to do them, is really
what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to understand the function of all
these different microorganisms in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, most people have a hard
time believing that there's that many
[SPEAKER_01]: species of bacteria and species of fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in both cases, bacteria and fungi,
we're up in the, millions, hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of individual species,
and they're different in different
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to obtain a community of
bacteria and of fungi and of protozoa and
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want them all to be good guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know some people cringe when I don't
use technical scientific terms,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it makes more sense to say,
we want the beneficials that will help
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant grow, and where are you going
to go out there and find them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And find them for the biome that you're
already living in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someday that cannabis plant is going to be
planted outside, and it's going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with the conditions of a normal
summer in whatever part of the world
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you want to make certain that the
maximum protection from the species,
[SPEAKER_01]: subspecies of bacteria and fungi and
protozoa and nematodes and microarthropods
[SPEAKER_01]: and earthworms and incotreids,
and I could keep going, but I lose most
[SPEAKER_01]: people typically about in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute, I didn't know there were
that many different types of, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant needs them all to do the jobs
that you otherwise are going to get stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: doing if you don't have your willing
organic workers in that soil for your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to maximize diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have you go out into the
area around where you're living,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're going to be planting the
cannabis for those cannabis that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to display the particular flavors or
tastes, what all is going to be in that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to maximize the
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you go out with your collection bag,
and it doesn't have to be real large.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a little Ziploc sandwich size
or, you know, quart size baggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to take two or three
pinches of this area right around this
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This looks like it could be really
interesting, so let's put some of that in
[SPEAKER_01]: there because that could be really
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's go over here and take a couple
of teaspoonfuls and go over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time you see variation,
different plants, different
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms, you know, most people
don't understand that a mushroom is
[SPEAKER_01]: individual strands of fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_01]: The individual strands you cannot see with
your eyes, but that mushroom you
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely will be able to see with your
eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might want to make certain that
you know who the good guy mushrooms are
[SPEAKER_01]: and take samples from around their
connection with the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And leave alone the things, the
armillarias, the things that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens or pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit of studying up on what are
the good guys and what are the bad guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can determine based just on
morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're going to be out collecting a
lot of materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, do you collect those in the
springtime or in the summer or in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fall?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer to that is yes, because it's
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'll be different sets of species
that are awake and functioning at
[SPEAKER_01]: different times of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to get them all inoculated
into your compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let those organisms grow up that
are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep our compost piles aerobic because
that selects for mostly just the
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the disease causers, the problem
organisms, they like to be there in the
[SPEAKER_01]: root bound pot because it's perfect with
that low oxygen concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we keep that soil well structured by
bacteria and fungi and protozoan nematodes
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything else, making hallways and
passageways and building condominium
[SPEAKER_01]: housing, building large hotels,
building large structures in the soil so
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen can move through very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water infiltrates and gets held in that
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never allow leaching to occur because
you need all those nutrients, either in a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of weeks or maybe in another month
or maybe next spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to make sure we're holding on
to all of these things by making sure we
[SPEAKER_01]: have a huge diversity of all the organisms
that grow in the springtime, all the
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms that grow in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're fairly different, what is
actually growing and functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they take over functions that somebody
else was doing in the soil, but they did
[SPEAKER_01]: the work better at 15 degrees Fahrenheit
or 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you go through changes in
temperature and moisture, oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations, all of those things,
you want to make sure you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms that will be there to do the
jobs for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So making certain that you're inoculating
indigenous local things, it is just
[SPEAKER_01]: laughable to have somebody hand you a jug
of bugs and say, these are the best
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms we've ever found in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That who is regarding those five species
in there as being the best according to
[SPEAKER_01]: what set of conditions and considerations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they best at taking up carbon dioxide?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they best at taking up nitrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they the best at making ammonium?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does your plant need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis needs a balance, pretty much an
equal balance of ammonium and nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want an equal amount of biomass
of bacteria as of fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we get talking a little bit
later, I'll bring up the subject of
[SPEAKER_01]: succession, because that's going to be a
big determinant of what you're going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with different kinds of cannabis to get
the product that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two follow-ups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask them at the same time,
because I have a feeling that you are
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to weave them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first follow-up is we're big fans of
having biologically active compost piles
[SPEAKER_00]: here to pull from for all sorts of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also know that my brethren in
cannabis love to cut corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can very much imagine cultivators
taking the collected inoculant and,
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of putting it into their compost
pile, instead just putting it right into
[SPEAKER_00]: their containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my first part of the question is,
is there a specific benefit to inoculating
[SPEAKER_00]: the compost pile first, even though the
process is going to take longer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a real extra win for having it be
in the compost pile first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second, after you do the
collection, but before you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation, do you recommend just taking
the collected matter and just taking it
[SPEAKER_00]: over to your compost pile and just place
it in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you recommend an oxygen incubation,
like with an aerated tea, to kind of build
[SPEAKER_00]: up the population first?
[SPEAKER_01]: We mostly put the organisms directly into
the compost pile, because while we want
[SPEAKER_01]: active organisms, we want to constrain the
conditions in that pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're selecting for just the
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't ever want your pile to go
anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The instant you start to smell bad smells
coming out of that pile or funky kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the ammonia smell, the rotten egg kind of
smell mixed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you describe that?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know by smelling it that
something's going anaerobic in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that means you have to turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get oxygen in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't gotten up to 131 degrees
Fahrenheit for a full three days,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you've got to kind of eke along,
because you really don't want to turn it
[SPEAKER_01]: until you've gotten that preventative kind
of medicine for the bad guys are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get killed by the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also want to make sure there's no
anaerobic conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you might do there where you can,
this is smelling, it's only day two and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to wait till day three to turn
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hasn't been hot enough long enough to kill
the human pathogens, plant pathogens,
[SPEAKER_01]: yada yada yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you'll do instead is take like a PVC
pipe or a metal rod, you know not a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: thickness to the hole maker and you're
going to take that and push it down
[SPEAKER_01]: through your compost pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull it back up because that's going to
leave a hole all the way down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of your compost pile, bringing
oxygen back into the system without
[SPEAKER_01]: turning the whole pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you've gotten to 131, over 131
degrees Fahrenheit or 55 degrees Celsius,
[SPEAKER_01]: for three days, then you turn with the
pitchfork and get that all aerated up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a very specific way we take
the hot middle and put it on the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pile when you start to turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was in the cold top part of the
pile, it goes into the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the part of the pile that's
going to have killing the disease-causing
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for part two and then the bottom part
of the first pile goes on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you always turn in the same fashion
so you know everything in your pile has
[SPEAKER_01]: been in the hot middle for more than
adequate periods of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't turn because of
temperature considerations, you get the
[SPEAKER_01]: PVC pipe or the pipe of the metallic pipe
and build yourself some chimneys.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many chimneys?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how fast you're getting hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where we always have people
running into trouble unless they take the
[SPEAKER_01]: foundation classes and learn how to make
good compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have hands-on classes that you can
take, as well as the virtual training that
[SPEAKER_01]: you get in the foundation courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always want to learn how to turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go through all of the,
well, why do we look at the recipe for the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're selecting for those organisms that
are going to best promote the plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing in that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always we want to, you know,
always want to make certain that the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost doesn't have any diseases or
pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to go through that step
because there's no other way to kill all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those bad guys, especially if you've
got manure of any kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that's been around an animal for
a short period of time or a long period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot be growing something that,
you know, you might be lighting up and
[SPEAKER_01]: licking the plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprise!
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a disease on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to take care of that problem
before we ever put it out on our property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building compost is one of those things
that, you know, my dad always said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, learn from your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can, learn from someone else's
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a big proponent of people actually
taking formal compost classes because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of the activity we can't
see, a lot of it is not intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can destroy your own work in
simple ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is something to actually take
a class in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The road to hell is, you know,
with my good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, paid by good intentions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first began studying the soil
food web after hearing you speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I definitely got the impact of,
you know, the model of understanding right
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started applying it and then,
you know, encouraging it in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then my mind was blown away a second
time coming across folks talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: water food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting because in your
brain, it's kind of like the same basic
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these were water loving creatures
instead of soil loving creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some biology probably loves both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I assume it would be a fallacy
to treat them separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'd like to know is how do you
think about the relationship between the
[SPEAKER_00]: water food web and the soil food web and
how they may overlap?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you still want the same nutrient
cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have root systems down
into the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why people always think
that, well, if your roots hit the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get to the water table, like your
roots can't go through the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we keep pouring on our plants in
order to get them to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's so terribly wrong about water?
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you keep it aerobic,
there is no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the root systems of your plants will
go right down through whatever water is
[SPEAKER_01]: present, get down into the sediments,
and then the root systems go into the
[SPEAKER_01]: sediments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sediments are just like yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're soil at a slightly higher percent
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to select for things that can
deal with that high water content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be some species that you
only find in, like when you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: rice, huge component while that field is
underwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will have quite a bit different sets
of microorganisms present.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you dry that surface out, those
microorganisms that require more than 50%
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture, more than 75% moisture,
they will all go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They form spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be present next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we get all the right sets of
microorganisms back into the soil in a
[SPEAKER_01]: water system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to make compost where
we're going to have a pretty wet and soppy
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do exactly what we do with
terrestrial systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be doing with plants that are more
aquatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have to recognize the needs of
your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does your plant do best?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it like it with the moisture fairly
low, moisture kind of medium, or fairly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're going into the pond here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to have to do some of
that testing probably yourself because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not something that in the world of
understanding landscapes, we haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: really paid enough attention to this water
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much water is normal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's normal to be at this level in
the springtime and then it dries down a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit and then it's completely dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just before harvest, which makes
things harvesting much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's another argument for
being sure to collect, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: local indigenous microbes too,
because if you are collecting from many
[SPEAKER_00]: different locations on your parcel and you
are building them into your compost pile
[SPEAKER_00]: at different times of year, it means that
you're collecting them, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I live, it rains for a vast part of
the year, but my growing season,
[SPEAKER_00]: we turn to drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I want my soil to, you know,
come into the drought season already being
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and then be able to make the
transition to a drier environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: that seems to suggest that I would want
year round microorganisms collected so
[SPEAKER_00]: that my soil is, you know, jam packed full
of flexible microorganisms that can play
[SPEAKER_00]: that on off around the calendar where
these folks go to sleep when these wake up
[SPEAKER_00]: and then these other ones go to sleep in
the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have this gentle seasonal back
and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all part of the biodiversity we
have to establish right from the very
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite things and I'm probably
going to paraphrase you poorly,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that I found very
inspiring when I first heard you speak was
[SPEAKER_00]: you were talking about the beginning of
the soil as like this threshold point
[SPEAKER_00]: between the sky and the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all comes like right down there to
where we stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really kind of shifted my
perspective for how big these two halves
[SPEAKER_00]: are, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to focus on an inch and a half of
the soil food web, that inch and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: right above the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many cultivators choose to grow tiny,
you know, one to three inch companion
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with like a single leaf or two
leaves to create a short, dense canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: over the soil surrounding the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about using Dichondra repens a lot
here on Shaping Fire as an example of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The multitude of roots and the root
exudates make for a rich and dynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those downward pathways of all those
little plants, you know, create a place
[SPEAKER_00]: for the water to seep through so that we
can avoid becoming hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, all that exudate
conversation is really great too.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question for you is this, what sort of
life happens in that little space between
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy, you know, an inch and a half,
two or three inches above the soil and the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, that inch and a half of bio region,
there's moisture held in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: like who's living there and what
biological processes are happening in that
[SPEAKER_00]: small area?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would really encourage you to start
looking at some of your soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: digging down and trying to find out where
these different layers are.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're in an old growth forest,
because you don't really have,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if it's not a very healthy
forest, you don't have anything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to mix that organic matter layer
down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very harmful for most of our
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: To not have some kind of mixing movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, again, where the
microorganisms are going to come into
[SPEAKER_01]: play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're going to be moving that
organic matter as it's decomposing and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into smaller and smaller bits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you're going to have microorganisms
taking that away to build structure with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not the top one to one to 1.5
depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to see that organic material
moving down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that o-horizon, or the intermediate
between the organic layer and the first
[SPEAKER_01]: layer of true soil, where you've got sand,
silt and clay present, as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter, you want the root system
growing down through all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't stop, if you're a root,
you don't stop there either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the root systems are going to keep on
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your roots are stopping at 1.5 inches
or centimeters into the soil, you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is deadly when it comes to growing
plants that are going to have all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic characteristics that we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good flavor, strong stem, resistant to
diseases and pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to have normal soil where those
root systems are going to keep growing
[SPEAKER_01]: straight down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't usually stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're healthy, they don't stop at 1.5
inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the roots themselves will be a part of
this contingent of moving materials from
[SPEAKER_01]: that organic matter layer down deeper and
deeper into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water moving along, taking the smaller
parts and particles down with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you develop a really good
a-horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if you've got a really good
a-horizon, then as you go deeper and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the small things stay up there at the
surface of the soil, the bigger chunks
[SPEAKER_01]: move down deeper into the soil b-horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you get deeper and lower than
that mixture, it's c-horizon, which most
[SPEAKER_01]: soils people look at as being sterile,
which it absolutely is not sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: How far down do the organisms in your soil
go?
[SPEAKER_01]: How far down do we see these bacteria,
fungi, protozoa, nematodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: microarthropods, earthworms, incotreids,
everything else?
[SPEAKER_01]: So 12 miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how deep the soil really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, your roots aren't going to be getting
down there, but all these roots and these
[SPEAKER_01]: really important factors are going on in
all of that 12 miles of soil that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got below the interface with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with plant roots, how far, if you're
looking at a Douglas fir, how far down
[SPEAKER_01]: into the soil can the roots go?
[SPEAKER_01]: As tall as a tree is above the surface of
the soil, so below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your Douglas fir is 200 feet tall,
the root system of the plant is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be about 200 feet down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great interface between the
atmosphere and what it's doing and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in the soil and the soil below
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of things I could go off on,
but yeah, I think that's probably complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: If our focus for this aspect is to make
sure that the organic material that is
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposing on the top of the soil is
finding its way down into the soil to be
[SPEAKER_00]: moved around by the superhighways,
is this a good case for why we would have
[SPEAKER_00]: a companion plant on top?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people use the term cover crop,
even though that's not exactly accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we grow these small plants as
companion plants and they create a one or
[SPEAKER_00]: a two leaf canopy two inches above the
soil, it creates this zone where I imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is going to be a lot of
biological life because there's moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: there and it's protected some from direct
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I imagine is that there are lots
of organisms that are processing the
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy compost that I put on top or
anything I've collected around the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that we put on top, the way it
gets into the soil would be improved if I
[SPEAKER_00]: have this canopy that creates this two
inch area above the soil, but below the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy where there can be active biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hear that, does that sound like
nature or is that just something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think sounds great?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got it almost right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably what you're not considering
here again is compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have those understory plants
that grow out and they may only be an inch
[SPEAKER_01]: tall, two inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what your crop plant is,
how tall your cover plants are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ground cover is another, that's the
word I was looking for a minute ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want just one species.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want just two because who's
going to survive next spring?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't tell you what the weather is
going to be, what it's going to be like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to maximize diversity right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep some of the things that cause maximum
diversity to stay in your system from now
[SPEAKER_01]: until forever as far as you're concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to prevent water drops falling
from the sky to directly impact on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface of your soil because you're
compacting all of those airways and
[SPEAKER_01]: passageways when that drop hits the
surface of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the major compacting problem that we
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: In agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's bad enough driving over your
soil with a big machinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: But big machinery can be constrained to
just two wheel rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rainfall, how are you going to get it to
fall in just one place?
[SPEAKER_01]: And imagine the damage that would be done
if it fell in just one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never considered rain as a compaction
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I understand better what you said
earlier about the depth of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The depth of the roots where these short
plants might be nice because they grow
[SPEAKER_00]: into this blanket that protects it from
compaction from the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I understand better that you're
also saying make sure you have a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants that are going to have deeper
roots like radishes or something so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a variety of root depths and a
variety of exudate conversation that's
[SPEAKER_00]: taking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really when you start looking at how
is it that having plants growing on that
[SPEAKER_01]: surface, short, low growing plants,
they're continuing to have nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: cycling going on all of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your plant ever suffers some harm,
the nutrient cycling is still going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still going to be hooked up to the
low ground system of mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: because everything in this orchard,
everything in your cannabis plot should be
[SPEAKER_01]: connected below ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not some of the kales and the coal
and those early successional plots,
[SPEAKER_01]: the weeds, those plants won't have the
mycorrhizal connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as you get past that where
we're looking at fungal to bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass ratio of upwards around 0.5 or
greater, they're all mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everything is tied together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want the surface protected by the leaf
material because when that drop of water
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts on a leaf, it pushes that leaf
down and the water gently rolls off that
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf surface and ends up in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've completely taken care of that
compacting effect and some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients are moving with that drop of
water into your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's lots of benefits in lots of
ways that you've got this continuous
[SPEAKER_01]: cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually these ground covers wake up and
start growing earlier than your crop
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now think about when do you transplant
your cannabis into the ground outside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not the day after the soil is
no longer frozen because most of the time
[SPEAKER_01]: none of us pay attention to how cold is
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how nasty is it going to be when I
have to be out there doing all this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's going to be a month later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you think of all that time where
those understory plants are getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil ready for whatever crop you're going
to be putting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of, you know,
you need to understand what your
[SPEAKER_01]: particular crop requires in terms of
fungal to bacterial biomass ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have that time to build the
fungal biomass if you're lacking in fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: or build the protozoan populations and the
good guy nematodes so that you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the things are being held and
stored and moved and built just exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the way they should.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want nice cover, not just here and
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want the best places where I'm seeing
the best coverage is where they have 20
[SPEAKER_01]: different species of seeds that have been
spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see where this summer up comes
these five species of ground cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really you don't see much of the other
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But next year, it's like none of the five
that were really important last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not even peeping their heads above
because things just are not right for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you want to have something that's
going to go, yay, this is perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll get five or six different
species showing their heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's always those years where
everything grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's spectacular when you look in your
garden is really what it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've got the rows of the plant
you're trying to grow for profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got all these understory plants
that are just peeking through the blades
[SPEAKER_01]: and showing their heads so that the
flowers are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of things to sit back and
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still trying to figure out a lot
of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always interesting to try to figure
out where does all this nitrogen come
[SPEAKER_01]: from?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a bumper crop amount of nitrogen
in our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go and try to analyze soluble
nitrogen, total nitrogen, exchangeable
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, there's a missing part of the
nitrogen cycle that we're not paying any
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people always do calculations of,
well, you couldn't possibly keep these
[SPEAKER_01]: 440,000 individual plants, you couldn't
possibly keep them alive and happy with
[SPEAKER_01]: really high levels of nitrogen in them if
you don't use inorganic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet all of our plants have much higher
levels of nitrogen than the chemically
[SPEAKER_01]: grown plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which one's going to give you better
flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one is going to give you more
nutrition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which ones are going to taste better?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some of this work that we've
still got, Mother Nature has not yet
[SPEAKER_01]: revealed all to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some more work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great time to be a young scientist
coming up into the system where you've
[SPEAKER_00]: broken the idea of the soil food web and
that even though it seems obvious now that
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil is alive, but now we also have
got the analytical technologies to take
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements and see what we're working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great time to be coming into
thinking about regenerative growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without these advertisers, Shaping Fire
wouldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_00]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be fun, sure, but so many
varieties in one pack is a sign of an
[SPEAKER_00]: immature seed line that hasn't been worked
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer my auto flowers to be worked
enough that each pheno in the pack really
[SPEAKER_00]: captures the aspects that the breeder was
intending.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I recommend gnome automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic flowering cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gnome automatic seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizable by its traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traits that were hard earned so that you
can have your best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last 10 years, gnome automatics
founder Dan Jimmy has become a trusted
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder and he continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_00]: variety he releases for you to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the gnome automatics Instagram
at gnome underscore automatics to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can score gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los and my guest
today is Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we were talking a lot
about the importance of encouraging and
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting the soil food web and making
sure all of the different plants in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden are talking with each other because
indeed we are looking to support a web of
[SPEAKER_00]: communication and transference of
nutrition and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Elaine, you know many cultivators
aspire to the soil food web ideals but
[SPEAKER_00]: they still get hung up on keeping sterile
growing environments like even outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of focusing on biology and
balance, they intend instead for like
[SPEAKER_00]: ideals like zero pest present,
like there's not a single pest in my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you teach the mindset of the soil
food web so that your students understand
[SPEAKER_00]: this softer idea of biological inclusion
in balance instead of the absolutist
[SPEAKER_00]: ideals of zero tolerance for anybody who
isn't on my team?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it's what we were all taught
when we were in grade school, middle
[SPEAKER_01]: school, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly in any microbiology class,
you know, what's the most dangerous thing
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to encounter today?
[SPEAKER_01]: The door handle on the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everybody touches it going in and
out, and not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like that's a special place for
disease-causing organisms to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just inoculating a lot of really
interesting things on that door handle,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're also inoculating all of the
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a balance there that you've
got to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got people with good,
decent, they've picked up their apple
[SPEAKER_01]: every day or they've picked up some really
good soil, smelled it, they're working in
[SPEAKER_01]: their compost pile, you don't have to
worry about the doorknob anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every morning, go out there and wipe all
of your doorknobs with a really good
[SPEAKER_01]: handful of compost that you know has got
all of the really beneficial organisms in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the mechanisms for why this is
important is that if you've got a sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: system, there's nothing to stop the
disease-causing organisms if, perchance,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get inoculated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so runs through your greenhouse,
all of the containers, all of the benches,
[SPEAKER_01]: below the benches, all the little spiders
and all the cute little buzzy little flies
[SPEAKER_01]: that drive us all crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did all of these aphids come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did these white flies come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it probably came because you're
being too sterile about things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not letting there be those things
that would wipe out those diseases and
[SPEAKER_01]: pests before they ever got to a high
enough concentration that it would start
[SPEAKER_01]: bothering us as human beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever we're looking to get rid of a
disease-causing organism, especially in a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse, is go in and look and see,
where might the spores be hanging out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to have a specific part
of the greenhouse, or if you're outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: a specific part of the soil, typically low
oxygen, lots of dead bodies of things and
[SPEAKER_01]: things for them to chow down on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those eggs or spores, when they hatch,
have all the food they need right around
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can very quickly move in to the
next stage of their life where those
[SPEAKER_01]: larval stages are moving off someplace
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they need the unclean ecosystems in
order to thrive and have each one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: larvae make it through to adulthood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the mom and dad, they're flying
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every place they touch is going to be a
mass of these disease-causing organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going out on the surfaces of the
above-ground parts of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the crown of your plants, quite often,
I'm sure some of you have noticed that
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the larvae hang out right there at
the crown of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's their favorite place, and they're
slowly munching through and killing parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the root system, which now are going
to, of course, be anaerobic and chock-full
[SPEAKER_01]: of diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sterility is not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're trying to prevent exactly why
we were spraying horrible toxic chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: all through the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to have all of these beneficial
organisms in there so that when that
[SPEAKER_01]: disease-causing organism is accidentally
brought into your greenhouse and somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves the handprint, we want to have
those beneficial organisms that look at
[SPEAKER_01]: those disease-causing organisms and go,
we had somebody brought lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they chow down and take them all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a direct conflict in many cases
with those kinds of organisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the beneficials regard the
disease-causers as just a source of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want those kinds of beneficial
organisms in your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sterile, not a good idea because you
can't keep human beings sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're probably the biggest problem
in spreading diseases throughout a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and in places that you'd never
think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like when people are standing at
the table and they're transplanting this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant from A to B and they take all the
dead leaf material off, they maybe see
[SPEAKER_01]: some dead roots and they pull that off,
what are they doing with that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material?
[SPEAKER_01]: They drop it on the floor next to them,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've set up a perfect
environment for all of the whiteflies and
[SPEAKER_01]: the micro arthropods, the little tiny
flying critters, perfect place for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: lay their eggs and for the larvae to hatch
out and go through that whole stage right
[SPEAKER_01]: there in the gravel under your feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people don't think about they've got
to clean that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the best way of cleaning that
floor material?
[SPEAKER_01]: Apply some compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apply some compost extract that's got the
organisms that are going to take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: all of those disease-causers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have to keep it aerobic enough
so don't overwater, but certainly when you
[SPEAKER_01]: look at what triggers the plant's immune
system, its resistance to diseases,
[SPEAKER_01]: and pests, it's those microorganisms that
will trigger, they'll send out to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant the information that there's
something bad happening here, the hordes
[SPEAKER_01]: of, I don't know, what should we call
them, purple devils are coming at us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need help from the plant and the
plant needs to contribute something to the
[SPEAKER_01]: upkeep of those bacteria, fungi,
protozoa, and nematodes that will attack
[SPEAKER_01]: and consume the diseases and the pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost hear the greenhouse managers
listening to this being aghast because
[SPEAKER_00]: their normal mindset is probably to spray
or clean their floors with either some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of chemical sterilizer or a 10 to 1
bleach, depending on the variety of floor
[SPEAKER_00]: they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now instead, we're talking about,
no, spray them with compost tea because we
[SPEAKER_00]: want the entire environment to be tied
together biologically so that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for any invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes total sense when you say it,
but it's also heresy from the way things
[SPEAKER_00]: have been done in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because we didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're no stranger to the heresy,
though, Elaine.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have I done all my life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm mostly interested in the truth
and I want to understand why things work
[SPEAKER_01]: and why when we've had systems that depend
on pulling the wool over people's faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because that's what the chemical
industry is, they've been convincing us to
[SPEAKER_01]: put out terribly toxic things to kill
particular sets of microorganisms who then
[SPEAKER_01]: just develop resistance to those chemical
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now how are you going to deal with
these problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way is biologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to get the beneficials back out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to keep it aerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a biggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make certain that we've got
critters that eat those organisms and we
[SPEAKER_01]: want those things that will inhibit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, definitely with toxic chemicals,
but it doesn't leave the area around the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterium or around the roots or the
hyphae of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't just mindlessly go out and
apply massive amounts of toxic chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: far beyond what you actually need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's give these organisms a chance to
show you what they can do, where you will
[SPEAKER_01]: become accustomed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully all of our children will read
stories about this time in life in the
[SPEAKER_01]: history of man and go, how could these
people have been so blind?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the power of the written word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how much of that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sure, we need to learn best
practices for using nature to support
[SPEAKER_00]: nature instead of chemicals to keep nature
at bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outside of the best practices,
so much of it is just trust too,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was brought up to trust
chemicals and pharmaceuticals for that
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we realized that that was a
philosophy that over time was bunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we need to kind of like untrain
ourselves back towards regenerative,
[SPEAKER_00]: which for the most part is what we try to
do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another question about the pest
populations, and that's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: corollary to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more folks in cannabis are
learning to effectively use beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and trust them more, just like we
were talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think about beneficial insects
through the lens of the soil food web,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of imagine that dumping thousands
of beneficial predators of any variety
[SPEAKER_00]: into a cultivation area might throw off
the balance of the local soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, target pest populations will be
reduced, whatever it is they eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are there any other potential soil
food impacts that we should be aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: when using beneficial insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we are super packing a particular
niche of the soil food web with suddenly a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the idea that they're just
going to eat the target pests and then
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually go off to find new food
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't actually know that to be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's essentially true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like when you put a huge amount
of a predator into the system,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to go looking for prey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will drop the species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what if those things that just got
eaten by the beneficial insects,
[SPEAKER_01]: what if they were what prevents some other
disease from attacking the root system of
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're, you honed right in on
exactly what the problem is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a density problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to spread those beneficial
insects out throughout your whole bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't be applying them, everything
goes into the soil down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we assume they're going to spread all
the way down the end of your bed or your
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be putting a few in every
places you're going down the line,
[SPEAKER_01]: just a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it takes a lot of microorganisms,
a lot of the smaller critters,
[SPEAKER_01]: to satisfy the hunger of the predator that
you just dropped into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were already competing with each
other in whatever container you were
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've let them loose and they
just go crazy and knock the beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: prey group down to almost nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're looking for potential
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to, and so here's something that
we haven't quite gotten around to,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to have our microscope,
look at it and go, here's the problem
[SPEAKER_01]: organism coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I need more of these bacteria,
I need more of these fungi if I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: put in more of these beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be eating my bacteria and
fungi, and so I better make certain that
[SPEAKER_01]: my bacteria and fungi get a little bit of
extra food so that they can multiply and
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either that or you're going to have some
real shifts and swings and lots of good
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient availability in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, because you put on
the good guys for keeping the disease
[SPEAKER_01]: causing bacteria in line, you're also
going to lose your good bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's not enough nitrogen,
phosphorus, sulfur, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium available to your plant around
that route.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we would only do it one route at a
time, it might work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're doing this to the whole system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really do like to put these organisms
into the compost itself and let that
[SPEAKER_01]: predator-prey balance itself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I put the compost out there,
it's already with adequate amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria or fungi or pros or nematodes or
whatever, as compared to the predatory
[SPEAKER_01]: organism that you put in there to shut
down the disease causing or the pest
[SPEAKER_01]: microarthropods out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea of having over dense beneficial
insects is the first time that I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapped my head around the idea of
actually listening to application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I really had never thought about
using so many that they would go and start
[SPEAKER_00]: to be opportunists on other necessary food
sources that are not the target pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I reach out to my cobert rep and I
don't have a big garden, but I figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what I need with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get my bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, OK, the application rate
says this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I apply it to my pretty small
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I look, and there's all this left
in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll cop to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I've got extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be more safe if I add the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done that every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm realizing that it's actually
working against me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what I should do is hand those
beneficial insects off to a friend for
[SPEAKER_00]: their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, somebody else who can really use
them and will see that benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've used them before,
you probably have a certain amount of the
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficials present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they leave eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They leave dormant stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll be up and moving, doing their
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably don't have to add as much in
the second year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give it to friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And say, tell me how it works out for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pretty soon you have another
client.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hit on the pathogen topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you were talking about when people
drop necrotic leaves on the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere, greenhouse or outside in the
garden or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly common for cannabis
cultivators to defoliate their plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: open up airflow towards the inside or to
remove yellowing leaves and place them on
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the kind of bro science idea is to
return the nutrients in the leaf back.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be good for the plant because I'm
just returning nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on Shaping Fire episode 88,
plant pathologist Cora McGee suggested
[SPEAKER_00]: that all those leaves should be removed
from the cultivation area totally to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent the spread of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on this very common
practice of cultivators to put even the
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy leaves that they take off onto the
top of the pot instead of removing them
[SPEAKER_00]: from the grow area to the compost or
something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you have no biology in your dirt,
then yeah, you have to do what she said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's those leaves, brown,
diseased, happy, good leaf material.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diseases are going to take those over
and serve to increase the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have no decent biology in that
soil, if you're trying to grow plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt, it's not going to work very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are using a biological approach
and you've got these really good organisms
[SPEAKER_01]: in your soil, then the way to tell if it's
working that you drop those infected
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves on the surface of your soil,
you should see by the next day that things
[SPEAKER_01]: are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: These leaves are getting eaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're being decomposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're being turned into soil as you
watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long is it going to take for a
small cannabis leaf to decompose?
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple days.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about a bigger one?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we've got a real big... Well,
it would help if you shredded that up a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit and put it on the surface of
the soil because then in a couple days
[SPEAKER_01]: those materials would be gone as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might still see the skeleton of the
major veins for a couple more days than
[SPEAKER_01]: you see the green plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it should all decompose.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't decompose, then Mother
Nature is trying to tell you that you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have all of the biology that you
need in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please go get your microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go take a look at what the biology is in
this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't they here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they should be if you used good
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good compost teas, you should have all of
those organisms in the soil and that
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposition should be overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it takes too long a time,
you probably want to try to figure out who
[SPEAKER_01]: killed your microorganisms in this part of
the pile or in this part of your growing
[SPEAKER_01]: system or greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite often we discover the places where
your neighbor sprayed something and that
[SPEAKER_01]: spray blew you into your operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right here we're not seeing any
decomposition because we got glyphosate in
[SPEAKER_01]: here and that killed your organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not going to take that much
trouble for you to go get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: your compost and sprinkle it over that
area and make sure that the decomposition
[SPEAKER_01]: comes along right away and then you're
good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have very simple solutions to some
of these quite common complex problems
[SPEAKER_01]: that other people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to tease out the
differences in perspectives of scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: because I can see very clearly now that
Cora offered that opinion because she
[SPEAKER_00]: works in a fusarium laboratory greenhouse
using sterile soil because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: studying fusarium and so for her she
doesn't have the strength in her growing
[SPEAKER_00]: system of a very active living soil
because that would get in the way of their
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring things and ensuring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always interesting to be able to
tease that out because so many people in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, they will argue, well,
this specialist thinks this and this
[SPEAKER_00]: specialist thinks that and one of them has
to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always like, you've only learned
that kind of like at a t-shirt quote
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you really need to understand what's
behind what they're thinking before you
[SPEAKER_00]: get all evangelist about it or especially
angry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and ready to chew somebody up one
side and down the other which is not a fun
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: When if they just took a step back,
viewed the system and realized what's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We aren't going against the principles of
chemical agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just paying attention to what Mother
Nature has already put in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mother Nature has been working in
these systems, well, been working on this
[SPEAKER_01]: planet ever since rooted plants arrived on
the planet which was a billion years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother Nature has had a billion years to
figure out these interactions to keep all
[SPEAKER_01]: of these wonderful plants alive and
functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: If she didn't work, then we would be in
serious trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't have these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to learn the messages from
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't figured them all out yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, please come work in the lab
with us for a while and discover all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these things and then you too can get your
name in lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're big fans of living
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you and I both personally,
but also like shaping fire the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk primarily about living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't talk a whole lot about how to
live in the fresh air unless it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a special water food web,
kind of hydro setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But using a blend of cocoa coir and peat
is wildly popular in cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: at the moment especially like bagged cocoa
coir and peat with, often with you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: preloaded with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but it isn't soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the biology of these pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like it would be significantly
lacking in soil food web biology that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes plant living in soil thrive,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they don't have the sand,
silt, and clay and organic material in
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how do you teach this idea of the
threshold between using soil, which has
[SPEAKER_00]: got, you know, sand, silt, clay,
organic material, versus using coir and
[SPEAKER_00]: peat with nutrients because they both grow
plants and people are very satisfied with
[SPEAKER_00]: their cocoa plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like they're leaving some taste
and pest resistance and resilience and
[SPEAKER_00]: health on the table because they're
choosing a half step and not going all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way to living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on these cocoa-peat
mixes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa and peat probably need to be
sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is one of those situations
where it probably, because you've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: material in a plastic bag sealed and if
there's any active organisms in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to start growing on all that
great organic material in there and your
[SPEAKER_01]: bag is going to puff up and explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to have used some kind of
toxic material in order to kill off the
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms in that peat and coconut coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it just be like heat or pressure or
does it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on exactly what they're set up
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one way or another, they're denaturing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're exiting that from the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making certain that nothing's
growing in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when you add your organisms,
say, in a good compost, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: see some initial lag before the organisms
really get going and often if the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration of that toxic material was
really high, you won't see any microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and therefore you're not getting
what you put the peat and coconut coir in
[SPEAKER_01]: there to do, which is provide a food
resource for the microorganisms that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to help your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get into an understanding of
what's the difference between soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt, dirt is just the mineral materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sand, the silt, the clays are
produced by weathering and that used to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest thing that could start
breaking down the boulders and the parent
[SPEAKER_01]: material and the rocks and etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: into sand, silt, and clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as microorganisms came along,
it's the microorganisms that do that
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposition of the rocks, pebbles,
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's producing sand,
silt, and clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very specialized niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need many of them because
they're not really going to be helping
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants along.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Mother Nature needs to have them out
there so we can go ahead and get those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've defined dirt, just the mineral
component.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're talking about soil,
you have to add, and this is according to
[SPEAKER_01]: the work of Hans Jenny, one of the fathers
of soil science.
[SPEAKER_01]: He defined soil very clearly as being the
mineral component, the sand, the silt,
[SPEAKER_01]: the clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also have to have organic matter
in order to feed your microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to have the beneficial
microorganisms, the bacteria, fungi,
[SPEAKER_01]: protozoa, and nematodes at the very least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then more microarthropods,
macroarthropods, spiders, and all those
[SPEAKER_01]: things also play into a really good,
well-rounded soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the difference between those two
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mix that you talked about is just
food, organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially since they had to destroy
the biology on that organic material in
[SPEAKER_01]: order for it to sit happily on the shelf
in the greenhouse, in the store,
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever they're storing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to make certain that we get
that planting material out and mix it with
[SPEAKER_01]: our compost, making sure that the compost
isn't killed by the toxic chemicals that
[SPEAKER_01]: were used to kill everything in that
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take it one more step and
put a little sharper edge on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I'm doing this is because
so many people, so many newer growers ask
[SPEAKER_00]: me about cocoa peat mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to repeat inaccurate or
incomplete information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to take it one more step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that the person is using a cocoa
peat mix that has been denatured or
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilized with heat or pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're not talking about residual
toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the folks bring it home,
and they fill their containers with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa peat blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because they want to capture some
active biological activity, they'll pour
[SPEAKER_00]: compost teas in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people have the ideas,
like, OK, now my preferred substrate that
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use now has microbe life in it
because I just poured my tea in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always resisted this idea after
Jeff Lowenfels kind of said it real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, it's not living soil if worms
aren't living in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that generally doesn't apply to,
that's not going to happen in this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like cocoa peat mix I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are your thoughts on starting with
a non-toxic but sterile cocoa peat blend
[SPEAKER_00]: and then adding compost teas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that get you there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly should, especially if that
compost that you use to make the extract
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the tea, if it has the spores as
well as any of the dormant stages washed
[SPEAKER_01]: off that leaf material, that compost
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And into the water that you're now going
to inoculate on the peat moss and core.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a question of how much you
don't want to overdo because that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really strong food resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might have such a rapid growth of
microorganisms in your beds now that it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes down aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you started from zero, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cuz you now let this goodly amount,
maybe too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you determine what's too little
and what's too much?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we often encourage our students to do
a little bit of testing in small
[SPEAKER_01]: containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take a handful of your compost,
take a handful of the pea and core mixture
[SPEAKER_01]: and mix it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll put some of your compost tea in
there at the concentration that's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: as outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And watch and see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you come by the next morning and
you go, what is wrong with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a smell in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like someone vomited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you realize that that's your little
container of core and etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put in too much biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's too much food for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So crank down the amount of compost that
you're putting in with all those great
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reduce it by half and see if you don't get
a better effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really want to be experimenting
with something where you just put your
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable plants into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next morning it's, surprise,
how dead is that plant going to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the care that I would want to
have people take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, get that microscope out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a look at the biology that's present
as soon as you mixed everything together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 24 hours later, take another look
and see that everything has just gone
[SPEAKER_01]: gangbusters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's Florida ceiling
bacteria squished into small places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's too rich for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like if I were to kind of tie
this all together into a quickie best
[SPEAKER_00]: practice, it would be if you prefer to use
cocoa and peat and make sure that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: denaturing from something nontoxic like
pressure or heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get it to your house and
you want to add biology to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: go ahead and use your compost teas but
start slow and low so that you don't push
[SPEAKER_00]: it too far too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would think that I would want to
encourage people to also use a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: teas and worm casting extracts and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're continuing to add variety to the
pot in slow amounts as you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it won't ever become living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've chosen cocoa, this is going
to be your best way to also have an active
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it's still a compost because
the core and the peat moss, those are just
[SPEAKER_01]: foods for your microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have to replenish that
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe as you're taking a little bit of
compost, you have a little bit left over,
[SPEAKER_01]: spread it out on this field so you get a
little bit of the sand silk clay mixed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really considered coir of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it degrades, I can see how it would
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always kind of thought of it as akin
to styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a carbon source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your fungi need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria don't like it much because
bacteria have a carbon and nitrogen ratio
[SPEAKER_01]: typically down around 10 carbons for every
one nitrogen, which means all bacteria are
[SPEAKER_01]: desperately in search of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get all the carbon they could
possibly ever use and they blow it off as
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are not the organisms we want in
our soils if we're trying to sequester
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get the fungi growing because
fungi have a C to N ratio of up around 100
[SPEAKER_01]: to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the fungi will take all that extra
carbon and put it inside its empty fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: tubes, the empty hyphae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that prevents micro arthropods from
being able to eat the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really good way to put things
away in a very safe place for a very long
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're ever thinking of carbon
sequestration, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really grateful that you went down
that path with me because I'm much happier
[SPEAKER_00]: because historically, my cocoa friends,
I kind of made it a habit to ask them hard
[SPEAKER_00]: questions about the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of being a jerk like that,
I can go to them like, oh, do you know Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elaine's best practices for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, let me support you in your chosen
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a much better way to
interact with my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they taking the peat moss?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many other good sources of food
for the microorganisms right around you in
[SPEAKER_01]: your natural biome, in the habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why buy something like peat moss that's
destroying an ecosystem someplace and
[SPEAKER_01]: using that as food for your
microorganisms?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of other places where you
could get waste organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you keep in some eye on how
much banana peel and how much oats and
[SPEAKER_01]: what are your kids eating and you're
putting in the garbage, dry it out every
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are dryers that you can buy that are
very inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you finish drying it down,
you just crunch everything up and put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a bag in the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can make your own peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while peat certainly has a use as a
source, most of the time I'm hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: people say, that they like the peat in the
mix because it retains water and it helps
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like balance the water that's in a
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something else that you prefer to
peat to help kind of stretch out a
[SPEAKER_00]: watering and kind of help regulate how wet
the pot is or rather that will sustain the
[SPEAKER_00]: watering a little longer in a balanced
way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you want to get the particles in
whatever your, like my example of the
[SPEAKER_01]: food, waste food in your kitchen and you
dry it down and you grind it up and now
[SPEAKER_01]: you take it out of wherever you're storing
it because if it's completely dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And take that out now and how much water
will that dried material be able to hold?
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually it's quite close to peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of think of those kinds of
materials because there's a diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got some potato, you've got some
banana, you've got, you know, what else
[SPEAKER_01]: did your kid not eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Broccoli, cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you dry them down and now how much
water will it take to wet that back up?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you'd see it was very close to
the peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only ever thought about those scraps
as a food source and not as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go ahead and take our
second short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Dr. Elanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volcani
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side by sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_00]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping fire listeners can get 10% off any

[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots, or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_00]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco, endomycorrhizal, inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options in who to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_00]: ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend Gaslamp Seeds to my friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners who are looking for a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably already know Gaslamp Seeds as
Hembra Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hembra recently changed their name to
Gaslamp Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp Seeds is not just another seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp is a female-operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: With over 60 breeders and over a thousand
strains to choose from, you will certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: find something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp Seeds has something for everyone,
with over 650 feminized strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 regular varieties, and over 200
autoflowers to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Names you know you can trust, like
Compound Genetics, Humboldt Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Owl, In-House, Fast Buds,
Gnome Automatics, and Ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money,
[SPEAKER_00]: but have no customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited Gaslamp to advertise on Shave
Keeping Fire after hearing so many good
[SPEAKER_00]: stories about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have A-plus customer service with
lightning fast response times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will get
your order out the same day you place it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most seed banks are simply not this
organized or interested in getting your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to you so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Gaslamp Seeds cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even get free seeds with every order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helene and Caitlin get it.

[SPEAKER_00]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a peat moss replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_00]: container growing, but organic growers are
recognizing now that peat moss is an
[SPEAKER_00]: unsustainable resource, and the mining of
peat bogs destroys wetland habitats and
[SPEAKER_00]: releases sequestered carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that provides
[SPEAKER_00]: better benefits while being a sustainable
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems, is actually made from upcycled
organic paper and cardboard headed for
[SPEAKER_00]: landfills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: in tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption, and water
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades-long
[SPEAKER_00]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is lightweight and easy to use,
and pit moss is inert, so it won't change
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available in a range of preparations,
including a nutrient-enhanced blend and an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic soil conditioner with no added
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding for horses, chickens, and small
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Dr. Elaine, you know, in regenerative
farming, we do our best to mimic nature
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, to support it, and, you know,
use nature to repair itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make a case for cultivators to
emphasize compost extracts over aerated
[SPEAKER_00]: compost teas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, burgeoning incubated
pots in populations of oxygen-loving
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are pretty unlikely to occur
naturally in the soil, while compost
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts really more effectively biomimic
what happens in nature by seeping into
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material and then seeping through it
as we find in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how should we wrap our heads around
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of these cases of it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to take a step back and look at
what you want as the outcome of applying
[SPEAKER_01]: these different materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, with a compost,
you're going to put it down someplace that
[SPEAKER_01]: needs the organic matter, as well as the
organisms replenished in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, typically, right down the furrow
or, you know, right around the trees in an
[SPEAKER_01]: orchard or something, you know,
shrubs or, you know, blueberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're looking at compost tea,
that's really the organisms as they
[SPEAKER_01]: typically exist in our close, you know,
the closest we ever come to making soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, those organisms we want to extract at
the concentration that you need to put
[SPEAKER_01]: into your system to get the biology back
up to where it belongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're going through succession and
we're trying to understand that early in
[SPEAKER_01]: succession, it's strictly bacterial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Midway through succession, it's 50-50
fungi bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's, you know, in an old-growth
forest, it's, you know, 100 to 1,000 times
[SPEAKER_01]: more fungi than bacteria in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so understanding that we are going to
extract the compost and apply it as that
[SPEAKER_01]: amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's going to be asleep normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is supposed to be asleep at that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that's supposed to be happening
now, that's already happening in the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you do the extraction,
these organisms go out hopefully more or
[SPEAKER_01]: less in the balances that we want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll take a look using our microscopes
to determine if what I'm putting on is
[SPEAKER_01]: strictly bacterial and that's going to
help those early successional systems that
[SPEAKER_01]: we probably don't want because early
successional systems are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly weeds and, you know, things that
aren't crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not really anything that farmers
want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we improve that fungal component,
then we're going to be putting on an equal
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass of fungi and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're selecting for the more
productive plants in the system,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, grasses and vegetables,
those kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we go over the edge into a
fungal-dominated system, and now we're
[SPEAKER_01]: promoting the growth of shrubs and trees,
the higher in that successional process,
[SPEAKER_01]: up into the old-growth system,
we're going to be just pushing fungi like
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much bacteria biology do you need
to be putting out and of what type?
[SPEAKER_01]: So answering those kinds of questions,
if we've made a compost tea, extracted the
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms from the compost into a liquid
form because it's way easier to apply a
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid than it is to apply that solid
material, we're drenching right around the
[SPEAKER_01]: base of all of the plants that we are
concerned about that we want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and making sure that that
fungal-to-bacterial ratio is what it needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically that's what we're going to be
applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will let that do its thing for about a
week, and we'll go back and take another
[SPEAKER_01]: sample and look at what's happened in that
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has the biology improved?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're trying for something that's
equal biomass, fungi, and bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: are both bacteria and fungi getting higher
and higher in value?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we want to see, so we're
constantly checking.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you see the place that you were
hoping for both bacteria and fungi to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, and the fungi are just taken off
like crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not good for the plant we're
trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our plant needs equal biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go back and we'll develop like a
compost tee where we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in bacterial foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting the bacteria up to where
it's going to equal what's going on with
[SPEAKER_01]: the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then that gets applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what if it was the other way around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then we would put in foods that
would improve the fungi instead of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have these tests along the way to
make sure everything's going the right
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a microscope and you put
things on, you're just crossing your
[SPEAKER_01]: fingers and hoping that Mother Nature is
going to be kind to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, Mother Nature, I think,
has a not-so-wonderful attitude about
[SPEAKER_01]: human beings, because we have not been
doing nice things to her work on this
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've got to fix this and get it
back to where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here you have all of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the tools that you need to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, with a compost tee, in general,
the reason why we would be making a
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tee is because we've got to up the
amount of bacteria or fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also, when we're looking at the
above-ground part of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: the form of putting the biology back out
there is going to be as a compost tee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we want to look and see what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everything's going just fine,
we probably would put out something that
[SPEAKER_01]: was equal biomass, fungi, and bacteria for
any tree that's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you do want to pay attention to your
soil, because when you apply the tee to
[SPEAKER_01]: the foliage, you're also going to be
getting some of the compost tee on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to be looking at your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be looking at what's going
on in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be looking at what's
happening in the foliage so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: determine what kind of tee are you going
to be making?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kinds of foods are you going to be
adding into that system?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mostly only use compost teas if I've
got disease-causing problems in the
[SPEAKER_01]: foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's strictly a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not drenching it on the soil at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we typically get rid of those
diseases very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get out at the beginning of the
growing season, you know that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular disease that this orchard or
these plants are very likely to have
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growers are saying every year we've
been applying these toxic chemicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the toxic chemicals just aren't
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing the job anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you come along, and we'll put the
compost tee out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does a very good job on dealing
with every disease organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several recent papers in the
scientific literature showing that if they
[SPEAKER_01]: put a good compost tee out, that they can
deal with Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we are dealing with Dutch elm
disease, no problem there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got that one figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some cases, we may have to go into
the plantation or into the agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: field and figure out how to get rid of a
disease by applying in the foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the time, we get it figured
out after just a couple weeks what we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to do to give constant protection to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember that it's not just the
organisms you're putting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the fact that you're getting nutrient
cycling going again in the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making certain that that plant has
all the nutrients it needs to express the
[SPEAKER_01]: disease protection, to express that
resistance to diseases and pest and
[SPEAKER_01]: problem organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a whole system working together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hopefully you can see why it's a
depends kind of answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is a depends kind of answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to focus on one thing you said,
because perhaps I misunderstood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I heard you say that you really
only use compost tee if there is an
[SPEAKER_00]: imbalance in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you do use it, you use it as a
foliar and not as a root drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I heard you correctly, my question
is this, if it's important for us that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has the nutrition it needs to remain
robust and have an active rhizosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: so everybody's communicating and trading
and the plant's getting what it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not adding more nutrition and
active biology via a compost tee,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the nutrition that you're referring to
simply amendments that you have added in
[SPEAKER_00]: advance before the life cycle of the
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was trying to go through the
succession of treatments that we usually
[SPEAKER_01]: do in trying to deal with these large
number of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only in that one case that you
wouldn't use a root drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would use it in other cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You first go out and take a look at what's
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go, oh my gosh, the only thing I
find here are bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are really not very good
bacteria, because that's all that can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: with the toxic chemicals and the inorganic
salts and all this tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only thing that's surviving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our first applications are going to
be compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have enough organic matter in
your soil to grow your microorganisms and
[SPEAKER_01]: that cut off is 3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the biggest things we'll have to
do when we've got those kinds of problems
[SPEAKER_01]: is get out there with more organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what is in your compost?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's organic matter and organisms,
so get it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll come back two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we may go in furrow at that point
where we're putting the compost tee down
[SPEAKER_01]: in furrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we want to make certain that we've
got the balance right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put the compost down if we need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a week or two weeks later,
we'll come back and take another look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the biology and make sure it's getting
going in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that determines for us what's
still missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what kind of compost are we going
to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be extracting these
organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: To put into the soil as a drench going
along the row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we may have to repeat that once or
twice before we can get the balance of the
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms back up to what it needs to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to really turn our
attention to what are the diseases that
[SPEAKER_01]: the client has shown are problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we're going to determine the
compost tee that we're likely to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply because there's too many diseases
for me to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: But based on this disease, we're going to
make a compost tee that will very strongly
[SPEAKER_01]: suppress those diseases that are strictly
foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a root disease, we would probably
go back to drenching the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe if it's a really specific part of
the tree that is showing disease symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And conifers are much more likely to
behave in that fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll inject the compost extract into the
soil around that infected root and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: hope that that takes care of the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that root, if it doesn't, it's going to
kill that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when should we take it down now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or try to baby this one very sick tree?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we take it down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your client is the person who's going to
make that call.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for breaking that out a bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting how any conversation
about if for somebody who's taking their
[SPEAKER_00]: soil seriously, and thinking about
varieties of compost tee, it always comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back to microscope skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a decade, we were trying to encourage
cannabis growers to get soil tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they were afraid to send their
soil in, because people were generally
[SPEAKER_00]: hiding and they didn't want to send in
soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, it got safe enough to send in
soil tests and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people are pretty well established
on the importance of a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right on those heels is basic
microscope skills, so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what's going on in your soil
and your compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's easier to do the microscope
work yourself, rather than sending it off
[SPEAKER_01]: to a laboratory where you're not quite
sure what kind of methodology they're
[SPEAKER_01]: using to extract the soluble in,
the total in, the exchangeable,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of those different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as people hand me...
[SPEAKER_01]: So chemistry reports, and it's got a
column of numbers behind titles like
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate, sulfate, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, this is meaningless.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to know what extraction
agencies they've been using to really...
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the context is for the numbers,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, it's really easy to find that
information that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you have to do to get this
plant back into a really healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: condition?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times I find that chemical
analysis isn't much help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we're working on trying to
really figure that out for people,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that there'll be a publication coming
along that really helps them integrate
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on with the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what the biology is doing,
as well as having some of the soluble and
[SPEAKER_01]: total nutrient values in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help people really figure out what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll look forward to that report.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next question, I think, is a lot
simpler than the last couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really common towards the
end of a bloom cycle in cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to stop water before harvest day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my mentor did that, and he said,
well, it's like a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're letting it know it's at the end of
its season, and we want to decrease the
[SPEAKER_00]: total moisture volume in the plant so it's
a little easier to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my thoughts, it's always been,
I would want to be watering my soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biology all the way through harvest,
because without water, I'm going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: losing my stable, balanced microbe life as
they start going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that really, really tells the
plant that it's the end of the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that perhaps it's time for molds to
take over to recycle the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I want to keep my microbiology
strong and moistured right up to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I certainly am willing to be
inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are your thoughts about this
common practice to stopping watering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in containers like a week before
harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's really going to do the
microorganisms in your soil any harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting them ready for the harvest
period being gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these organisms have been, of course,
building aggregate structure in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: around the roots to hold on to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if anything, what's happened in is
you're getting the plant to go deeper,
[SPEAKER_01]: put those roots down deeper into the soil
to grab the water that it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant has mechanisms for upping the
amount of water that it'll take out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil around its root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm not sure how much good it
really, for a week, is probably not enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to affect the growth of that plant in any
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really dry, arid areas, maybe so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be interesting to look at
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What goes on with the biology around the
root system as you're letting this drying
[SPEAKER_01]: process happen, you're not going to lose
any species.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to go dormant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially with water, they've got a
fair amount of time to respond to the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that the water really is drying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is time to go get into
dormant form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you come through and you harvest,
you have less damage from harvest because
[SPEAKER_01]: the organisms are already going sound
asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it doesn't really ring my bells at
all to get worried about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about something specifically
for the indoor cultivators for a moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: Elaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, many indoor cultivators try to
make mimic outdoor regenerative techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: in their gardens because perhaps they
don't have access to outdoor space,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe they live somewhere where the
weather is just not going to play ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they want to grow indoors,
but they don't want to go the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: two-part salts game because they want to
be using healthier cannabis themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so perhaps they're still in pots,
but it's becoming very common to use four
[SPEAKER_00]: by four or four by eight indoor beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being indoors, there's a clear limit
to how much soil, food, web biomimicry can
[SPEAKER_00]: take place because there's so much of
nature that you're not participating in
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you just can't mimic indoors in a
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For indoor folks, how should we think
about that natural limit to how much
[SPEAKER_00]: biomimicry we can do and best adapt our
indoor gardens in an attempt to make them
[SPEAKER_00]: as true as possible to the soil,
food, web?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the biggest problem I think is going
to be that the roots should be growing
[SPEAKER_01]: down and not out to the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suppose if you had a situation where
that's the only, you don't have someplace
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can hang the baskets with plants
growing in it up at six or eight feet high
[SPEAKER_01]: so the root systems can go down into a
trench that you would dig in the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a novel thing to picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the boards out between your ground
floor and the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could have the above ground part up
in a bubble window and then the pots and
[SPEAKER_01]: with the roots growing down into your
basement, you might be able to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: typical of what we want to have occurring
out in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what if your field isn't actually
doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your field is compacted at some depth and
the roots will only grow down to that
[SPEAKER_01]: depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will tend to go sideways then and be
fighting with the next plant over because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all not getting the nutrients or
the water that they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is, what is it that you're trying to
mimic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your not so healthy plants that are
outside hitting a compaction layer or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be building structure in
that compaction layer so over the years
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be able to get the root
systems of your plants down the 12,
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 feet that we're hoping for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you would have to biomimic it
inside your house if you brought those
[SPEAKER_01]: pots in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like since we, even though I
really love the idea of sketching out this
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging pots and having it go through a
tube to a trough, it sounds like really
[SPEAKER_00]: folks who want to biomimic soil food web,
their best things to focus will be on just
[SPEAKER_00]: ensuring that they have got the most
complex soil and rhizosphere as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: by supporting the residents that are
already there and then continuing to
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculate with IMOs and such things and
just focus on the biology of the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: call that good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using the extracts, the compost,
the teas as needed to try to keep the food
[SPEAKER_01]: web balanced because one of the things
you'll discover is what is the balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and fungi for this particular
cultivar of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one did you buy and how much
difference is there going to be between
[SPEAKER_01]: this first species versus the second
subspecies, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be fun to find out about
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just got two questions left for
you and before we go to the final one,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of a delightful
philosophical position for us to end the
[SPEAKER_00]: show with, I'd really love you to just
give us your elevator pitch about the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: food web school that you started because
so many of us have been accessing your
[SPEAKER_00]: education and message and insights through
books and papers and YouTube presentations
[SPEAKER_00]: for these years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you've kind of taken all of that
and gone pro and made it a system so that
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody can work through the entire range
of soil food web ideas and then get a
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate in the end as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you just tell us a little bit
about that before we wrap up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What we saw was that people learning the
techniques and then going back home and
[SPEAKER_01]: applying them, it's hard for them to do
the research kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't go through that of how to figure
things out if it's not exactly the way we
[SPEAKER_01]: were talking about it in the classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we realized that we needed to start
getting our students understanding that
[SPEAKER_01]: every time we say it depends, that means
they're going to have to do a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of researching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like the little containers where we
can put in, let's see, six cups of our
[SPEAKER_01]: woody mix, three cups of our green plant
material, and then one cup of our high
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mix that all up and make certain
that you're watering it so it's got a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of moisture in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Treat it just like you would your larger
compost piles inside the bird cages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And watch the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that really high nitrogen that you put
in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a problem where you're not seeing
any bacterial growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can design your compost system
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're doing some testing where you're
trying different materials as high
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the best high nitrogen that I've
got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the best woody substrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it matter if I let that woody
substrate get completely involved in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of different fungi and I use that as
compared to something that was just ground
[SPEAKER_01]: up two or three months ago or something
like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you test for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're teaching our students that
there's a way to deal with questions that
[SPEAKER_01]: you might have and figure it out for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we'd like to have you all send back in
what you discover so we can just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: enlarging the table about where in the
world are you and what is the best source
[SPEAKER_01]: of high nitrogen, the best source of
sources of woody materials and so on and
[SPEAKER_01]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of examples that I could give,
but I'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like the main gist or intent,
I guess is probably a better word for the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil food web school is so we've studied
these ideas of the soil food web rote to
[SPEAKER_00]: memorize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the school does is it gives you
the skills to do the research so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do the processes that you need in
order to be able to work with soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just like you read it in a textbook,
but that you actually have ownership over
[SPEAKER_00]: the techniques and the ideas.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we know that every bit of a biome
is not going to be behaving the same way,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you understand succession,
which I just barely started going through,
[SPEAKER_01]: which when you look at a watershed and you
look at the fact that up there at the top
[SPEAKER_01]: of the mountain is mostly conifer forest
and then you've got deciduous forest and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you've got the shrubs and bushes and
this is succession.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at succession.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where is your land or where is your
client's land?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it down here in the riparian zone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a weedy area that gets disturbed all
the time by wild and crazy things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Going up the slope a little bit into
shrubbery and really high, good,
[SPEAKER_01]: highly productive grasslands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have that microscope to be
answering most of these questions about
[SPEAKER_01]: what's missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can pretty easily start to build a
good library about here's what you do
[SPEAKER_01]: when.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can have that for the school,
so you see what we're doing is what are
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that will make it easier and
easier for students to be successful out
[SPEAKER_01]: in the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sounds like it's a setup for what
to do when the answer is it depends.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's follow this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Elaine Ingham, you've been an
educator and an activist actually for soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's certainly true that regenerative
growing techniques have increased in
[SPEAKER_00]: popularity and the generations behind us
are even more interested than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the fertilizer lobbyists also
still have a strong hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what advice or insight would you share
with those who will carry the torch
[SPEAKER_00]: forward in this fight that sometimes
almost seems overwhelming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it seemed overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed overwhelming to convince the
world that soil is alive 45 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet we've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we got over kind of the threshold of
people accepting that, it didn't matter
[SPEAKER_01]: what the chemical companies were talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't matter that our politicians are
in the pocket of those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the general public decides,
it goes that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we've got to make this
as understandable for the average person
[SPEAKER_01]: that they get it and they demand that
their food is grown this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're going to get all of
our nutrients from plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: recycling nutrients and building nutrients
and building protection and that transfers
[SPEAKER_01]: to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microorganisms on the outside of all
of the food that we eat should be what
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother Nature put there and not what we
put there by spraying pesticides or
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying, you know, for whatever it is
we're going to go out there and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't ever kill if you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there's a few exceptions like
human pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do always have to kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to be using a system that
is not toxic chemicals that spread
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere, that leach from all of our
ecosystems, from all of our agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: systems into the water and destroys water
quality of everything downstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we've got to get the reasons for
dealing with landfills that are just
[SPEAKER_01]: oozing horrible combinations of toxic
chemicals into the rivers and lakes and
[SPEAKER_01]: streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are humans supposed to survive if
those are the kinds of systems that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: living in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Elaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this brings us to our end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Elaine Ingham, thank you so much for
sharing your time and your expertise to
[SPEAKER_00]: join me today here on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even more so, thank you for your long
career of research and sharing it and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, giving a damn and sharing that
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was absolutely, you know, I've enjoyed
hearing you talk before, but it's been an
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute joy to have the opportunity to
actually interact with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some great questions and you led me
through them in a really thoughtful and
[SPEAKER_01]: useful way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I hope we can do this again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, dear listener, if you would like to
hear more from Dr. Elaine Ingham,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in luck because she is a guest that
there's a whole bunch online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I recommend you start these three
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first and foremost is SoilFoodWeb.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Dr. Elaine's website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the home of the school.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of resources and it's a
great place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second place, especially if you are
interested in, you know, learning some
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques as you go, is the Instagram for
the school as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's SoilFoodWebSchool on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there are like kind of,
you know, institutional posts about what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on at the school.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a whole bunch of
technique in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a profile that I enjoy
following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, probably the best place
to go is YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like listening to your education
like this, there's a whole bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that Elaine has done online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, Dr. Elaine is,
you know, a very published scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, if you also like to read your
education, you can find, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: many scientific papers and her books,
you know, with a simple search online.
