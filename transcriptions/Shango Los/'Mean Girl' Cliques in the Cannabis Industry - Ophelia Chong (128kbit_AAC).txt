[SPEAKER_00]: So Ophelia, I've heard about this one talk
that you give sometimes that's called mean
[SPEAKER_00]: girls about clicks, female clicks in the
cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen this talk and I haven't
seen a video of it, but I'd love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your idea of mean girls in the
cannabis scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you flash back to high school or
even grade school, there's always a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the girls that were the
cheerleaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was everyone else,
the outliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was always in a group of the
outliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I discovered as I was going
through high school, I kept saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I want to be one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once I graduated high school,
I thought, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I hate high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I go to college.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I realized was that women who
thought the best times of their life was
[SPEAKER_01]: in high school, it was going to go
downhill from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my first lessons as an adult was
don't, don't bloom in high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's fast forward to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we have here is everyone's coming
into the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's rushing in, but there's a great
opportunity for women.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are on a level playing ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go in and we can create something
whereas there was nothing there to begin
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of opportunity and a lot
of ways of playing outside the rules
[SPEAKER_01]: because women are really great about how
to think outside of the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to think about how to feed the
kids, make a house, work a job,
[SPEAKER_01]: do this, pick up that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really great about multitasking
and coming up with ways of making things
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cannabis industry is a great thing
to go into because if you were an
[SPEAKER_01]: accountant, you just add cannabis,
you can be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a chef, you become an infused
chef or make edibles business.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ran a great business, you can run
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but with that many women in there,
we're all looking at each other and going,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, how can they help me?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I help her?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we build these great communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some, some friends that I know are
lifelong in cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will know them until I get to the grave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing, wonderful men and women.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes you get that high school
mentality brought back in where it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is, this is my patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, nope, you're not, no, you're not
touching this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to share, but I want
everything that you have because I'm so
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you run into a lot of women with a very
large entitlement and ego.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't give them what you want,
they want, they become them, the mean
[SPEAKER_01]: girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, oh, that'll fill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a bitch because she just did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're building up already these
gangs and cliques.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're either pro affiliate or you're an
anti affiliate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that becomes this playground mentality
of groups in the corners, which should not
[SPEAKER_01]: happen because now not only are we
fighting, uh, to get a place of foothold
[SPEAKER_01]: with men, we're also fighting amongst
ourselves over petty things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how, and it is a culture that has been
brought in because women need to,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is how we bring each other down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about their looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about how they're not a nice
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we drag them down so that we can go
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Chinese expression called a
crabs in a box where crabs will never,
[SPEAKER_01]: well are not a community based group of
shellfish because every time one tries to
[SPEAKER_01]: get out of the bucket, another one grabbed
that crab and pull it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in cannabis, there are groups like this
where there are women that try to get
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead, but other ones will just pull them
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, she doesn't deserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I deserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She shouldn't get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rather than all of us saying we all
deserve it and we need to work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my case, I think I pissed off a
couple of women because, uh, I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: agree with their ethos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the way that they were, uh,
how they were in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken, that's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's my personal view.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, and so what they did was they
took it personally and maybe I made it
[SPEAKER_01]: personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a, there was that, but ever
since then, I am now called out as the
[SPEAKER_01]: mean girl for a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's, it's all, it's all high school
hijinks and eventually we'll get past
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we, we just need to grow a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what degree do you think that it is,
I mean, since, since you referred to it as
[SPEAKER_00]: mean girls, to what degree do you think
that it's a gender relationship or more
[SPEAKER_00]: that, um, you've got a whole bunch of a
type leader type, strong willed,
[SPEAKER_00]: independent women who are all in the same
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, they, they fall into power
blocks just because of the personality
[SPEAKER_00]: type, regardless of gender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the same for high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a whole group of a type girls too,
who strive to be at the top of the feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: frenzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so that whole culture again is
brought into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, I see a lot of it now in cannabis
because there are so many groups who want
[SPEAKER_01]: to take over from the place of women grow,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a few smaller groups popping
up and they're not working together rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than they're cannibalizing each other for
members.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a group, come to my group.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to go to that group because
I have the better speakers, this and this
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than just coming together as a
group or abandoning women groups and going
[SPEAKER_01]: into more mentoring groups for women who
are coming up rather than bring a speaker
[SPEAKER_01]: in, put people together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that I would rather see them going to
a panel, see three people who I've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: about four or five times already.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to give you much value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe to a new person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to a new person, I'd much rather have
that new person be paired with someone
[SPEAKER_01]: who's a little senior to help them
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's how we combat being girls
because a new person will not know where
[SPEAKER_01]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, I haven't seen very many,
uh, mentorship programs for either gender
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of incubators, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly that they're there, but that's
mentoring specifically based on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, VC capital and making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that a lot of people,
they don't want to, they don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: mentor folks because there already feels
like there's too many people in the field
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's so ultra competitive that a lot
of people consider their, uh, their
[SPEAKER_00]: business experience in cannabis to be
almost like intellectual property and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to mentor people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any more of that happening with
women for women?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I wouldn't see that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think actually then you make a really
great point because why there are not a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of mentors is time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone, some of the best that we know
cultivators or brewers, they don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to all have time to mentor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they do, it's more to be on a paid
consultant side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think women can mentor other women
because we, there's some up here who
[SPEAKER_01]: can't, this is not the time, but there are
a lot of us who are in middle and lower in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry that we can mentor someone
just coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I'm, you're not asking,
say a Kevin Jodry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To mentor you because you know,
he has no time, but you can ask maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: another cultivator who's lower,
who's just beginning to, who might have
[SPEAKER_01]: time and an exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good, this is what I learned
growing up Asian.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never go to a house empty handed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to someone and someone invites
you into a home, you bring something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone offers you help and wants to
mentor you, open it up and give them
[SPEAKER_01]: something because it is in appreciation
because the last thing you want is to have
[SPEAKER_01]: your mentor feel that they're being taken
to granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be then again, open your
heart because they open theirs to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a two way thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for sharing that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea if it's going to be
hearable with all those planes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three planes were super loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh huh.
