[SPEAKER_02]: Fungus of all kinds are really becoming
popular with a wider range of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Psilocybin is slowly starting to be
legalized for research and therapy,
[SPEAKER_02]: while psilocybin microdosing has exploded
in every corner of the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are hearing reports of fungus that eats
microplastics, how turkey tail helps cure
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer, and how lion's mane mushroom are
pretty much your brain's best friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, culinary mushrooms have been
enjoyed by humans forever, but we are
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing a huge resurgence in home and small
farm growing of culinary mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning that rare non-commercial varieties
are popping up at farmers markets and in
[SPEAKER_02]: the neighborhood trades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, I discovered that I totally
loved wine cap mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never come across that craft
mushroom until gifted it by a home
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm constantly searching for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, the fungus in the soil is
essential for all the food we eat and the
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers we love, especially cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many mushroom varieties touching our
lives and being helpful in so many ways.

[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest today is Stephanie Garcia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mycologist Stephanie Garcia has a degree
in botany and plant pathology and
[SPEAKER_02]: completed her master's program at the
University of Hawaii in tropical
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation biology, focusing on below
ground fungal diversity over varying
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental gradients on Hawaii Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: After completing her master's,
she proceeded to tour Southeast Asia,
[SPEAKER_02]: studying local plants and mushrooms and
landed back in Oregon, spending time
[SPEAKER_02]: between cannabis harvests and the Bureau
of Land Management.
[SPEAKER_02]: She now studies both endo and
ectomycorrhizal fungi and their
[SPEAKER_02]: associations and benefits to various plant
hosts as quality compliance manager at
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizal applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stephanie and her husband, Emery,
are expecting their first child in just a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are especially glad that she chose
to fit us in before that major milestone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you listen closely, you will hear
their dogs, Norm and Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Betty in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: On today's episode of Shaping Fire,
we will make sure we are all on the same
[SPEAKER_02]: page regarding the differences between
mycelium, mycorrhizae, endomycorrhizae and
[SPEAKER_02]: ectomycorrhizae, followed by a deeper
discussion about mycelium specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the second set, we will focus on
endomycorrhizae, its functions and how you
[SPEAKER_02]: can damage its functioning by inhibiting
the symbiosis taking place in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we finished the episode with a wide
ranging discussion of best practices for
[SPEAKER_02]: creating a thriving environment for
mycelium and mycorrhizae, including
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculants, proper watering, pH,
proper nutrition, and the use of ground
[SPEAKER_02]: covers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Stephanie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Shango.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start off with two bits of
vocabulary that are misused all the time
[SPEAKER_02]: in soil discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mycorrhizae and mycelium will be used,
you know, obviously the entire episode
[SPEAKER_02]: today, but it isn't uncommon for folks to
use the two words mycorrhizae and mycelium
[SPEAKER_02]: interchangeably, and they're not the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So will you start by teasing those apart
for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that you point out that some people
can get certain things confused like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about mycelium,
we're actually talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative structure of a fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could think of it as being
analogous to plant roots, so you could
[SPEAKER_00]: think of it as fungal roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the mycelium, that's what
mycelium is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a mushroom, if you go
mushroom hunting and you find a fruiting
[SPEAKER_00]: body, like say you go for morels right
now, because it's a perfect time of year
[SPEAKER_00]: to be looking for morels, there's gonna be
an entire network of their root system
[SPEAKER_00]: underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're talking about mycorrhizae,
that's actually describing a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mutualism, and it's occurring
between the plant roots and those fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mycorrhizae is more of an activity than
a physical thing that has a name that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: noun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more active than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It describes this relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't necessarily like, oh,
there's a mycorrhizae right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like, ah, those are two,
that is a host and a fungal network
[SPEAKER_02]: exhibiting mycorrhizae activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, that would be correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I mentioned the morel
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a mycorrhizal fungi, but you
wouldn't call their root system a
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could say a morel is a mycorrhizal
fungi, but when you want to describe how
[SPEAKER_00]: the morel's mycelium is interacting with
its plant host, that would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, mycorrhizae is really describing
the symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's used incorrectly all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, earlier in my soil
knowledge, I definitely was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we're at it, because even though
during the first set we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: discuss mycelium networks, and then we're
going to focus more on mycorrhizae in set
[SPEAKER_02]: two, I am pretty sure that you're going to
be talking about mycorrhizae as part of
[SPEAKER_02]: your answers during set one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should probably also get the other
key vocabulary that we want to tease apart
[SPEAKER_02]: too, which is the difference between
endomycorrhizae and ectomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So endomycorrhizae, when you think of
endo, you think of inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Latin meaning for endo is
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what it's describing is what's
happening more on the cellular level
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we go even more broadly,
endomycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with about 80 to 85% of plant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of our agricultural crops,
a lot of our ornamental crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: all grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call them more of our bread and
butter of mycorrhizal fungi because they
[SPEAKER_00]: associate with such a wide range of host
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go back down into the root on
the cellular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hyphae will penetrate into the root and it
goes between cells, but it also goes
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then inside the cell is really where
the nutrient exchange is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the endomycorrhizae, they make a
specialized structure called arbuscules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a site of nutrient exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most endomycorrhizal fungi also form
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a storage structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fungi are really good at helping
plants overcome drought type conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vesicles, they believe, for one reason why
they can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, the endomycorrhizal fungi,
you'll also see them or hear them being
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to as AMF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just stands for arbuscular
mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also hear or see them being
referred to as VAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's vesicular, arbuscular mycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't, refer them anymore,
refer to them anymore as the VAM because
[SPEAKER_00]: some species don't produce those vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're getting really detailed
there on the endomycorrhizal fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is important to understand that
these hyphae of these types of fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: they go inside the cell and then the
nutrient exchange is happening within the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytosolic fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now ectomycorrhizal fungi, on the other
hand, they don't associate with as broad
[SPEAKER_00]: of a host range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're associating with maybe five to
10% of plant species, primarily conifers,
[SPEAKER_00]: some hardwoods, and then there are some
agriculturally important plants that form
[SPEAKER_00]: the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then if we go down to that cellular
level again, and we compare it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: endomycorrhizal fungi, the ectomycorrhizal
fungi also make specialized structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do also penetrate into the root,
but they also make a mantle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mycelium will cover the outside of the
root, kind of like a sock, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Say your foot is like the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mycelium covers the root on the
outside, and then it also penetrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the root, but instead of carrying
out the nutrient exchange in an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: plant cell, the mycelium travels around
the cells and they call that a heartache
[SPEAKER_00]: net.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is another more specialized
structure that they make.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't produce any type of our
vesicles or vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they're just, they're doing all
their nutrient exchange in between cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're talking primarily about
cannabis cultivation and the ecto is
[SPEAKER_02]: really only interacting with, I think you
said like 10 or 15% of plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're probably going to be talking,
when we talk about mycorrhizae today,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to be generally assuming we're
talking about endomycorrhizae unless you
[SPEAKER_02]: point out otherwise, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis doesn't associate with
ectomycorrhizal fungi, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that makes it easier today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, so that's why I wanted to start
out there with the definitions of mycelium
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizae and then endomycorrhizae just
for everybody's benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that said, we will jump back and
talk much more in detail about mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_02]: during set two, but here let's smooth on
in right now to talking about mycelium
[SPEAKER_02]: networks to get a really good
understanding on what those are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mycelium are the fleshy, vegetative
white strands that form massive networks
[SPEAKER_02]: in the soil we now know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it consist of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what actually do the white strands?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they made of other than just
generally fungus?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are they made?
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, fungal cell walls are made of
chitin, so that's really what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: composed of and they're made through
meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, they're growing just in
the same way fresh growth would occur from
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really exploratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, most of them are more
whitish, tannish in color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycelium can consist of just one long
tubular-like structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also have septa, which divides
this long tubular structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for folks who aren't familiar with
meiosis, would you just explain that real
[SPEAKER_02]: quick?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's reproduction, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're basically having cell division
occur and then the DNA is being passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a pretty technical process
and it also depends on the species,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Even what you already said just kind of
makes it clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I was trying to getting at is like,
what is the mycelium making machine?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is itself is, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: By cellular splitting, just making itself
more of itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those of us who, you know,
are transplanting our plants or maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: we're out in the field collecting
indigenous microorganisms or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: we're doing, we'll come across mycelium
strands that are like a whole range of
[SPEAKER_02]: colors from like the bright white,
which I always think of as, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: those look really healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whereas some are, you know,
more of a whitish gray or some are like a
[SPEAKER_02]: whiterish beige.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are these different strains of mycelium
that are these different colors or does,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a healthy thriving mycelium,
is it always white and these colorations
[SPEAKER_02]: are signs of some kind of imbalance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a really great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is really species dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, morels, for example,
they don't have this bright white
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily mycelium, especially when you
have them in culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say, you know, that,
yeah, there may be some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental condition that might make
them this more dull yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe they're not the most
healthy, but also we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different colors of mycelium depending on
the species.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to know too, because I know,
you know, as I said, my question,
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that I needed it all to be
bright and I should not judge my mycelium
[SPEAKER_02]: necks were partially just because they
don't look bright and because that could
[SPEAKER_02]: cause me to incorrectly diagnose a
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there are different strains of
mycelium, how do mycelium networks of
[SPEAKER_02]: different species interact?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they, you know, explore and then butt
up to each other and then connect even
[SPEAKER_02]: though they're different species?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are these mycelium networks of
different strains kind of wrapped around
[SPEAKER_02]: each other, but not necessarily connected?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another really great question,
Jango.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that's really species
dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know in some mycorrhizal fungi,
there is competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I know of one researcher
that works on rhizopogon that is an
[SPEAKER_00]: ectomycorrhizal fungi, but they'll be more
competitive for their resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't necessarily, they may,
you know, they may just exist wrapped
[SPEAKER_00]: around each other, but really they're
competing for resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that case, I think that most of us
think about the mycelium networks as being
[SPEAKER_02]: these nutrition transport networks and
they're connecting everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in my mind, I go so far as
to think, oh, they're trying to help
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody get along.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually there is competition between
mycelial relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are bonding with networks that
they see as allies and then turning a cold
[SPEAKER_02]: shoulder and not connecting to networks
that they see as competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you could think of it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I do want to just clarify is
that there are other, there's another
[SPEAKER_00]: group of fungi that we're kind of
forgetting about a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're forgetting about our saprophytic
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not necessarily creating a
network between plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their mycelium is really there to decay
dead organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the recyclers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're recycling the duff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are a little different in
that they're creating their own little
[SPEAKER_00]: network just so that they can eat more,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can decay more and then eventually
maybe they can fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good that you picked that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely think that I was putting the
responsibilities for mycelium and
[SPEAKER_02]: saprophytic fungus into the same basket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's good for me to tease those
apart too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the mycelium networks, while I was
picturing them being large, like in
[SPEAKER_02]: covering a wide space, and therefore had
this idea that they were also going from
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know exactly how I was picturing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, perhaps mycelium networks are
a little bit more localized based on,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, the project or the
responsibility of that particular mycelium
[SPEAKER_02]: network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that you can think of it
almost like their little project,
[SPEAKER_00]: because even thinking outside of the
saprophytic fungi that are decaying this
[SPEAKER_00]: dead organic matter, we also have
parasitic fungi, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that the those could spread
from, you know, those could certainly make
[SPEAKER_00]: a network and go from tree to tree,
but they could also be more localized just
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on is their host available?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can they infect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do they infect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have other fungi that are
primarily existing on leaves that are
[SPEAKER_00]: causing damage there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So but yeah, I think when we think about
mycelium, and one reason why I love
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi so much is that we
really think of them more as the
[SPEAKER_00]: protagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to think of mycelium as being
this just incredible thing and this
[SPEAKER_00]: network that spreads, you know,
between the trees and, like you say,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to, you know, help everybody get along
and distribute out nutrients really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think when we think of mycelial
networks, we really do think about the
[SPEAKER_00]: more beneficial kind, and that would be
more, you know, like the mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I tend to drift into giving credit
to mycelium that's for saprophytic fungus,
[SPEAKER_02]: be sure to call me out on it again,
because I don't want to be spreading the
[SPEAKER_02]: bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here to get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but those are great, too,
because, you know, I mean, we would have
[SPEAKER_00]: just meters and meters of death in our
forests, and there's also some very tasty
[SPEAKER_00]: saprophytic fungi, so we don't want to
forget about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so let's talk about some of
these tasks that we rely on mycelium to
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you just, instead of me just
kind of like trying to pull a list out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the air, you're the expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me just kind of hand you the mic,
and tell us a little bit about the varied
[SPEAKER_02]: tasks that mycelium is doing in the soil,
you know, as part of its role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah, and I do just want to say,
you know, I still don't consider myself an
[SPEAKER_00]: expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just consider myself, you know,
constantly trying to educate myself in
[SPEAKER_00]: this pursuit of knowledge, specifically
with fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you saying that,
but, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be humble, but like we all heard
your credentials at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_02]: show, and you're here because like,
you know, you're kind of the expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate your humility on it,
but I have a feeling you have all the
[SPEAKER_02]: information that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll strive to meet those
expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you want to know about the roles
of mycelium within the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, I think mycelium's,
you know, its main objective, and it may
[SPEAKER_00]: be more of a selfish objective on its part
is to gain enough resources to reproduce,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'm going to explore the soil,
I'm going to try to gain resources enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to take care of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's one objective is that
mycelium is getting what it needs to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through its own life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another thing is just very
exploratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's like, let's say these side
benefits of mycelium and what it's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: within our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those mycelium to be exploring the
soil, they're really contributing to soil
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, to water infiltration,
which also helps preventing runoff and
[SPEAKER_00]: providing climate resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's, there's a big role for
them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can go back to my mycorrhizal fungi
for a moment, our muscular mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, they really produce a glycoprotein,
it's called glomalin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just this incredible protein
that helps to aggregate soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really fascinating,
not only for this, you know, helping to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep soil structure and the water,
water infiltration, but it also can hold
[SPEAKER_00]: on to carbon when your soil has more
structure to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those nutrients are more
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that there's a really big role
for mycelium to play in some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also, we also know that some mycelium
will actually excrete, secrete enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can help make a lot of different
nutrients more biologically available ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that wouldn't be otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's, it allows, you know,
this soluble nutrients to actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed and then transported to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, I think that these are some
of, some of the main ones just right away
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm, that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the transportation of
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm realizing now that some of what I
imagined mycelium networks doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: which would be like moving nutrition
between different plants, that's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: a larger role than mycelium is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might be more of a, a saprophytic
fungus role is, is the mycelium going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be mostly moving nutrition from the
surrounding soil environment and just
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing it back to the root zone as
essentially to the mycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is going to interact with the,
with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's kind of like, it is,
it is out searching for nutrition for its
[SPEAKER_02]: own life benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then by doing that, it is also
bringing that nutrition back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizae, which is, which we'll,
we'll discuss more in detail later is
[SPEAKER_02]: then, is then interacting with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is, is my range of where it's doing that
nutrition work, do I have that right where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a bit closer to the root zone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the saprophytic fungi and
the mycorrhizal fungi, they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the saprophytic fungi, that those fungi
may be able to break down, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically more carbon than the
mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we know, mycorrhizal fungi,
they, they're really associating with
[SPEAKER_00]: plants because they can't, they're not
able to access the carbon on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll save this for the next session
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so let's say the saprophytic fungi,
their primary role is going to be decaying
[SPEAKER_00]: this dead organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, making carbon available for
the plant, but then the fungi or the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi, they're, they're more
exploratory and they're actually able to
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver the nutrients to the plant through
their symbiosis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the saprophytic fungi, they may make
some of these nutrients biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: available, but they don't really have that
delivery mechanism unless they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: close to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mycorrhizal fungi and their
mycelial network is really incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can increase the root
absorption zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our plants can only reach so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycelium is so much smaller in size than a
plant root, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can travel for so much
longer than our plant roots can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can really become exploratory in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now trait areas that our plants cannot,
and then they're able to access nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then their mycelium is like a little
highway of nutrients going to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do also want to mention,
which I just think is interesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi, um, you know,
there's evidence to suggest that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved from saprophytic fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some mycorrhizal fungi still do hold
the genes that can do these other types of
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I just think that's really
interesting because some mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: we say are obligate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to have a plant host cause they
can't access their own carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we know some mycorrhizal fungi
are not obligate and they can,
[SPEAKER_00]: they still maintain some, some of these
genes so that they can exist without the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant host.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, um, you know, we're big supporters
of the soil, of the soil food web
[SPEAKER_02]: explanation for looking at soil here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What role does mycelium play in the soil
assisting microbe communities and other
[SPEAKER_02]: life in the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm, I'm guessing that it isn't
just a relationship between, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, breaking down nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrition and transporting nutrition
towards the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm, I'm guessing that, that all the
inhabitants of the rhizosphere have got
[SPEAKER_02]: varying relationships with mycelium that
are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did talk, you know, briefly about
soil structure and water infiltration,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this hyphae, um, you know,
going through the soil and just allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: that infiltration of water and then just
helping the soil actually hold the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did speak a little bit about
how when you have this really more
[SPEAKER_00]: positive, let's say soil structure,
it can hold on, um, to carbon more
[SPEAKER_00]: readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know that, um, our soil organic
carbon is food for microbes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have an increased amount of soil
carbon, you typically see an increase in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think mycelium plays, it's like
cyclical, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they grow and they explore and then
carbon's held onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these microbes are like,
Oh, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm going to, we're going to,
there's going to be more microbes cause we
[SPEAKER_00]: have more food and, and then they thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the soil just becomes,
um, just more, it's just more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody gets fed when mycelium is doing
its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I know that some people talk about
how mycelium can help remediate the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: that's been contaminated by a whole range
of things, but specifically, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious about, um, uh, uh,
pathogenic funguses like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that cause like, you know, um,
fusarium root rot and things like that
[SPEAKER_02]: can, can our ally mycelium clean up
pathogens like that in the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's such a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I told you, I really liked
the protagonist fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my, my plant pathology is up to speed,
but it just made me think of, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's, there are products out
there that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those are more bacterial that are
kind of fighting the fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of these, this,
um, actinivate, you know, that's a product
[SPEAKER_00]: that, um, but it's bacterial and that's
fighting off the fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's such a good question,
but I do remember this one little project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I did when I was living in Hawaii with
a friend and he was really into IMO fours
[SPEAKER_00]: and, um, you know, his knowledge is so
much greater than mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to try to explain
anything like that, but we were traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: around to these coffee plantations that
had this, um, pathogenic fungi that
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred on the coffee leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made a solution of the IMO four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to say exactly which
component maybe was fighting, but we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just sprayed this on the coffee,
um, you know, trees that had this fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: infection and came back and scored it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that we scored, there was a
significant impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reduction of that fungal infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know IMO fours don't just contain
fungi, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, it was a fun little
project, but still kind of hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not really sure of the research on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I think that that your answer
points to two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, for folks who are interested
in, in, well, cannabis, but, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, fungal networks in general,
um, and are just kind of coming up,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, and, and, and through
university, there is a lot of research
[SPEAKER_02]: around cannabis and soil science and
fungus to be had.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is, this is a great time to
become, you know, have an interest in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and become and becoming out of
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then the second thing that
your answer points out is, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're always talking about the
power of, of, of industrial indigenous
[SPEAKER_02]: microorganisms here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And IMO four, uh, you know, while it has
got a significant representation of fungus
[SPEAKER_02]: in it, it's this magical combination of
nature that just, just rebalances things
[SPEAKER_02]: like in your example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and you know, so many of us,
uh, container based cannabis growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, we struggle with, with Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anytime I talk to somebody who focuses
their work on, on the root zone,
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of ask everybody, Hey, do you have
a good solution for Fusarium?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and, you know, everybody kind of
says this same thing, like, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, the research hasn't
actually found a really good one yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally you should just replace your
soil, but, but this is the first time that
[SPEAKER_02]: IMO four has been brought up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be interesting if, if somebody
were to have, you know, say, and say like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like an installed, you know, large scale
bed where it would be a real pain in the
[SPEAKER_02]: butt to replace the soil, unlike,
you know, like a 20 gallon pot or
[SPEAKER_02]: something, which is really easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, doing a, doing a significant
application of IMO four might be one,
[SPEAKER_02]: might be one Fusarium solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't want to get too distracted
off on the Fusarium thing, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: but while we, while we're there,
um, you know, I figured we might as well
[SPEAKER_02]: hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, all right, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so, so now that we are
understanding what the mycelium networks
[SPEAKER_02]: are doing and that they are, are breaking
down nutrition and bringing it back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the rhizosphere where, where,
um, I guess I'll say, for the moment it
[SPEAKER_02]: gets handed off to mycorrhizae that does
the exchange with the plant that we will
[SPEAKER_02]: pick up on set two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead and take our first short
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we come back, we will start
talking about mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is mycologist Stephanie
Garcia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please support them and let them know
you've heard of them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_02]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volcani
[SPEAKER_02]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_02]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-I-C-O.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaping fire listeners can get 10% off any
size of Dynomyco on Amazon or Dynomyco.com

[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots, or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_02]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've heard me talk about the
award-winning cannabis seeds that come
[SPEAKER_02]: from the analytical breeding program of
Seth and Eric Crawford, who founded Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, Seth was a guest on Shaping Fire
in 2020 to talk about triploid genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC
seeds for home growers and farms as Grow
[SPEAKER_02]: the Revolution Seeds at gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their high THC seeds are extraordinary in
that they will start to flower at 16 and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half hours of daylight instead of the
typical 14 and a half hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means in most regions, your plants
will start to flower outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle of July instead of the middle of
August, which means these photo period
[SPEAKER_02]: plants finish in September and not
October, totally upending the photo period
[SPEAKER_02]: seed market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth and Eric took their prized early
flowering CBG line and bred it to some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the most desired verified genetics out
there, including Sour Diesel, Triangle
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush, Wedding Cake, Chem Dog, Skittles,
and others.
[SPEAKER_02]: These crosses all express powerful photo
period terpene profiles and THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: giving you a great high.
[SPEAKER_02]: GTR seeds has a new THC-V line with plants
like Double Durbin and Gigantor that boast
[SPEAKER_02]: one-to-one THC to THC-V, and people want
that THC-V.
[SPEAKER_02]: GTR seeds are very consistent,
true-growing inbred F1s from stabilized
[SPEAKER_02]: inbred parent lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: These seeds are new and nearly homogenous,
and the plants should all grow the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is only one phenotype in every pack,
available as diploids and triploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth and Eric's company is still
family-owned, patient and
[SPEAKER_02]: employee-centric, and partially powered by
their two acres of solar panels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone can purchase these seeds and the
entire catalog of Oregon CBD seeds at

something revolutionary for your next
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor or outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Online cannabis seed distributors often
seem to be all the same, but Multiverse
[SPEAKER_02]: Beans constantly works to provide you with
cannabis seeds and a buying experience
[SPEAKER_02]: that you won't find elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiverse Beans works directly with the
breeders to secure as many packs of your
[SPEAKER_02]: favorites as possible so that they have
your favorite beans long after others have
[SPEAKER_02]: sold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some shops simply buy breeder minimums,
but I get messages all the time from
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders saying some version of Multiverse
asked to buy my entire run.
[SPEAKER_02]: At multiversebeans.com, you can find rare
cannabis seeds from night owl seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: including the Dark Owl sublabel,
Mephisto Genetics, Square One Genetics,

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Lose, and my guest
today is mycologist Stephanie Garcia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during the first set, we learned all
about mycelium and that it is also not
[SPEAKER_02]: saprophytic fungus and all of the
wonderful things that mycelium do first
[SPEAKER_02]: for itself, then for the plant,
but then also for everybody else who hangs
[SPEAKER_02]: out in the in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're going to talk specifically
about the symbiotic relationship between
[SPEAKER_02]: mycelium networks and plants that are
expressed through through mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we touched on mycorrhizae a bit at the
beginning of the first set to separate
[SPEAKER_02]: endomycorrhizae and ectomycorrhizae based
on how they interact differently with the
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone, with the roots themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with how does mycorrhizae
colonize the plant root system of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: From from what I understand, you know,
there is a point when a when a plant is,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, new or young, where it is
not, it is not fully colonized by
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizae, by by fungus that is is is,
boy, it's hard to talk about it once once
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizae is not a noun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's a description of a symbiotic
relationship, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different way to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so how does how do you talk about it,
Stephanie?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like how do you talk about it in
in in as a professional who talks about
[SPEAKER_02]: this all day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I guess you could,
you know, instead of maybe just focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: on the mycorrhizae or mycorrhizal fungi,
you can say the mycorrhizal hyphae or the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using the word mycorrhizae as a as a as
a description of of of the type of fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so it would be appropriate to say,
you know, Stephanie, would you explain to
[SPEAKER_02]: us how mycorrhizae fungi colonize the
plant root system of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so when we think about the beginning of
the symbiosis, we first want to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves, how is this hyphae growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is this coming from?
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now in nature, hyphae is the greatest,
let's say, propagule that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we say propagule, we're
talking about if we think about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: a propagule for cannabis is its seed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about fungi, there can be a
few different types of propagules and
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically our muscular mycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in nature, hyphae or mycelium is the
greatest propagule in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can start with we can start with
fragments of mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can start with spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing that would be
considered a propagule, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to propagate this life form
and however it propagates, it should be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to then become an adult or,
you know, go past this vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got, we've covered the mycelium,
the spore, and then our muscular
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi are interesting in that
pieces of root or we can call root
[SPEAKER_00]: fragments that previously contained or
were colonized by the our muscular
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi can also act as a
propagule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these structures that are
inside the root like hyphae are produced
[SPEAKER_00]: within the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can also act as propagules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were incorporating some
mycorrhizal inoculum into your growth
[SPEAKER_00]: system, you're going to have some of these
propagules you put, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're probably going off this label
recommendation to my understanding,
[SPEAKER_00]: there aren't any products currently in the
US that claim mycelium as a propagule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that has something to do more
with shelf life, possibly with how you
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify it, you know, how it can be
regulated, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So primarily, if you were to like,
let's say get some mycorrhizal inoculum
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at it under the microscope,
you're going to see I see spores and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll probably see pieces of root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to start with that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that, the mycelium will
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be growing, you know,
within your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of research about,
you know, the signaling that goes on for
[SPEAKER_00]: these fungi and how do they actually
connect with the plant root, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really fascinating stuff because
way back when it was really understood or
[SPEAKER_00]: thought, you know, believed that the plant
regulated the symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that plants release through
exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there's a lot of other types
of biochemical signaling going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now some of the people researching
this signaling are realizing that it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more complex than we thought initially
and that potentially the fungi has a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more say in how it connects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to think of it like, you know,
the plant is there, the fungus approaches
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's trying to get into a party and
the plant's like, okay, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can bring in nutrients, you could
bring in beverages for me or you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I was taught too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like come on in and why would the plant
not want to accept that it's almost like
[SPEAKER_00]: an insurance policy for the plant that
it's going to be getting enough nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, water and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there's some, you know,
research going on to say that there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot more complex communication
between the fungi and the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do know that root exudates are
released I think we're still really trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand root exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know currently there's about 100,000
compounds that have been identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that roots are putting out
there, but we know that they play a role
[SPEAKER_00]: in the germination of spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for that ultimate connection,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, once the once the mycelium
approaches the root there's a very complex
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately they're able to
penetrate into the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually a physical penetration.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not just like symbolic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually, you know, because of the size
relationship, the mycelium strands can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually enter the root itself,
not just the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was even just today we were looking
for these special structures that they
[SPEAKER_00]: make when they penetrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hyphopodium and it's a just small
piece of tissue and it anchors the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelium to the root itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it completely penetrates that
and just continues to to explore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this idea of these
endomycorrhizae spending some part of
[SPEAKER_02]: their life inside the plant root totally
reminds me of the bacterial rhizophagy
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle that we discussed in detail with
Jeff Lowenfeld back on Shaping Fire 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, are these two, I don't know,
areas of science related in science at
[SPEAKER_02]: all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just in my head because they're
just two different things that enter the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant for part of their life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think everything's connected in,
you know, in ways like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that there's a lot of research
on now what they're, I don't know if this
[SPEAKER_00]: is really a term that's been coined,
but mycorrhizae helper bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think things are definitely working
synergistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, I think that that's a fair
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about one of the one of the
the roles that the mycorrhizae play in
[SPEAKER_02]: this in this relationship with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one that I ever learned about,
and I'm certainly not suggesting I know a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot about it, is the the sugar water for
the sugar and water for minerals exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you walk us through that that like
cornerstone process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that really is at the heart of
this exchange at the heart of this
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked a little bit in the earlier
segment about how mycorrhizal fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are reliant on the plant host for
their carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all coming through
photosynthates through that photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really what the fungus wants
from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that some fungi can exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the mycorrhizal fungi can exist
without the plant host.
[SPEAKER_00]: But primarily, most of these species are
dependent on their carbon acquisition
[SPEAKER_00]: through photos and photosynthes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really what they're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant is willing to engage in this
relationship because they know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they somehow know that the
fungi is able to deliver different and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just the, you know, more mineral
or micronutrients, but even
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know that the if they allow this
relationship to occur, that they're also
[SPEAKER_00]: going to benefit in this other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that maybe they wouldn't be able to do
as well on their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess when somebody shows up with all of
these, you know, quality inputs,
[SPEAKER_02]: you you're all you get used to it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why would you not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you say no?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Kent, does does mycorrhizae have the
ability to live in the soil without a root
[SPEAKER_02]: or something of some root or other in
order to do this symbiotic exchange?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, it might not be cannabis,
but perhaps it's, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a dandelion or something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But can the mycorrhizal fungus survive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Without a root?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many species that are obligate
mycorrhizal fungi, so they have to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant host to carry out their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if they didn't have access to a
plant, can they go dormant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how long would that last?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we know that there are many
fungi, many mycorrhizal fungi that they
[SPEAKER_00]: just simply cannot carry out their life
cycle without their plant host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to need that root system.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: While preparing and doing my background
research for the episode, it was really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting to read all the different I'll
just throw my guess in a big basket of
[SPEAKER_02]: processes that mycorrhizal fungi are able
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, that cornerstone sugar
waters for mineral exchange, I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like picturing this mycorrhizae in the
middle, like, you know, kind of acting
[SPEAKER_02]: like a bartering agent, you know,
going, hey, you got those there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got those here, I'll give those here,
okay, all right, go, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like directing traffic almost,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then as you continue to read,
it's like, oh, also, mycorrhizae can do
[SPEAKER_02]: this chemical transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, if it finds this,
it can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, the more I read, I'm like,
mycorrhizae has got this whole toolbox of
[SPEAKER_02]: biological transitions and trades,
I guess that it can do to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: the signals and the nutrition and the
water and everything is all being
[SPEAKER_02]: transferred back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to tell you that that it kind of
makes them pretty badass because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially making their own tools,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all these different things that
they can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you explain some of the ways that
mycorrhizae defends the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_02]: itself from like disease and pathogens
and, and other things that might do the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant harm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, it really is fascinating when
you when you think about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one reason I just think the
kingdom fungi is so incredible and why we
[SPEAKER_00]: do need more people to step into the
field, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how it also like when you start
reading it, it really does start to read
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's intelligent, you know,
like it really like it's really amazing,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially when you like see like a tick
tock or something that shows fungus like
[SPEAKER_02]: beating puzzles and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, damn, you know,
so anyway, please, please, how does the
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizae actually defend the cannabis
plants from diseases and pathogens by
[SPEAKER_02]: using these various methods it has?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, there's a few things that come
to mind right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would say that overall,
if you have a plant that's receiving,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, more water, more nutrients than
the plants able to acquire on its own,
[SPEAKER_00]: your the plant health overall is just
going to be better, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just going to have a more robust
plant, a plant that's maybe more resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: to an infection, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing that just comes to
mind right away is that if your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: overall is more healthy, then it's going
to be able to fight off different things
[SPEAKER_00]: that might come its way.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that is pretty well researched
is tolerance to not only things like
[SPEAKER_00]: saline soils, but also heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if for some reason that is happening
for you, the fungi, they can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate how that is delivered to the
plant and essentially hold it within its
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like pockets it away, so that away from
the mechanics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so that the plant is shielded from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, outside of cannabis growing or you
know, things like that, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: saline soils and, you know, in our world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some experiments where we were
just straight feeding and plant saltwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, you know, mycorrhizal colonized
plants are just, they just look so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we haven't done too much on the
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's there's quite a bit of
research on heavy metal uptake and
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigation of those heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's really an
interesting aspect and things that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can do for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there is other research on
prevention of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if that's just due to an
increase in overall plant health or if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some other mechanism behind that
that we don't fully understand yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at the next question I have for
you, I have a feeling that this is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be one that you say, ah, shango,
that's for saprophytic fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to go ahead and ask you
anyway, because I'm super curious of the
[SPEAKER_02]: answer, even if it is saprophytic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so so I was going to ask you that,
you know, cannabis cultivators love ground
[SPEAKER_02]: cover and companion plants for lots of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: One being that, you know, the plants can
all talk to each other and trade nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, create pests defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was going to say, would you
explain how mycelium, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: processes the signaling system?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's probably not mycelium in
retrospect, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm having a hard time
understanding on the signaling system
[SPEAKER_00]: between the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like, like we hear about when groups
of plants, even if they're different
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties are planted together,
you know, that an aphids will attack one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants will signal to the other local
plants that it's getting chomped on by
[SPEAKER_02]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the individual plants can use whatever
its strategy is to not get aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't really know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't necessarily give all this
saprophytic fungi credit for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it definitely tells me that,
like, you know, since you study
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizae and you don't know this
particular thing that that I definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: have put this activity in the wrong
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there is some signaling of
infection from tree to tree that are
[SPEAKER_00]: colonized, you know, by fungi and to,
you know, increase defenses or transfer
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients over here because now this plant
is infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that there's communication in
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't put it past that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know if I could speak to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more we talk today, the more I get
this sense that mycelium is more about
[SPEAKER_02]: transport and breaking down nutrition and
moving it on a highway towards the root
[SPEAKER_02]: zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when the nutrition gets to the root
zone, the mycorrhizae symbiosis with the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant kind of takes over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And does the actual barter transmutation
or process of bringing that nutrition into
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant through this mutualistic
relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the plant is then, you know,
sending the nutrients that it's sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: back down to the mycorrhizae activity
mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that goes back down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would like to know, is there
anything physiologically different at that
[SPEAKER_02]: connection point between the mycelium and
the plant root?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we would say, oh, that's mycorrhizal
fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell by looking at it versus does
it just look like regular mycelium that's
[SPEAKER_02]: just doing a different activity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're looking at the mycelium
itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I don't think I could
really tell a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting because the way
that all of us, I mean, and we cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: people, we talk about a lot of stuff
wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we always talk, we talk about,
you know, mycorrhizal fungi as if it is
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, an absolutely different
type of fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more we talk, the more that I
realize that kind of as an industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: we talk about it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I will say with, like,
ectomycorrhizal fungi, we talked a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about this mantle of mycelium that
covers the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can certainly find roots like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can know for sure, like,
this is mycelium that is from,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an ectomycorrhizal fungi,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very obvious where the
endomycorrhizal fungi or AMF, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more tricky because they don't
make this like mantle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this mat of mycelium over the
root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is that, you know, I just like
kind of have that thought in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, if you saw this mat of
mycelium next to your plant and next to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant roots, and that would be hard
for me to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless I went, I collected some roots,
and then I went through the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: clearing the pigmentation, staining it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then visualizing it under the scope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you were done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just, you know, to make sure that
this was the mycorrhizal fungi that was
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for all that other mycelium I
saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to distinguish it, yeah, I think would
be kind of challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to end this second set, I just want to
ask you one ectomycorrhizae question,
[SPEAKER_02]: because when I read this preparing for the
show, it caught me way off guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to learn more about this
if you know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read that ectomycorrhizae have been
known to lure springtails to obtain
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: How the heck does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about that,
but I'm certainly going to look into that
[SPEAKER_00]: after this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever heard, outside of this
particular example, have you ever come
[SPEAKER_02]: across examples of mycorrhizae acting like
they are trapping anything like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when we learned how aphids farm
and things like, or no, no, it's the ants
[SPEAKER_02]: farm the aphid larva.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some really interesting stuff to
happen at that level of biology,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so have you heard of any other
examples of mycorrhizae doing that sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it makes me think of like
corniceps and how that can drive certain
[SPEAKER_00]: insects, like it can take over the
neurological system, drive them to the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the canopy, eventually consume them
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't ever heard that with the ectos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know that ectos have a lot more
claims to prevent like, let's say insect
[SPEAKER_00]: herbivory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's just because that
mantle is, you know, covering the root
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like this physical shield of
defense for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just knowing that there are other
mechanisms like the cordyceps,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm kind of a romantic when it
comes to fungi, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, they can do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely curious about what you
read there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I want to look into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not something I'm really aware
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got it just from an article I
found through Wikipedia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's there if you want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it is really interesting,
too, to look at all the different tools
[SPEAKER_02]: that the mycorrhizae has.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's got different processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got barters that it can be in the
middle of to get what it needs to get
[SPEAKER_02]: done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's got like the soil version
of like, you know, chemical signals and
[SPEAKER_02]: smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may or may not be root terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea of like all these different
tools it's got, I imagine like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, yeah, the ectomycorrhizae is,
you know, excreting some chemical that
[SPEAKER_02]: springtails love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it gets close enough,
I imagine like, how the hell does a how
[SPEAKER_02]: does fungus move fast enough to catch a
springtail?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but again, you already said you
don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to not wonder, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it kind of just reminds me of
enzymes that are released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they are these types of like
digestive enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of them like that to break
down the, you know, non biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but yeah, when you think about how slow
the fungi move, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one reason I like them, they just like
stay put.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, that's that's a good
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we'll have to we'll we'll have
to try to get somebody that's listening in
[SPEAKER_00]: to enlist in a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: project on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead and take our second
commercial break.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is mycologist Stephanie
Garcia.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options and who to choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_02]: ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend gas lamp seeds to my friends and
[SPEAKER_02]: listeners who are looking for a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably already know gas lamp seeds
as HEMBRA genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: HEMBRA recently changed their name to gas
lamp seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gas lamp seeds is not just another seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gas lamp is a female operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: With over 60 breeders and over a thousand
strains to choose from, you will certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: find something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gas lamp seeds has something for everyone
with over 650 feminized strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: 300 regular varieties and over 200 auto
flowers to choose from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Names you know you can trust like compound
genetics, Humboldt seed company,
[SPEAKER_02]: night owl, in-house, fast buds,
gnome automatics and ethos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money but have no
[SPEAKER_02]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invited gas lamp to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_02]: about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have A plus customer service with
lightning fast response times.
[SPEAKER_02]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will get
your order out the same day you place it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most seed banks are simply not this
organized or interested in getting your
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds to you so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But gas lamp seeds cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: You even get free seeds with every order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helene and Caitlin get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have been in the cannabis growing
scene for over a decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Want some extra freebies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the code shapingfire all one word at
checkout and they will give you an
[SPEAKER_02]: additional set of gas lamp provided
freebies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an extra $30 in free seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy seeds from good folks who will send
you great seeds reliably every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Visit gaslampseeds.com today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gaslamp seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis seed market is filled with
big name and hype breeders fighting to get
[SPEAKER_02]: your attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And occasionally you discover a breeder
who is breeding because it is the only
[SPEAKER_02]: thing they care to do and they would be
doing it even if they never made a dime.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my friend, Craig Hartzah,
who makes seeds as magnetic genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Craig comes from five generations of
farmers and is earning his master's degree
[SPEAKER_02]: in horticulture right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been growing cannabis for 15 years
and been breeding for nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hasn't sold many seeds because he
really isn't a sales guy, but I've
[SPEAKER_02]: personally been growing his seeds for
years and I know I can always rely on his
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds to germinate, thrive, and smell and
taste great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suggested to Craig that he should
probably sell some seeds and asked if he
[SPEAKER_02]: had enough stockpiled to bother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much to my shock, he was sitting on five
full menus in cold storage that he
[SPEAKER_02]: produced in the last two years and hadn't
even tried to sell any of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was simply too busy breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we his friends convinced him to make
his damn seeds available to the people and
[SPEAKER_02]: now they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the first time anywhere, you can now
buy magnetic genetic seeds at Neptune Seed
[SPEAKER_02]: Bank and on strainly.io.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neptune Seed Bank has just picked up
magnetic genetics for a trial to gauge
[SPEAKER_02]: your interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are carrying three strains from his
mean mug prominence and turpinado menus
[SPEAKER_02]: which are exclusive to Neptune.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an easy way to score his seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pick up those menus plus his
hillbilly skunk and candy breath crosses
[SPEAKER_02]: and more on his profile page on strainly
.io.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want very affordable seeds that are
exceptional quality with rare terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles from a good guy, go to
neptuneseedbank.com or strainly.io.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it is fun to buy the hype thing
from the brand you admire, but when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: ready to buy the strain you'll love from
an obscure mad scientist, you're ready for
[SPEAKER_02]: magnetic genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Magneticgenetics.org and on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Magneticgenetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of good people launching
new businesses in cannabis, psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_02]: and other psychedelics and it's a very
strange time for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the same moment that psilocybin
mushrooms are illegal at the federal
[SPEAKER_02]: level, they are becoming increasingly
legal in states across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: These businesses leading the way into the
future of plant medicines require
[SPEAKER_02]: specialized legal representation by
attorneys who have depth not only in
[SPEAKER_02]: litigation, mergers, and acquisitions,
but also in psychedelic and other plant
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Light Law Group has been empowering
cannabis businesses since 2014 and as the
[SPEAKER_02]: market has diversified into psilocybin and
other plant medicines, Green Light has
[SPEAKER_02]: been right there, evolving with their
diverse clients to provide legal expertise
[SPEAKER_02]: with a high level of legal acumen,
creative strategy, and precision that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes with an intimate and specific
understanding of both business law and
[SPEAKER_02]: plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a business owner trying to
navigate the layered local and national
[SPEAKER_02]: drug laws on your own, you are at risk of
fumbling.
[SPEAKER_02]: These confusing and quickly changing laws
complicate everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Light Law Group is ready to help you
when hit with a lawsuit or because you
[SPEAKER_02]: were shafted by a vendor or business
partner or simply because you want to stay
[SPEAKER_02]: legal and could use some preventative
guidance before cultivating a controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: substance as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Light Law Group is a collection of
folks who care profoundly about their work

folks from Green Light.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a huge difference between a big
legal firm who has decided to start
[SPEAKER_02]: representing a few drug companies versus
working with a collection of high
[SPEAKER_02]: integrity, passionate lawyers who are
personally interested in new plant
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines and firmly believe in their
power to heal.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Shangalos, and my guest
today is mycologist, Stephanie Garcia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are in the third set.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the first set, we talked about
mycelium networks and the roles they do
[SPEAKER_02]: and don't play in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we talked about mycorrhizae
symbiosis between the mycelium and the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and all the myriad tools that
mycorrhizae have got in the toolbox to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to do all the very various processes
that they're responsible for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here in set three, we're going to
talk about supporting mycelium and the
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizae symbiosis in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk about some best
practices and maybe some less than best
[SPEAKER_02]: practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Stephanie, today we've been mostly
talking about living soil because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly what Shaping Fire talks about as a
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But lots of cannabis growers use soilless
mediums like cocoa coir and peat or
[SPEAKER_02]: rockwool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do mycelium networks grow in these other
non-living soil mediums?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, they certainly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you say they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because you don't have as complex of a
biological environment in some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: soilless mediums as you would have in
living soil, do they present themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: differently or are there only particular
strains of mycelium that can take to that
[SPEAKER_02]: environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm wrong, but it just seems to me
that with so much less of the biology that
[SPEAKER_02]: happens in living soil that's not in
cocoa, peat, and rockwool, that there
[SPEAKER_02]: would be some kind of differences between
how mycelium and mycorrhizae present
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves, but perhaps it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think one thing we've done,
we've done a few hydroponic studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: not with cannabis, but I know that there
have also been some hydroponic studies in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis with mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that they're able to establish
in that type of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe they're not as reliant on the
nutrients because they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: communicating with the plant roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in these studies that I've read
about with cannabis that they've shown to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase plant vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, I would think that they would
act somewhat different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the benefit to the plant,
these studies suggested that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: still able to perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to ask about water and mycelium
networks again, but not like what we
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about a water earlier about how
mycelium helps create good soil structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: which allows the water to get through it
and how by it retaining water,
[SPEAKER_02]: it helps the plant not dry out in drought
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does all these really good water
retention aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk more about we as
cultivators watering the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can imagine that, like anything,
even water that is helpful can be become
[SPEAKER_02]: dangerous if it's given too much of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I imagine that if we over water,
it'll cause the mycelium networks to rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if we under water, maybe they'll
dry out and cyst up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're not working either.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as cultivators, we kind of want to
get this sweet spot somewhere in the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle, where we're providing enough water
for everything to thrive, but not enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to throw the mycelium network out of
balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you have any advice around that for
us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think one thing to consider is that
the mycorrhizal fungi, they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: really good at helping the plants resist
drought, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of mechanisms they have
where the mycorrhizae helps store the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also explore for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not, I think, as big of an issue
for them to be a little bit underwatered,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to perform, the plants seem to
perform really well with a reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's been a lot of research,
and we've done a little research with the
[SPEAKER_00]: group I'm with on watering them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people would suggest you don't
have to water as much if you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: have this mycorrhizal association going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really sure how people would feel
about that, reducing their watering and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that if they have these root
systems established, then they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: really well equipped to face that,
you know, the stresses of drought,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can bounce back even if water
becomes less and less available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a really good example of
why mature soil environments, like whether
[SPEAKER_02]: it's in a pot or a bed or like a raised
bed or something, that mature soils with
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of fungal networks that are mature
are just really going to give you a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more of a buffer as a cultivator because
it's more flexible than a pot that we just
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed some soil and threw it in and put
our clone in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that pot is going to be,
have much fewer defenses than a mature pot
[SPEAKER_02]: that's packed with mycelium networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even thinking about this
over watering, just like we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the, you know, saline soil and the
heavy metal or, you know, heavy metal
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake mitigation, the mycelium can also
help with uptake mitigation of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say you're over watering, I think
mycelium is really good at holding that
[SPEAKER_00]: and just helping to deliver this like
really nice amount of water to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not saying you can over water,
but mycelium is just going to take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have to be conscientious of
that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your bandwidth of success is going to
be wider with more mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more, or one other question about
water quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the pH water or how much mineral
content it has on it have any impact on
[SPEAKER_02]: the mycelium networks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they don't, you know, they're
similar to other things that we grow where
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of want that neutral pH,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see responses if they have a really
low pH or really high pH that they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: colonize and they don't perform very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had this idea, which is not
scientific, just based on observation,
[SPEAKER_02]: that I wonder whether or not high mineral
water would be more difficult for mycelium
[SPEAKER_02]: to transport because of its high mineral
nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of it as like chunky water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And perhaps the mycelium either needs to
A, separate out the minerals that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: the water or B, just refuses to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything to offer on this idea
of mineral water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the only thing I would imagine is if
I was the fungal hyphae, even if I was the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelium in there and the water was too
chunky for me to deal with, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably try to secrete some enzymes to
break it down to make it easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's an interesting theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after we break up the soil,
say for example, you know, we tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: encourage no-till as a general idea,
but sometimes we're in positions where we
[SPEAKER_02]: just want to refresh a pot and we want to
pop out the soil and we want to break it
[SPEAKER_02]: up and maybe we amend it and then maybe
we're putting it in a new pot because our
[SPEAKER_02]: pots are getting old and janky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the soil is aged soil and until we
broke it up, it had a pretty complex
[SPEAKER_02]: mycelium network.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we broke it up and so now we've
got all these propagule strands,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were telling us earlier how any
one of those strands can start a new
[SPEAKER_02]: network.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long would you suggest that it's going
to take from the day that I pop out the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and break it up and amend it and put
it back into a pot until those pieces of
[SPEAKER_02]: mycelium find each other and get
themselves reassociated and then are
[SPEAKER_02]: functioning and doing their job again?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this scenario, we're thinking of
you've replanted a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a plant in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a cannabis start in there is
the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that if we're growing these fungi
in vitro, culture, so if we're in the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this, this can take a couple weeks,
two to three weeks before the plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, before the plant and the fungi come
together and create that symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this one study I'm thinking about,
and it was with cannabis, it was about,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was suggested that it's about six
weeks, but that there were these benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: that were noticed even ahead of that time,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we run our bioassays, we usually
let it go eight weeks and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: timeline that we've stuck with to see this
was a really good colonized root system,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we know that in those lab
conditions, everything is like perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have this spore right next to
this root organ culture and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting like we're putting it right in
this like perfect condition, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run those bioassays for eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a study here that says six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little more challenging if you
have something that doesn't go very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of our hydroponic studies,
for example, we were looking at lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, after a month of growing lettuce
hydroponically, it's time to harvest it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really hard for us to find
really good colonization throughout and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the, like this huge root biomass
that it produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think we generally tell people
to that you wouldn't see any type of
[SPEAKER_00]: effects for, you know, three or four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's exactly what I was going for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the follow up is I really think that
this makes a case that if we are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: do any kind of that rejuvenation of pots
where we're going to be breaking up mature
[SPEAKER_02]: pots, mending them, maybe re-soiling some
and then putting them back in that we
[SPEAKER_02]: really want to do that either much earlier
in the spring or even the prior fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in either case, either add like a
small cover crop, a lot of small plants or
[SPEAKER_02]: or maybe like a or maybe like comfrey or
something to be a placeholder for our
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plant so that by the time,
you know, end of May comes and we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: start planting our cannabis starts into
the soil, that that work of reconnecting
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the mycelial strands has already
been done because as as you and I are
[SPEAKER_02]: discussing it, you know, a lot of people
will will break up the pots, do the
[SPEAKER_02]: amendment, fill up the pots and then and
then put their cannabis plants in there
[SPEAKER_02]: within a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that tells me that through at least,
you know, most of their veg period,
[SPEAKER_02]: that plant is living in a sub optimum
living environment because the mycelium
[SPEAKER_02]: mycelium networks are broken at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about some of these,
like, you know, we're we're more in this
[SPEAKER_00]: like agricultural, I mean, more in this
agricultural type industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about regenerative ag,
I mean, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're trying for minimal
disturbance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No till or strip tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can't do that, OK, you can't do
that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But like what you're saying makes so much
sense because you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do your amendments, do whatever,
you know, you're you're thinking you
[SPEAKER_00]: really need to do to the soil and then
plant that cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, having living roots, even with
your crop, right, relieving this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: compaction and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with like crop diversity,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like a rotation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of want to get away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always planted this one plant in this
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes the nutrients different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then try to replenish it with like a
type of cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one thing I was thinking when
you were saying this was and asking these
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and something that just kind of
came to mind is it's really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: that we will we'll let these bioassays go
for eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's been so many experiences I've
had where I inoculate in transplant and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a clear impact of a reduction of
transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's I'm not really sure exactly what
that's due to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this some type of carrier effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does somehow the plant know this fungus is
there and they're releasing some other
[SPEAKER_00]: types of root exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's something that I've witnessed
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And applying my grizzle fungi and this
inoculum is you see this transplant shock
[SPEAKER_00]: like resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just something interesting to
me, because if we don't see that symbiosis
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring for however long it might not
occur for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we're still seeing some type of
positive impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes me wonder what else is going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, below the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, more more room for research for the
people coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there specific soil amendments that
either help or hinder mycelium and the
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizae symbiosis?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the answer may just be,
well, keep your soil generally balanced
[SPEAKER_02]: and healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but there also could be like some
amendment that you're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a key building block, you know,
for mycelium networks and you should make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that you add this or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we've read some literature
about biochar being helpful and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, increasing colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we really avoid having
anything really high in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high phosphorus contents can really
reduce the level of colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just say to consider definitely
consider the phosphorus content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting because mycorrhizal fungi
are so wonderful at acquiring phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like their flagship nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you plant it and if you plant this
plant in this really phosphorus rich
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, the mycorrhizal fungi doesn't
establish maybe because it thinks why do I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my job would be redundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of research on on on
phosphorus levels, and even fertilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lower P when when that's becoming
established, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I and I've got a fertilizer question
to follow up that with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, while we focus mostly on natural
farming techniques on shaping fire,
[SPEAKER_02]: many folks choose the ease of using,
you know, salt based fertilizers and A
[SPEAKER_02]: plus B kind of stuff for indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do these sort of like sodium
fertilizers impact mycelium and the
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizal symbiosis in any way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we you know, I can't I don't know
really, but I know that we had to use some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that material in our hydroponics study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lettuce that study wasn't as
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also worked with basil and it
seemed to still, you know, it's still it
[SPEAKER_00]: was still able to work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just made sure that the P was low
because that's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so to kind of wrap this up a little
bit, you know, this, the more I prepared
[SPEAKER_02]: for this show, the more complex I realized
that my mycelium networks and mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: symbiosis is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I was like, you know,
you know, a couple days into into building
[SPEAKER_02]: my question path for this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, holy crap, this is like two
episodes, like, and and a college course,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's so much here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you, of course, as somebody who's
dedicated themselves to studying fungus
[SPEAKER_02]: knows this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so as kind of a wrap up, there are
there are certainly things that that I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't ask you because I didn't know to
ask you because I don't have the the depth
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and if our goal with this show was to,
you know, have cannabis cultivators be
[SPEAKER_02]: more aware of mycelium networks,
to consider them more and and how to
[SPEAKER_02]: support them when they are growing either
in beds or in containers and then and then
[SPEAKER_02]: and then understand the mycorrhizal
symbiosis and the importance of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so we continually, you know,
respect the role that that the living soul
[SPEAKER_02]: is playing soil is playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you say is that something that
I may have missed that would be helpful to
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators in in making sure they've got
healthy and functioning mycelial networks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I think you asked some
amazing questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you covered things really
well as I mean, everything from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelium to describing mycorrhizal fungi,
their role, everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing that we didn't
necessarily touch on was just mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: products and not to put any not going to
put any type of plugs in there for any
[SPEAKER_00]: particular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would tell people to be aware
of is label claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're if you want to incorporate
mycorrhizal fungi by going out and buying
[SPEAKER_00]: a product, look at the claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just look at this soil contains
mycorrhizae because one thing I've really
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed through my time with with the
company I'm working with now is there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of products out there that will claim
we have mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at their claim,
it's extremely low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if you're having a
fraction of a fraction of a propagule for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a cubic inch of soil,
like that's really not going to do you any
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware that there are a lot of
products out there that might have a
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really low claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you may think you're introducing
mycorrhizal fungi through soils or
[SPEAKER_00]: different inoculums, but just try to
educate yourself on on the levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see something coming in at a
fraction of a propagule, it's probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: delivering what you're hoping it will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really insightful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that you added that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, this is this is also
something that we talk about when we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about microbe communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's there's all these like,
you know, new to the market, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: microbe community infusion products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and and and and people just buy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because they like the marketing of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, you know, you know, if somebody
with a with a bio biology background looks
[SPEAKER_02]: at the label, they're all like,
you know, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, and and and I think
it's it's all it's good for all of us to
[SPEAKER_02]: be savvy and a bit skeptical consumers
when it comes to, you know, science that
[SPEAKER_02]: we may not may not be entirely familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really with all of our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but and, you know, even questioning,
even seeing claims that you think are,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool, this seems like a decent enough
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of over inoculating as long as the carrier
isn't going to cause any type of
[SPEAKER_00]: phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes companies will say,
you know, apply this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what's best, you know,
on the business aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm I'm a bit more of a fan of giving
it a little extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another another good point to know your
carrier, know what your filler products
[SPEAKER_02]: are in whatever products you're using.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so Stephanie, thank you so much for
spending your time with us today and
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing your insight into mycelium
networks and the mycorrhizae symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that I learned a lot, especially
about the mycorrhizae symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when when when, you know,
I really got to wrapping my head around
[SPEAKER_02]: that that it is a process more than a
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, clearly it broke my brain there
and so set one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but, you know, throughout the rest of
the show, I realized that the impacts that
[SPEAKER_02]: that has as far as how I've been taking
care of my own growing containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so so thank you for, you know,
sharing your insight and and your time and
[SPEAKER_02]: your good share with everybody here on
Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're so welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you would like to get in contact
with Stephanie Garcia, you can do so
