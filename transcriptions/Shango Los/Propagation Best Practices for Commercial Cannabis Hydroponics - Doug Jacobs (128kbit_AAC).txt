[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm just going to speak up since
there's no microphone here on the podium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everybody to the 10 30
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Propagation best practices from commercial
scale cultivation for optimal growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would please silence your cell
phones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Shango Loos, host of the Shaping Fire
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like listening to smart interviews
with the top minds in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to check out the show at
shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have an extraordinary YouTube
channel with over 150 speaker videos I've
[SPEAKER_01]: recorded at events just like this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug Jacobs, our speaker, is already on
the channel and will be posting this
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug Jacobs is technical advisor with
Growdown, providing expert consulting on
[SPEAKER_01]: proven precision growing methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has extensive experience with indoor,
outdoor, and greenhouse hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical farms, aquaculture, and CEA
system design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, Doug will be speaking about proven
precision growing methods to optimize crop
[SPEAKER_01]: production using irrigation strategies and
other operational factors to produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: best quality plants using the least amount
of inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told me on the side, we're going to
talk a lot about mothers today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please put it together for Doug Jacobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the excellent introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, my name is Doug Jacobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a technical advisor for Growdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started growing plants probably when I
was a baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: When my parents did orchids and tropicals
in South Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of people in this room,
I probably got involved with cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: early, around 14, 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew a little bit, sold a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really was fascinated by the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got out of it probably right before
legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Started doing urban farming, vegetable
consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Building urban hydroponic farms,
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a lot of cool experiences out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And about four years ago, I started
working for Growdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't think I was going to end up doing
cannabis again, but happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Been spending the last four years helping
to marry commercial vegetable production
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit about Growdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: For 50 years, Growdown has been a leader
in manufacturing hydroponic substrates for
[SPEAKER_02]: the commercial horticulture industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a focus on uniformity and
sustainability, we've developed
[SPEAKER_02]: propagation blocks, plugs, slabs,
loose substrates for tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: cucumbers, peppers, and obviously for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal has been to help increase the
sustainability of our farmers around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using less water, less nutrient,
decreasing labor costs while increasing
[SPEAKER_02]: yield and quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to making growing media,
we have developed tools like the Growdown
[SPEAKER_02]: GrowSense water content sensor that allows
you to manage the water content and EC in
[SPEAKER_02]: the root zone in real time, giving you
insights.
[SPEAKER_02]: This allows you to steer the plant growth,
providing exactly what the plants need to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow, drastically reducing the amount of
water and nutrient to grow those crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to be building on this
knowledge and experience over the next
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of years, increasing these tools
and building substrates specific to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to increase your sustainability
and profitability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today we're going to talk about
uniformity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk a lot about growing
mother plants, taking cuttings,
[SPEAKER_02]: the veg phase, and a little bit about crop
structures, primarily from the tomato
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and how they might be applied to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So uniformity in greenhouse and indoor
farming is a fundamental requirement for
[SPEAKER_02]: making consistent quality plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The farm design and plant care plan should
be developed with uniformity in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is why modern greenhouses are tall,
built to a large footprint, with no
[SPEAKER_02]: internal walls to create differences in
environment, making a uniform climate for
[SPEAKER_02]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heating systems are designed to deliver
heat and irrigation uniformly,
[SPEAKER_02]: and growers left the soil over 50 years
ago to grow and grow again because of
[SPEAKER_02]: improvements in sustainability and
uniformity provided.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say 50 years ago a tomato grower could
get 10 kilograms per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can get almost 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uniformity really starts with mother stock
and propagation because if you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: repeatedly grow a batch of young plants
and steer them correctly from the start,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can maximize production and growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: While all other subsequent inputs,
labor, climate, irrigation, can be
[SPEAKER_02]: optimized, delivering the highest quality
cannabis plants time after time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sourcing mother stock, as you know,
is probably the most important step to
[SPEAKER_02]: creating a uniform crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you're getting rooted cuttings,
seeds, tissue culture, starts,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should take steps to ensure you're not
bringing pests and disease into your
[SPEAKER_02]: grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: A test batch of plants should be operated
and run through a whole life cycle to
[SPEAKER_02]: determine how they perform in your
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should take notes on how these plants
develop at every stage, how they react to
[SPEAKER_02]: pruning, climate, irrigation conditions,
and climate conditions will help you move
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants into production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things, crop registration,
which is not common in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: should be taken on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should find measurements that we need
to take to see, hey, how is this crop
[SPEAKER_02]: developing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it developing differently from the last
time I grew it and why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're not taking these
measurements, you'll never get any
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding on how the crop is
developing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like taking notes on root speed,
quality of the roots, the plant height,
[SPEAKER_02]: stem diameter, leaf and stem color,
node spacing, the natural structure of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking an untapped plant, putting it
into production, see how it develops on
[SPEAKER_02]: its own, and then making decisions on how
to treat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get that plant later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before you can even grow your mother
plants, you have to select a substrate
[SPEAKER_02]: type, determine how much volume is needed
for each mother, an ideal planting
[SPEAKER_02]: density, all of which will define the
irrigation system requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canvas mother plants are typically kept in
large amounts of growing media,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, five to 25 gallons of substrate,
and watered in frequently, usually three
[SPEAKER_02]: to six times per day, if they're lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a carryover from black and gray
market days where you have limited space
[SPEAKER_02]: to commit to your mothers, plant count
restrictions, that limited amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants you could have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's time to sort of relook at this way
of growing mothers and see if there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: better way to get more consistency out of
your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having large mothers and large volumes
of substrates has several drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, it increases the risk of one bad
mom spoiling a whole batch of cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking large amounts of cuttings from a
single plant all at once creates a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: stress on the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cannabis is a very resilient
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You otherwise wouldn't know there's
anything wrong with it just by looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: it most of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But taking, you know, a third or fourth of
the plant off at one time does create a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of stress and has a cascading effect
on all your subsequent cuttings down the
[SPEAKER_02]: road.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, a labor perspective,
large mothers sometimes require workers to
[SPEAKER_02]: get on ladders, work in strained positions
that, you know, increase your liability as
[SPEAKER_02]: growers and owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's time to look at maybe using a
higher density of mothers, smaller mothers
[SPEAKER_02]: and smaller substrates that are more
reactive that you can steer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This increases, this decreases the threat
that one mother would pose to a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: batch of cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And using a smaller volume of substrates
or growing media, especially something
[SPEAKER_02]: like Brodan with a lot of root space,
would allow you to use irrigation as a
[SPEAKER_02]: tool to steer mother growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I talk about crop steering,
for those who haven't been to one of these
[SPEAKER_02]: presentations before, we're talking about
the difference between vegetative and
[SPEAKER_02]: generative growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So vegetative growth, simply put,
I'm growing leaves and stems, focusing on
[SPEAKER_02]: building out the crop, the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where generative growth is I'm focused
more on fruits and flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can use the steering for both
regardless of what stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can be generative in my mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can be generative with my cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can be generative in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can be generative in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can be vegetative in all those stages,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where the problem
starts is that a lot of growers start out
[SPEAKER_02]: generative, end up being vegetative and
end up hurting development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little more detail into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so vegetative irrigation
strategies have typically higher water
[SPEAKER_02]: contents.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have smaller decreases overnight in
smaller drybacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So decreasing water content by,
and you do this by manipulating the start
[SPEAKER_02]: and stop times of irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Irrigation frequency is typically higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think of aeratonic systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more times I can deliver irrigations
to the plant without over-saturating the
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone, the faster I can get it to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: ECs, having lower ECs allowing for easier
uptake of water is more vegetative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then having overall higher substrate
temperatures is more vegetative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then generative on the other side is
lower and decreasing water contents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, being manipulated by the start and
stop times of the irrigations of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Irrigation frequency, though we're
typically delivering the same volumes,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're just taking away the frequency and
just delivering a bigger shot of
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, when I want to be more
vegetative, I have a smaller shot size.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, I'm just changing the way I'm
applying the same amount of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: ECs, typically higher ECs and generative
steering and then substrate temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're mimicking the natural
seasonal change by decreasing the root
[SPEAKER_02]: zone time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light irrigation climate has a significant
effect on how the plants grow and can be
[SPEAKER_02]: used as a tool to steer growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does the lighting type and the
environment affect later stage development
[SPEAKER_02]: plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, switching from fluorescence to
HBS or from LEDs to HBS, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: can cause a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to take note of these and
really see, hey, if I'm going from a lower
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting source to a higher, like,
radiation source, so going from LEDs to
[SPEAKER_02]: HBS, I don't necessarily want to match the
intensities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may want to go lower to prevent stress
from changing these plants from cuttings
[SPEAKER_02]: to veg to flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can you effectively steer mother
plants back and forth to get better
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings faster while at the same time
managing growth so your mothers don't grow
[SPEAKER_02]: out of control?
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when taking your cuttings,
you need to take note of the environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions that you're taking the cuttings
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, having high light intensity,
low humidity while taking the cuttings can
[SPEAKER_02]: affect the cutting quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the mothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want a very active mother under high
light, high humidity, high temperatures
[SPEAKER_02]: when I'm taking the cuttings and then
trying to stick them?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I probably want to reduce my light
intensities at the time I'm taking the
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your growers, your workers will appreciate
this as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I mentioned before, the way cannabis
mother plants are cultivated might need to
[SPEAKER_02]: be revisited.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk briefly about the
method of propagation for chrysanthemum
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers to see how it can be adopted and
applied to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chrysanthemum mother plants are
typically grown at a very high density,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 to 40 plants per square meter,
1.8 to 2.5 plants per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is like seed green.
[SPEAKER_02]: This allows high density mothers to be
grown that will give you typically
[SPEAKER_02]: straighter cuttings, more vigorous
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high density hedge also reduces the
threat of one bad mom affecting a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: batch of cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how does this deliver uniformity?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they're creating the chrysanthemum
mothers, they typically pinch all the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants at the same number of leaf sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they use leaf sets as the determining
factor of when to take the cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: To pinch the first head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the mothers have been planted and
grown for about four weeks until they hit
[SPEAKER_02]: four to five leaves tall, then the head
and the leaf is pinched, creating a
[SPEAKER_02]: uniform crop structure across all the
mothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you see the pinch on the fifth leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keeping the number of leaves and
branches even across all the plants is key
[SPEAKER_02]: to keeping the growth rate the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The low crop structure makes it easier for
growers to harvest the cuttings and ensure
[SPEAKER_02]: you're taking only straight tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 15 to 17 days after the first pinch,
the cuttings are taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all straight tops and have the
highest growth potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this first flush, think of mushrooms,
that first flush of mushrooms is usually
[SPEAKER_02]: the strongest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then subsequent flushes of cuttings can be
taken every week or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: During this process, you may end up with
some taller plants that may need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: trimmed back between and before harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you see here, all the cuttings are
taken in one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really traditionally with
chrysanthemums, they're grown in another
[SPEAKER_02]: country, they're cut, they're put in a
refrigerator, and then they're shipped to
[SPEAKER_02]: the greenhouse and then they're planted at
once.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is something some cannabis growers
are starting to experiment with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's taking the cuttings, putting them in
the refrigerator, and then taking them out
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're ready to stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you go through each subsequent
flush, you'll need to maintain an equal
[SPEAKER_02]: number of leaves and branches between the
mother plants to keep them growing at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: To figure out how exactly this can be
applied to cannabis with all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars, that includes we'll take some
experimentation and crop registration and
[SPEAKER_02]: what the ideal number of leaves,
the growth speed, and how many cuttings
[SPEAKER_02]: can be produced in what time frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've done this a few times with
each cultivar, you can create an ideal
[SPEAKER_02]: crop structure, density, and develop a
schedule for cuttings specific to that
[SPEAKER_02]: variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maintenance of mother plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Between each harvest of cuttings,
the growers will then go through these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants almost daily to ensure that they're
growing informally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaves are removed gradually, so they're
not doing full strips of the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: because the leaves are not only solar
panels, they're batteries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hold water and they hold nutrients
and they help keep the plant in balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you start ripping off leaves
excessively or all at once, it can throw
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants out of balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants will uptake water faster or
slower than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something to be considered of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in chrysanthemums specifically,
they keep these mothers for about 26 weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: because they see a significant decrease in
cutting success rates after 26 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But considering the success with cannabis,
it might be even shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen growers find that after three
months of having a mother plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cutting success rate just takes a
nosedive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they're getting 90, 80% success,
they've got down to 60, 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't explain why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that mother's been stressed out,
it's been there too long, it's time to
[SPEAKER_02]: change it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to take the most uniform cuttings
possible with the least amount of labor,
[SPEAKER_02]: chrysanthemum growers use this special
tool here to help ensure all the cuttings
[SPEAKER_02]: are the same length.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plastic tool uses a flat surface with
a sharp edge that not only supports the
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting as it's being taken, but also
ensures all the cuttings are the exact
[SPEAKER_02]: same length with the uniform number of
leaf sets without the need of additional
[SPEAKER_02]: labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So only new growth head cuttings are
taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though with cannabis you can take
over growth cuttings and still have
[SPEAKER_02]: similar success rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some stem is left above the node to
protect it so you can grow another
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important to have a clear visual
scale for the size cutting you wish to
[SPEAKER_02]: make.
[SPEAKER_02]: The chrysanthemum growers use this visual
scale to group the cuttings together to
[SPEAKER_02]: maintain uniformity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stem diameter is used to group the
cuttings as thick, good, or thin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by having this visual and measurable
standard to group the cuttings together
[SPEAKER_02]: allows them to be placed in batches so
they often grow at the same rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to keeping the stem length
diameter consistent between the cuttings,
[SPEAKER_02]: they also have to ensure that the cuttings
have the same number of leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're lucky enough to have space in
your cloning room, you should create a
[SPEAKER_02]: tray spacing that does not require you to
cut off too many leaves and leaf tips,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a contributing factor to creating
differences in growth rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, there's been some university
studies in Canada that found that just
[SPEAKER_02]: taking the leaf tips reduces cutting
success rate anywhere from like 71 to 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, we take leaf tips off because
we're trying to cram a lot of plants in
[SPEAKER_02]: one space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we leave more leaf tips on and
technically more leaves and then find an
[SPEAKER_02]: ideal spacing, you'll probably get
healthier cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that same study done by the University
of Guelph found that cuttings with three
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves as opposed to two leaves had a 15%
higher quality in rooting, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have that space and the luxury
to spread out your cuttings and not do the
[SPEAKER_02]: typical 98, 72, or 50 plants per tray,
you'll find that putting 20 to 25 plants
[SPEAKER_02]: in a tray will give you a better quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that we have uniformity in moms and
some uniformity in cuttings, we now have
[SPEAKER_02]: to place them into substrate and have a
way to maintain the cuttings until the
[SPEAKER_02]: next stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, if you have the luxury of space,
you'll need to find a good density that
[SPEAKER_02]: allows you to grow these cuttings without
being overcrowded in the tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Substrate volume can be adjusted based on
how long you intend to keep the cuttings
[SPEAKER_02]: in the nursery tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can use a small, small amount of
substrate and grow a very small cutting
[SPEAKER_02]: and have to transplant it very fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you use a bigger volume,
so you're using a two inch propagation
[SPEAKER_02]: cube, you can probably accomplish a little
bigger cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have an irrigation system that
allows you to water it more frequently
[SPEAKER_02]: without over-saturating the root zone,
you can probably accomplish some of your
[SPEAKER_02]: veg in the cutting phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having a larger volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the timing and frequency used to
irrigate cuttings has a tremendous effect
[SPEAKER_02]: on how the plants develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So watering too early seems to be the
biggest problem for most cannabis growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockwell has a higher water holding
capacity than most other substrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you water too much, too frequently,
you'll have poor root development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea after the first, you stick
your cuttings in substrate, you let the
[SPEAKER_02]: growing media dry back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, you could use weights to
determine when to water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you go for that first
irrigation, you don't want to submerge the
[SPEAKER_02]: cube again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to push out all that air
space because it's going to slow down
[SPEAKER_02]: plant development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may just want to tap the bottoms of
the blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really just touch them just to give
some new nutrient and bring the water
[SPEAKER_02]: content back up a little bit, but not up
to full capacity because that will slow
[SPEAKER_02]: you down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then watering too soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just using your hand is not necessarily
the best measure, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: letting your laborers do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may want to actually record the
weights of the trays or the plugs and use
[SPEAKER_02]: that to determine when to water,
especially for hard rooting varieties that
[SPEAKER_02]: just seem to take forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that you have your substrate,
you have a system for irrigation that
[SPEAKER_02]: automates your propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have to wet up your substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So commercially, this is typically done
with wetting lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are conveyor belt systems with three
booms of water that slowly move the blocks
[SPEAKER_02]: across a system that wets up the blocks
automatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us don't have access to this
equipment, but depending on your scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: it may make sense to automate this
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other option is a wetting cart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So same concept except more manual.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have three wetting booms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm moving the cart slowly over the blocks
to allow the water to saturate the blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I throw too much water too fast on the
substrate, I could potentially just bypass
[SPEAKER_02]: the substrate in different parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water won't spread out and will just
go down and out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really have to work on applying
either water really slowly or fully
[SPEAKER_02]: submerge your blocks and plugs to get
initial saturation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you initially saturate your
substrate, you then have to check the
[SPEAKER_02]: weights.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only way you can determine if
I've wetted up correctly and consistently
[SPEAKER_02]: across the batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using weights as a measurement to
determine have I fully saturated my
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate and when to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weights of the plugs and trays and blocks
should be checked after initial saturation
[SPEAKER_02]: to ensure that they've been saturated
correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also helps you determine,
hey, is there something different with
[SPEAKER_02]: either the way I've wetted up or is the
substrate holding more or less water?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then am I going to have to irrigate
sooner or later?
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you're just assuming everything
is correct and you're mindlessly applying
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigations without any consideration to
what's going on in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you probably know, climate has a
significant effect on how cuttings
[SPEAKER_02]: develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Often I see low lights in cutting rooms,
so less than 70 micromoles, where in most
[SPEAKER_02]: other horticulture crops, 70 to 90
micromoles is what's used just to
[SPEAKER_02]: supplement natural sunlight in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this low light intensity for cuttings
potentially slows down plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It opens up the plants to diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And extreme humidity with low light
intensity can create, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: foiler diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have plants in a humidity dome
with low light intensities, potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: high heat from a heat mat or the heat from
the lights below it, you're creating an
[SPEAKER_02]: environment to create molds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see a lot of problems where people
who have big powdery mildew problems or
[SPEAKER_02]: other mildews and fungus, those typically
start a propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, when doing chrysanthemums,
this is a chrysanthemum greenhouse in
[SPEAKER_02]: Holland, they do about half a million cuts
per week.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they lay out the cuts, they lay out a
plastic tarp just over top of all the
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a big volume of air that makes
it consistent across the entire batch,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's also keeping the moisture
potentially away from the leaf tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you notice the cuttings that are at
the end develop differently than the
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings that are in the center.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to look at systems that allow
us to raise the humidity without creating
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture on the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a revisiting of density in the
cutting trays, but also trying to figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out ways to grow cuttings without domes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No commercial crop other than cannabis
uses domes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to get the best cuttings possible,
you should look at a system that maintains
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity between 70 and 90%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers should work to ensure that the
leaf temps, the plant temps themselves are
[SPEAKER_02]: not getting too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using an infrared thermometer going and
checking, hey, is my root zone temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: high?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the leaf temp high?
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when you're first placing those
cuttings into the propagation room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So managing transitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: From cuttings to grow out stages is a
critical time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where possible, you should work to
adjust the climate of the cuttings
[SPEAKER_02]: gradually over the course of several days
to match the environment you plan to
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Failure to match the climates can cause a
negative reaction that you will not notice
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately, causing shock to the plants
and slowing down development and reducing
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I go from my propagation room with
70 to 90 micromoles and a low temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: to my bedroom with 200 to 300 micromoles,
really high light intensity, high heat,
[SPEAKER_02]: no humidity, you can really mess up your
crop and not know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not know it until weeks later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really important to match those
things or get the cuttings used to that
[SPEAKER_02]: environment prior to even putting them in
the new substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the same thing is transitioning
from lighting types.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I go from fluorescent to HPS or LED,
I don't necessarily want to match the
[SPEAKER_02]: light intensities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably want to go lower on the HPS or
really any, just when you make that
[SPEAKER_02]: transition, you should probably make the
new environment temperature lower just to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep the plants a little more safe until
they're ready to take off and to be rooted
[SPEAKER_02]: into the new substrate and they can grow
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I talked about earlier, irrigation
strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Irrigation strategy is a critical tool in
how the plants develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each irrigation applied sends a vegetative
signal to the plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about how fast plants grow again in
aeroponic systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since the roots are grown in air,
the drybacks are faster, allowing for more
[SPEAKER_02]: frequent irrigation and drives growth and
speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the goal is to develop the root zone,
drybacks are an important part of this
[SPEAKER_02]: process, especially when rooting into a
new substrate volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is again where measurements by weight
and sensors come into play to help you
[SPEAKER_02]: determine when done to irrigate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the roots are leaving the block,
it's most likely because you're applying
[SPEAKER_02]: too much water, you're achieving too much
drain, or you have water built up in the
[SPEAKER_02]: table.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing in substrate,
you typically want to keep the roots in
[SPEAKER_02]: that substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're promoting root growth outside
the blocks, you're opening yourselves up
[SPEAKER_02]: to more disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I go to transplant, I have all
these exposed roots in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to put it into something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to damage these roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And potentially open it up to a virus or a
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an irrigation system is really the only
way to get consistent and uniform
[SPEAKER_02]: resaturation and irrigation, even for
cuttings and veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Irrigation systems like flood tables,
NFT systems that use shallow trays with a
[SPEAKER_02]: small water stream growing process not
only allows you to automate the irrigation
[SPEAKER_02]: process, but will help you maintain the
uniformity you've worked so hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: create.
[SPEAKER_02]: So inconsistencies created by hand-dipping
trays, hand-watering, will carry
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the entire lifecycle of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flood heights and dip times can be
adjusted to apply just the amount of water
[SPEAKER_02]: to steer the plants as you see fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand-watering is possible during the
growing phase, but it creates a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: inconsistencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when selecting an irrigation system for
veg or for cuttings, it's important to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a system that allows you to
manipulate flood height.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I may want to flood high that first
irrigation when I'm saturating substrate,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe the second one, but later ones I may
just want to apply very small,
[SPEAKER_02]: just touch the bottom of the blocks or the
pot so I'm not completely pushing out all
[SPEAKER_02]: the air from the growing media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's an example graph of initial
dryback from a growed-in small block for
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the dryback happens slowly over the
course of four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going from a water content of
roughly 80%, initial saturation down to
[SPEAKER_02]: 30%, and then I'm giving it another big
feed and then I'm going down again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this strategy creates roots,
you know, forces those feeder roots to
[SPEAKER_02]: come out and search and root into the new
substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after I've done that, then I can start
using irrigation as a tool to steer
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you've rooted into the new
substrate, then you can apply the
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for generous steering, you'll want to
apply larger volumes of irrigation with
[SPEAKER_02]: less frequency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in an ebb and flow system, this can
consist of flooding higher up the side of
[SPEAKER_02]: the block less frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: In drip, this can be accomplished by
applying irrigation volumes of 6% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: total substrate size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say I have one liter of growing media,
I would give it a 6% shot, which would be
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 mils.
[SPEAKER_02]: The timing of these irrigations will
dictate the dryback.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you wish to have to be more
generative, you can wait longer to apply
[SPEAKER_02]: the first irrigation of the day,
and you'll stop earlier in the day to
[SPEAKER_02]: several hours before the lights go off to
have an increased dryback overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: This should result in a smaller,
more compact plant with a better root
[SPEAKER_02]: system inside the block.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be more vegetative,
if you want the plants to grow faster,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you will want to apply a more
vegetative strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is accomplished using smaller
irrigations, each typically 3% or less
[SPEAKER_02]: than the volume of growing media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, a one liter block, I would be
applying a 30 mil shot or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: In flood systems, you'd apply irrigations
that just touch the bottoms of the block,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, half inch or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will still want to ensure drybacks in
between irrigations of at least 1% to 2%
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have a sensor, a water content
sensor that allows you to measure those,
[SPEAKER_02]: and drybacks overnight of 10% to 15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would mean you might end up
watering earlier in the day, all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the day, so the plants can
uptake water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually you need to wait for the
plants to start to drink before you
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do want to delay, you don't want
the lights to come on and immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: start applying water, because this will
slow down growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's called transpiration before
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you're able to see that the plants
are uptaking water, either just you know
[SPEAKER_02]: by looking at it, or you have a sensor,
then you can start applying those first
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigations.
[SPEAKER_02]: This type of irrigation strategy will
result in healthy, vigorous, fast growing
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, and yeah, just get you a faster
veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how does this work in practice?
[SPEAKER_02]: This chart shows how to apply vegetative
and generative irrigation strategy to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: and small blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while the maximum wet weight,
the peak water content stays the same,
[SPEAKER_02]: the dry weight is almost 100 grams less
for generative steering.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest time between irrigations is used
to steer the plants with long rest times
[SPEAKER_02]: between irrigations for more vegetative
growth, while shorter rest periods steer
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants more vegetative.
[SPEAKER_02]: ECs of the applied irrigation solutions
are adjusted and used to steer growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So higher ECs creating a more generative
steer, while lower ECs more vegetative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Climate is also used in conjunction with
irrigation to steer the crop, and is just
[SPEAKER_02]: important as a irrigation strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're almost there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, the structures of the plants
have a profound effect on uniform
[SPEAKER_02]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants with different numbers of leaves
and branches will uptake water at
[SPEAKER_02]: different rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get this complaint from growers all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I have some plants that are
really wet, some plants are really dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of that's the placement
within the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much light they're
getting, but a lot of it has to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: that crop structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they even between the batch?
[SPEAKER_02]: So having different number of leaves and
branches, it's uptake rate, excessive leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: removal and pinching can create uptake
inconsistencies in the days following
[SPEAKER_02]: their application.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you do go through and you do
remove leaves, you probably have to make
[SPEAKER_02]: an adjustment to your irrigation strategy
in the days following those leaf removals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you're either over water or
under water with the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's pictured here is provided by a seed
company selling high-wire cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, this chart here defines how
the plants should be deleted in relation
[SPEAKER_02]: to fruit and flower development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the fruit is removed, a leaf is
removed to keep the plants growing all at
[SPEAKER_02]: the same rate and in balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm talking about a 16-hectare
tomato cucumber farm, I want all those
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to grow at the same rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to organize my labor, I have to
plan for my harvest, so all my plants have
[SPEAKER_02]: to be exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my opinion, heavy de-leafing and
pinching of cannabis creates a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: inconsistencies in the way the plants
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying don't remove your leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying you should look at
different ways of removing them and maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping it more in balance, whereas
opposed to doing all those de-leafings in
[SPEAKER_02]: one day or two days, I'm doing it over the
course of several days.
[SPEAKER_02]: This keeps the plants healthy and
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also keeps your labor a little more
happy because by the end of the row,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're probably just on autopilot just
dripping leaves and it can cause damage to
[SPEAKER_02]: the crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So only through time and testing will we
one day be able to have proven strategies
[SPEAKER_02]: like the chart here for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very quickly, to demonstrate just how
significant the pinching process can be on
[SPEAKER_02]: plant development, I just will discuss
some pinching techniques for tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the single-headed tomato plant,
this is an un-topped plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very strong, it grows very fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not typically done because it
requires a lot of climate steering to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants from growing too tall too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think this may be a good structure
for cannabis plants is instead of pinching
[SPEAKER_02]: early, we pinch later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using pinching as a high control method
but what needs to happen is you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out the exact timing when to space
and veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of reasons we pinch in cannabis
is because again, we had limited space for
[SPEAKER_02]: our mothers, limited space for cuttings,
limited space for veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we weren't able to transplant and space
the veg plants on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had to pinch to create the side
branching.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have more space and I can say,
I'm gonna space my plants one week after
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant, then I could probably build
out the side and lower branchings better
[SPEAKER_02]: than taking off the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other one is the pinch plant on the
second leaf set.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the most common one for
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second leaf set of the plant is,
the head and the second leaf is pulled off
[SPEAKER_02]: about four to five days after
transplanting out of cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant type is ready to transplant
about 55 days after you've taken the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they use climate and irrigation to
control the height of this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually you are keeping the day and
night temps even.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're actually manipulating day and
night difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bigger difference between day and
night, the more stretch I get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I want a less stretchy plant,
I can keep the temperatures even.
[SPEAKER_02]: This also helps with humidity control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of dropping the temperatures
and then creating dew point, I can keep
[SPEAKER_02]: the temperature even, have a higher
humidity and nighttime temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: which really helps for climate control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, pinched on the first set
of true leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for primarily seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not necessarily recommend this for
cannabis, but it's an interesting crop to
[SPEAKER_02]: pinch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have two headed plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all growing at the exact same rate
and now I have a lot of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: The chart here sort of shows this when to
apply it to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should develop charts like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do I do my first pinch?
[SPEAKER_02]: When do I space the plants and veg?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what kind of climate and
irrigation strategies do I need to use to
[SPEAKER_02]: control the plant height and keep plants
even?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in closing, uniformity starts with
mother's cuttings and in the veg phase,
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent initial saturation,
irrigation, climate help maintain that
[SPEAKER_02]: uniformity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Planting densities for mother's cuttings
and the later growth stages need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: optimized to build the most uniform crop
structures possible with the least amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of labor and energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Climate and irrigation steering should be
applied and used at every stage of growth
[SPEAKER_02]: from mother's cuttings, veg, and
throughout the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, pruning has a powerful effect
on how the plants develop and is a primary
[SPEAKER_02]: tool for maintaining uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got about five minutes for a
couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a question, put your hand
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm getting to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one for you there, Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying that the study said that
having more leaves when you do your
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting is going to actually end up being
beneficial for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a high end of that where the
plant that we're pulling is too big and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to put too much pressure on the
root formation?
[SPEAKER_02]: They only tested three and four leaf sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did not test bigger plants,
but that's something interesting,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I hope to look at that this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have taken longer cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure people here have taken longer
cuttings as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's something to explore.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the ideal cannabis cutting length?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone's really defined
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have everybody doing different things
until people have the scientific data,
[SPEAKER_02]: have done the trials themselves,
and it probably will vary by the variety
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many studies have been done on the
diameter of the cutting?
[SPEAKER_02]: On stem diameter?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's been done yet on the stem
diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it would make a difference,
obviously, or where it comes from the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did study where it came from the
plant, whether top cuttings or bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings were better, and they found that
there was really no difference between the
[SPEAKER_02]: top and the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were able to go to the prior
picture with the tomato, I've seen a
[SPEAKER_00]: technique done with tomatoes, and I wasn't
sure if you could do it with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant gets a little bit bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: those bottom leaves are removed,
and then those are planted down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium to create more fruiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think cannabis could?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can't do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is, for me, this really would
make weaker cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it makes weaker tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, these plants are more weak,
and this is not the one that's used
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen it done on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's either un-topped or a
late-topped plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because most people are using topping as a
method for creating side branches,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also for height control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if I let the plant grow un-topped,
it's going to be a massive plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a question, do I top in veg,
or do I top mid-first week flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: second week flower, or do I top at a
height?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's something that needs to
be explored.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long can you use mothers for before
you have to flow them to flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people have been keeping mothers
for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems like after three to four
months, the success rates of the cuttings
[SPEAKER_02]: declines rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we really don't know what
diseases and viruses affect cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because it's such a resilient plant,
it's resistant to so much that you
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't know that there's something wrong
with it, outwardly, by looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we do have one more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mentioned not using domes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you just use different rooms with
different lighting and humidity to address
[SPEAKER_03]: them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Humidity is intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, it depends on what your grow
room setup is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard because we've all designed our
rooms around domes and trays.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the chrysanthemum farms, they have a
tray that hasn't built in kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: structure that would support a tarp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do I make a mini hoop over top of,
because you can't put it over top of your
[SPEAKER_02]: rack because now you're capturing all that
heat and you're going to melt your
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to figure out a way to
insulate the trays from possibly the
[SPEAKER_02]: lights below and then maybe just a mini
hoop, a mini plastic hoop over top just to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep the moisture away from the leaf tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When is it too late to take our tops
anymore because we've moved too far into
[SPEAKER_01]: the flowering process and the hormones are
starting to gather at the top to form
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we actually take the cutting at
that point, we will actually be impeding
[SPEAKER_01]: future flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we talking about taking cuttings or
when to top?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if someone's trying to do this for
height control, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it depends on the variety
because some varieties will stretch a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that it's a variety dependent
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's why crop registration is
important because I don't think there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've so far seem to be applying the same
strategy to all cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're all different.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all significantly different in
terms of height development and stretching
[SPEAKER_02]: and how they, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's specific to variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put our hands together for Doug
Jacobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
