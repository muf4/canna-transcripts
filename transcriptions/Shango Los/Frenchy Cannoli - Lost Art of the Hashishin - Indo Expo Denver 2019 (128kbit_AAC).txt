[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you all know I'm pretty anal about
the definition of word and how important
[SPEAKER_01]: it is for us to be able to speak the same
language so that with legalization when
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody orders something from another
state or another city you can at least
[SPEAKER_01]: understand each other like they do in the
coffee industry in any other industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world where there is some
classification that has to be done and
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a lot about taste and flavor
there is classification that has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: done so that we understand each other and
on the concentrate part there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: misunderstanding between sieved raisin
head and extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all come under the definition of
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is a concentrate for a start?
[SPEAKER_01]: A concentrate, everything that we call
concentrate comes from those little raisin
[SPEAKER_01]: heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that you collect from those
little raisin heads is a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: From ash, sieved raisin, to pure isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: All, everything in between, all that is
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you have ever wondered
about the origin of concentrate and to be
[SPEAKER_01]: honest if you are able to get to the
origin of concentrate you need to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand the origin of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing with a cannabis plant it
has been going through migration with
[SPEAKER_01]: humanity for so long that we cannot
actually pinpoint its birthplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to think that there is three
potential birthplaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: China, because the oldest archaeological
evidence comes from China and it's a fiber
[SPEAKER_01]: in pottery.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second potential place is the feet of
the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the oldest written record in human
history come from India and in those
[SPEAKER_01]: records 5,000 years ago they were saying
that cannabis was born in the Himalayan
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain in a drop of the elixir of life
that fall from the sky when the gods were
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting to create the elixir of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have Central Asia and Central
Asia it's most certainly within years the
[SPEAKER_01]: most logical place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Central Asia it's because you can spread
the culture widely on the whole continent
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's the same latitude, it's basically
the same climate all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We come from Africa and we moved from
Africa 7 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant was born somewhere in Central
Asia, India, China humanity was from
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany to Papua New Guinea.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is evidence of humanity to almost 2
million years ago, 1.8 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how long it would take
humanity to pick up a cannabis plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: gives not only food but medicine and
fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long would it take these people to
pick up a plant that during that time
[SPEAKER_01]: since it was a megaflora and a megafauna
everything was 3 to 5 times bigger than
[SPEAKER_01]: what we know today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how long it would take our
ancestors to pick up on that plant but the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact is the first thing that can happen
when you get close to that plant and you
[SPEAKER_01]: touch it you hand roll resin and you make
the first concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first person that touch a cannabis
plant to pick up the seeds or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: they wanted they got resin on their hand
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humanity to create agriculture went
through 200,000 plants just the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: make seeds and food.
[SPEAKER_01]: From those 200,000 plants there is a
thousand or so that are edible a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: or so that can be domesticated and a dozen
that are still feeding the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 13,000 BC we have not domesticated a
new plant or a new animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those people had a relation with the plant
kingdom and an understanding of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the chance for those people to test the
resin that he collected on his hand to
[SPEAKER_01]: discover the property of that new plant is
very very very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until recently I always thought that the
plant is created by nature to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid but I saw that THC synthase
was one of the first synthase that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant was psychoactive at the time where
our first ancestors touched that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems that the CBD synthase is older
than the THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that that plant was medicinal
before emissive and because humanity
[SPEAKER_01]: touched it that plant created a
psychoactive compound to lock us down and
[SPEAKER_01]: protect her and make her grow in
everywhere she's growing now from South
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is easy to imagine people getting
connected when you touch the resin live
[SPEAKER_01]: resin is charas but it's a little bit more
difficult to start to understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: people went into the dry sieving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the culture of ash was born
somewhere and was eaten from everyone for
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands and thousands and thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is nothing about ashish until the
ninth century in a Muslim empire where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's in medicinal treaties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is thousands and thousands of
years where there is a knowledge of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of written record about the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is nothing about the resin until
ninth, tenth century.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to be able to protect something like
that and it's not known from anywhere it
[SPEAKER_01]: has to add value somehow back in time to
be unknown from other culture when in
[SPEAKER_01]: China the plant was breeded to create hemp
and fiber and seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you breed a plant on one direction
there is a knowledge that you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: away from the other so there is a good
chance that people are breeding from the
[SPEAKER_01]: other aspect of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The oldest ash culture is where two
potential birthplace of cannabis touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that whole region of the Hindu Kush,
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That place is in the middle of the Silk
Road.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Silk Road starts from China,
goes through India, Persia and finishes in
[SPEAKER_01]: Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that this is the oldest trade
road ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that is created on one side is
funneled through Afghanistan and there is
[SPEAKER_01]: only one corridor that lets the road pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that they had access to
everything that was exchanged from one
[SPEAKER_01]: side of the continent to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of it Pakistan is the birthplace of
cotton 7,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: China is the birthplace of silk 6,000
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a place where they had the potential
to find the tool to be able to get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: second dimension of concentrate,
dry seeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do dry seeding you need a certain
amount of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charas is land rice, wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not need any tool or any means to
collect plants in order to dry them and to
[SPEAKER_01]: collect the resin in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just use your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: In India and the feet of the Himalayas
it's mandatory because there is too much
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot actually dry seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charas is the first live resin ever made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people think that live resin
is being shown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live resin is any resin that you collect
on a plant when it's live.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you freeze it you can keep those
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: May it be CO2, may it be butane or any
sort of extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: A live plant goes from collecting it in
your hand live in a field to the latest
[SPEAKER_01]: and greatest extraction of all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want people to really understand that
BHO didn't invent live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live resin is the beginning of every
concentrate that you know of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charas has a certain texture that is very
special and very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a live resin you hold most
of the terpen.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make charas you lock down a lot
of those tears in your resin in your hand
[SPEAKER_01]: and when it ages it transforms to a new
level of taste but you still can recognize
[SPEAKER_01]: the flavor of the first day when you
collected it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you collect it the first day it's
kind of a little sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not yet really ready to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs time to settle down to be able to
lose that sharpness that you have or
[SPEAKER_01]: something fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much like drinking a Beaujolais
and drinking a wine that is not made to be
[SPEAKER_01]: drunk the first week that it's produced
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then agriculture was born.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have the potential to have that
many plants you are able to use technology
[SPEAKER_01]: to separate those resin heads from the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our ancestors came to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see the logic of it okay they touch
the plant the first time it's sticky but
[SPEAKER_01]: if they want to collect the seeds from
those plants they have to bring them to
[SPEAKER_01]: camp and dry them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those people had been dry sieving all
sorts of plant material to separate shafts
[SPEAKER_01]: and seeds so they're not going to harvest
the plant when it's live.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you dry it and break the bud you
still got resin sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy must have seen all that white
powder falling down and connect the two I
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine because not so long ago here in
California we didn't really know the value
[SPEAKER_01]: of resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty new for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine that first person tens of
thousands years ago understanding that the
[SPEAKER_01]: power of the plant is inside the resin
head that they cannot even see.
[SPEAKER_01]: That relation with the plant must have
been really really special because to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to figure that out we needed science.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you harvest the plant and you look to
get the seeds and it must have been part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the need of the people when they
started to cultivate the plant you start
[SPEAKER_01]: to dry and to cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to create a tool that will give
you the ability to separate contaminants
[SPEAKER_01]: from resin head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Braiding fiber is one of the oldest
[SPEAKER_01]: human manufacturing that we have ever
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiber can go back so far in time as far as
28,000 years ago there is the oldest
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence of a fiber that was relatively
beautiful because they compare it to a
[SPEAKER_01]: modern linen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that the perforation of that
fiber must have been pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The potential of humanity to have been
making Ashish on a regular basis can be
[SPEAKER_01]: traced basically to the birth of
agriculture because cannabis is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 plants that were first cultivated by
humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the second concentrate ever taken
from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a resin head that has been dried and
cured so that the terpene transforms and
[SPEAKER_01]: you become another terpene profile and
they create a mass of resin that holds in
[SPEAKER_01]: its body the matrix that created that
resin and it's something that can stone
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in a concentrate category when you
come out of the sieving methodology and
[SPEAKER_01]: ice water is not an extraction is actually
a sieving methodology and water is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually the only evolution in cannabis
resin sieving since cannabis resin sieving
[SPEAKER_01]: has been sieved for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: An extraction is when you take the resin
from the resin head.
[SPEAKER_01]: An extraction is when you take the juice
from a fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you shake a plant maybe with a
mechanical force to make a resin head fall
[SPEAKER_01]: and you collect that resin head wall you
do not extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sieving because you're separating
contaminants and resin head through a tool
[SPEAKER_01]: made of perforation and you agitate
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have seen it only with a machine and a
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally dry sieving it's two processes
that you cannot separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You agitate to break the resin head away
from the stock and you separate at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time when they fall on your tool and
go through those perforations per size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly what you do with water except
that water gives you the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: separate those two processes so that you
can really perfect them but it's just an
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still sieving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get into taking the resin head
from the resin from the tricon head to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to talk about extraction and the most
simple extraction, not solvent,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's using heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really thought for the longest time that
there was no real science behind resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really believe that just pressing and
timing it wasn't really a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learn better now because through
mechanical extraction you can literally
[SPEAKER_01]: create THTA.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can create THTA you most certainly
can do CBDA if you work with high CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: strength and you can create a source and a
pure crystal of THTA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as simple as I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of dimension in the
non-solvent extraction and then you have
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that uses a product that will
dissolve the resin head to be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: access to the resin inside is a solvent
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Butane, propane, ethanol, alcohol,
cryogenic, all that is solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only there are many different types of
extraction but there are many different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of products as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: As much as when you take the resin from
the tricon head you're stepping out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: entourage effect of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're stepping into new territory,
especially if you start separating
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to understand that cannabinoids
are made of two compounds, phenol and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenol is a toxic compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenol in certain quantities can make you
very sick and terpenes is so toxic that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can kill people with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is only one plant that not only can
transform this into cannabinoids but make
[SPEAKER_01]: it non-toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go into playing a game and
separating you have to be really aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: the potency and the power of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aromatherapy is one of the oldest
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make people do amazing things just
by pouring smell into a closed room and
[SPEAKER_01]: ingesting terpenes in high quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you better know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The final level of extraction,
not only when you extract you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to create an amazing number of
incredible products but the end game is
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isolate is something that the big pharma
have been trying to do chemically for over
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that they told us we
couldn't do to get themselves an excuse to
[SPEAKER_01]: spend, I don't know, a mini-billion of
dollars to try to create synthetically
[SPEAKER_01]: what that plant is giving us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that any kid with a good IQ and
$40,000 can make something 90.9% pure and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's western medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that level when you reintroduce
terpenes in certain quantities terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: not only are half of what a cannabinoid is
but it's what brings it into your cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what gives you the ability to absorb
it and it changes the experience that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can have depending on the amount of
terpenes and the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that you could create literally
a pharmacope where every cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_01]: every terpene the plant can produce would
be available and people would be treated
[SPEAKER_01]: by symptom and dose like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that the western medicine
can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is when you use the plant,
the terpene profile of the plant whilst
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpenes are similar to every other
terpene available in the plant kingdom,
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpene profile of the plant is
unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made of hundreds of terpenes and a
lot of them are such a minute quantity
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't know how much of it there
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's impossible to actually mimic the
plant and that means that the plant gives
[SPEAKER_01]: you literally two medicines, western and
herbal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I understand that the plant is
very complicated at every level and that
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to simplify a lot for everybody to
be able to understand the basic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is simplification and there is
misinformation so that I cannot accept
[SPEAKER_01]: that sieved resin is considered an extract
because it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ashish even more so because in the
booze industry with what fruit gives,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a lot of different booze and
there is wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: From wine, from grape, you can take the
juice and distill pure alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to make wine, you need the matrix that
created the sugar to be able to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the sugar and the skin to be able
to have the fermentation so that nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: would call wine an alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wine is its own category.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unique because of the way it's made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ashish is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you don't press your ash,
it's not the same product than when you
[SPEAKER_01]: have pressed your resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you press resin and you have
all those elements, that matrix that
[SPEAKER_01]: created the resin into a mass of resin and
terpenes that is corrosive, there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical reaction that happens and there
is a transformation that happens naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: like it happens in wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a mass of resin that can age and
gain in quality in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that is so unique in what
the plant is giving us that there is no
[SPEAKER_01]: right for anybody to use that word ever,
especially when you can trace it 1200
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago to Ashishia, eater of Ashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, centuries later, we have so many
products that come into so many
[SPEAKER_01]: categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of it, we have fresh,
frozen and dry materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important for us to understand
the products that we are putting on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You call everything ash, but if you could
tell a French man or an Indian or anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: on the planet where it's an ash culture
that you're an ash maker and you're an
[SPEAKER_01]: extractor, you're not going to understand
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to give you a good idea, when you
travel in Europe, we have the bad tendency
[SPEAKER_01]: to call resin and pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a conversation with a breeder that
made it really difficult to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: which pollen we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a world trade that is coming
soon to us, or at least an interstate
[SPEAKER_01]: trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can I order something to you if I
want ash, but you don't have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: definition of the word for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I order anything from you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not going even into the test I
want from the product I'm ordering from
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I created that
[SPEAKER_01]: so that by cutting it down into
methodology, it is easier to put
[SPEAKER_01]: everything into category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you can digest this, then there
is all the different products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: made in all those categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'm getting close to the end,
so if you have questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, are you done with your presentation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we'll have people come up over
here if you want to ask Frenchy questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does nobody not have questions for
Frenchy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, come over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have somebody up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my question is, you mentioned
different varietals in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: or different cannabis can call different
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with wine, there's different varietals
and vintners and vintages.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you perceive cannabis being the same
way as far as Appalachians, where
[SPEAKER_05]: something purely Malbec is from a certain
region?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work mainly with some grown beer farmers
and small farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I'm in North Cal, we are
trying to create Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's like Appalachian,
it's a big game that is defined by
[SPEAKER_01]: hardcore regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wine industry didn't want to play
that game for good reason, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: needed the elbow space to really create
their own wine, but because it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the cannabis industry,
they want to use the word Appalachian d
[SPEAKER_01]: 'origine, but the word Appalachian d
'origine, it's actually like champagne and
[SPEAKER_01]: cognac.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot use it if you don't do the deed
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, that's the ultimate reward that
you can give to a producing country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it applies only for sun-grown and
fully grown in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no pot, there is no greenhouse,
all that cannot be an Appalachian d
[SPEAKER_01]: 'origine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, you can create
quality designation for every category
[SPEAKER_01]: that would bring up the level of quality
and give recognition to the farmers that
[SPEAKER_01]: go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that can be used to define
standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Appalachian d'origine is the ultimate
standard that defines the ultimate quality
[SPEAKER_01]: that is recognized for a region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this can be applied to any type of
farming.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just curious, is this on your
website, this chart?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I download this on your website?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where can I get a copy of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on my IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be in the next skunk
magazine, and we'll put it on the website.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you were talking about the region,
it's the terroir, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically is what we're talking about
based on the environment and everything
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, you had mentioned that
cannabis had come from basically all the
[SPEAKER_03]: regions were kind of on the same latitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I remember reading somewhere that said
that the Emerald Triangle was on the same
[SPEAKER_03]: latitude as Afghanistan, like the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it has nothing to do with
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the Emerald Triangle is not
specifically a good place to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an amazingly rich region,
full of microclimate and an amazing soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of humidity in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow the biggest tree,
grow there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like the thing is cannabis has
adapted very, very, very well there
[SPEAKER_01]: through generation in certain family.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you cannot compare it on the latitude
scale with other producing country because
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghanistan is very, very dry,
very windy, quite the opposite of North
[SPEAKER_01]: Cal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just wondering some clarification on
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were saying how hashish,
we don't want to confuse each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were saying people who make BHO are
not hash makers as opposed to?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are resin extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can find any name they want,
but they don't do hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashish is the resin collected,
pressed with a source of it that become a
[SPEAKER_01]: mass of resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that doesn't keep the matrix
of the resin inside that mass of resin
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot be called hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you find the term butane hash oil to
be?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not butane hash oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's butane honey oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became butane hash oil because you use
the word hash because it's less scary to
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole world than extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have no right to that word because
it has nothing to do with your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like even if you have no respect for
tradition, it has nothing to do with what
[SPEAKER_01]: you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you will not call wine an
alcohol because it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wine is wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't call, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like hashish is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people in the booze industry,
when they started to distillate,
[SPEAKER_01]: they created their own product and their
own name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you're smoking weed,
can't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have more inspiration and find a word
that really define the product you're
[SPEAKER_01]: making.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem also is like because you
keep your technique and your product under
[SPEAKER_01]: secret condition, there is, you use names
that define the product but promote it in
[SPEAKER_01]: a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not something that is agreed upon
everybody on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: A shatter, I've seen people call shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: A shatter should shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: A shatter that is not shattery is not
shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even simple words like that are misused.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like we are legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world is looking at us and we don't
have a common vocabulary to define our
[SPEAKER_01]: main product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now then it's like when you're going to
order a hash from me but you want the
[SPEAKER_01]: taste of the chocolate from the Pinot
Noir.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you going to explain that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, hi, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a question in regards to Sativas
and the whole hash processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I have noticed that
unfortunately experimenting with some
[SPEAKER_00]: land-raised cultivars doesn't have as much
as oil content, as majority of the Sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids that we have available in the
commercial market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my concern is with your experience in
years of growing, how are you able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: or is there an effective way of,
maybe I can't use the word extracting
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collecting the turkeys and the canyons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant most certainly was born or in
Central Asia or at the feet of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feet of the Himalayas, this is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super humid, super rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no dust, there is no wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil is rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a huge insect life around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant grows lanky all over the place,
quite tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as there is a little space,
they branch like crazy and they produce a
[SPEAKER_01]: very sticky resin that you actually
collect on your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you step, next door it's the Pamir
mountain and the Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically kiss each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there you have no vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super windy and super dusty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is green only where there is water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because there is no green,
there is no insect life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant grows short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they grow short, they need to make
bigger leaves so that they can pump more
[SPEAKER_01]: sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, a resin super sticky
in a place super dusty, the resin is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get super dusty and then it cannot
function.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the UV function, all the main function
of the resin wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be at full potential anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because there is no insect,
the plant doesn't need to be sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the membrane of the resin head from
a pure Kush is much thicker than the
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane of a pure land race like Burman
or South America or Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys, you don't have Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa, it's minimum 15 weaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like you some smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: To smoke some and nobody, if you have
them, you're going to harvest at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have some UV hybrids that have a
tendency to go on each side.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you work with something that is more
on the Kush side, you don't need to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme to work in a very cold condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you work with anything that is,
if you have a very tropical influence,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to work in very, very cold
condition to be able to manipulate resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you use cold because resin is
sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to manipulate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you sieve and the resin is sticky,
when you break it away from the stock,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's stuck to the plant material,
you're not going to get it in your sieve
[SPEAKER_01]: material and through the perforation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you work in very cold condition when
you sieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you ice water, it's the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you extract, a lot of extraction
use cold also to be able to manipulate and
[SPEAKER_01]: at a deeper level the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I answer your question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want a quick touch on something
that I'm really a fan of with you,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is using cured resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe if you could just talk a little
bit about the benefits of cured resin and
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe if there's some type of chemical
changes that the trichome or the resin
[SPEAKER_04]: head itself goes through in that process
that makes the effect or even the
[SPEAKER_04]: end-to-finish product of the medicine
different from the flavor-driven,
[SPEAKER_04]: turpentine-driven liquefies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dried and cured resin, it's hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live resin, it's chalaz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's two different, totally different
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you cannot really compare it because
the buzz is different, the texture,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you dry a plant material,
you lose 80% of your tar in the
perforation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the 20% left, their isomer
bounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go through an isomerization process
that bounds their isomer and it gives you
[SPEAKER_01]: a different terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different from just dry and very different
than live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the best?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because you lose 80% of your tar
that that product is better than when you
[SPEAKER_01]: lose 80%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's all a question of taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aficionado has a genetic called Pinot
Noir.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's live, it's like a field of
flower with a lot of lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from South of France.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very, very sensitive to lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you cure it, it's like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smoke, you have chocolate in your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never smoked chocolate before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you ask me, in that case,
if I like cure better than live,
[SPEAKER_01]: hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a question of choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's two different peak of uniqueness and
quality that the plant is giving you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have one, you have two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is no comparison to be made
except in lab testing what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference and what it brings to the
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the psychoactive and the medicinal
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, as long as appreciation goes,
well, it's just greatness that the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is giving you.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as that, with the chemical change,
there is a chemical change, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's changing the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: What really change?
[SPEAKER_01]: You transform your chlorophyll into sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I rather smoke sugar than chlorophyll
all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as an ash maker, if you give me just
cut flower trim, it's going to bleed
[SPEAKER_01]: green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have a lot of chlorophyll in
my ash, and I have no way to separate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worse than doing live resin,
where I have a little green seeping from
[SPEAKER_01]: the cut I give to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chlorophyll is like in a vein system
in a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut it, it bleed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't bleed all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only when you freeze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need to work super fast before it
melt inside because otherwise you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a lot of chlorophyll in that case
because freezing creates ice which is 10%
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger than water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you literally explode from the inside
out your plant matter, which is really
[SPEAKER_01]: bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you work fast and good,
the cut is cauterized and you have no
[SPEAKER_01]: green coming down.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's just dry, that plant material,
you cannot do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried to freeze it before
working it, but if I freeze that material,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid to make the stock brittle and
that would be really bad as well because
[SPEAKER_01]: then I have something that is not a resin
head and the same size and the resin head
[SPEAKER_01]: in my bag, I have no way to separate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I think that is all for your
presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
