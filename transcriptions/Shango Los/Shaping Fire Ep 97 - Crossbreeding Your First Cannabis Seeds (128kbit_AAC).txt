[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a big fan of gatekeeping
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to learn a skill, people
shouldn't try to keep the education from
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gatekeeping happens a lot in cannabis
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was less common before when we were all
just criminals together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that there are some legal financial
opportunities in cannabis, some folks have
[SPEAKER_02]: decided that cannabis can now be a
win-lose sport instead of including
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not down with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have ever considered introducing a
male and female cannabis plant to each
[SPEAKER_02]: other to watch seeds be made and have your
own pile of seeds to phenohunt,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should absolutely do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeding is not hard at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it is so easy, it happens on
accident all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let people tell you it is too hard
or that you shouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that said, you don't become an elite
breeder without years of work,
[SPEAKER_02]: studying, and looking at thousands of
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that isn't what you wanted to do,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just wanted to make some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Save seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share seeds with friends and especially
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Open pollinate and preserve land races and
share those too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I firmly believe in cannabis patient
self-sufficiency and the plant wants you
[SPEAKER_02]: to make crosses, even bad ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this episode is for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just some breeding basics,
but it's really all you need to get going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after you enjoy it, there are plenty
of sources of advanced breeding best
[SPEAKER_02]: practices to refine your skills later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But get started now and have fun with it.

[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest today is Brandon Potter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brandon is co-founder of Michael Fight
Solutions, a group of regeneratively
[SPEAKER_02]: minded crop advisors, providing
professional services to cannabis and food
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is also on the cannabis breeding team
at New Breed Seed in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brandon earned a master's of science in
biology, concentrating on both fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: endophytes and fungal pathogens at
University of Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_02]: During today's episode, we are talking
about breeding your first cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: making your first cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode will be a great primer for
anyone considering making cannabis seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: for the first time and others who are just
simply curious about the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are especially curious about
breeding cannabis, be sure to check out
[SPEAKER_02]: episode 92 with Caleb Inspecta and Ryan
Lee Kamira about breeding S1 seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: then episode 71 with Daniel Morford on
pollen collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And episode 64 on female only breeding
with Ryan Lee Kamira.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the way back to episode 24 to
hear Mean Gene from Mendocino discuss
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis breeding on the episode entitled
The Keeper Plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: On today's episode though, set one will
focus on common motivations folks have to
[SPEAKER_02]: breed cannabis seeds, some of the clear
opportunities there are for seed makers
[SPEAKER_02]: and choosing whether to breed indoors or
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second set looks at choosing plants to
grow across, sifting for parents and
[SPEAKER_02]: ensuring pollination occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we wrap up the show in set three,
talking about the best time to harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: your seeds, curing and storing your new
beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Brandon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for taking the time to join me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have been trying to put
together this show for a while,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, it really takes a particular
kind of person to do like an introductory
[SPEAKER_02]: show on breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so many of the people in the
scene who I'm friends with, they may be
[SPEAKER_02]: advanced breeders, but they don't
necessarily have the bringing it down to
[SPEAKER_02]: the basics for new folks level or really
all that much teaching experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I got turned on to you just a
few weeks ago, I mean, you were kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: kind enough to send me auto flower seeds
that I grew this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I knew you just as a seed guy,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I had the opportunity to see your
interviews after the auto flower cup,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all like, oh wow, this guy really can
explain what he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I looked you up and I
found out like you had a masters and you
[SPEAKER_02]: had been a great graduate assistant and
you had been teaching, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh, you know, this is the
guy that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, we connected and you
were exactly the guy who I thought you
[SPEAKER_02]: were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I appreciate you bringing your
skills to us so that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are tuning into the show to get
like an easy, better understanding of how
[SPEAKER_02]: to start off growing your first or not
just growing, but breeding your first
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis variety that this will be a good
solution for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I really hope I can help some
people today, maybe avoid some pitfalls
[SPEAKER_00]: and wasted time that I definitely got into
when I first started making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is so time consuming, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a drag to put in all that time
and effort and like patience and then get
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way to the end and find out that
like something you just screwed something
[SPEAKER_02]: up or something wasn't right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then having to start over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I've only bred one time
myself, and it was for a very particular
[SPEAKER_02]: reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was what, like six, seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the when the CBD stuff was first
starting to become more readily available
[SPEAKER_02]: and the seeds at the time, you know,
you'd buy, you know, CBD seeds in a pack
[SPEAKER_02]: and they didn't all breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't all grow with CBD in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it would be was more like there
are some CBD seeds in this pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so you couldn't just like, you know,
grow them all, find your females,
[SPEAKER_02]: clone them and then have a field of CBD
because not all of those female plants had
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and working with the patients here on
Vashon Island, I could I couldn't just
[SPEAKER_02]: give out seeds to people that that they
were going to have to grow and then get
[SPEAKER_02]: tested before they knew that it even had
CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not like setting them up for
success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my first project was to make CBD
seeds that were 18 to one, but that every
[SPEAKER_02]: single female was going to show that CBD
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so so, you know, I did that and gave
away a bunch and then much to my surprise,
[SPEAKER_02]: sold a bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your motivation for starting to
breed cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, before I just want to say I can
totally relate to that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2013, I was the first CBD seed I
could get was from Sohum seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Harle Harle Su.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the pack just said most
plants will be CBD dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really frustrating for me at the
time because I like CBD crew was releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: one to one seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew that one of their parents had to
be a CBD dominant true breeding line and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just weren't releasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate your work doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first seed that I ever made and I
wouldn't, you know, this wasn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just making seed to have more seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the first strain I ever grew,
which was Twilight from Dutch Passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just made seed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually never I never grew any of
the seed I made because I didn't like the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one one pitfall to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that's really funny to put in
all that effort and then go like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not happy with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the time it was like I
concurrently made the seed with the first
[SPEAKER_00]: grow of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't really waste any time for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was effort that, you know,
if I knew that I didn't agree with the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain so much, I wouldn't have done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's interesting because
like people grow for a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, of course, there's just fun,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's cannabis enthusiasts who just
fricking love the plant and they want to
[SPEAKER_02]: do and try everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's people who are like more
in it for the science, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like botany minded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all like, I must I must I must
know all plants intimately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there are some people who do it in
service to patients, which was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like where I was coming at it from is that
I needed this for patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's I think most people fall
into one of the last two categories,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is to get something that they
uniquely love or because they need to make
[SPEAKER_02]: some money.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and and I think that's, you know,
I think people generally fall into those
[SPEAKER_02]: categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you decided that you wanted to dive
in and, you know, really study it,
[SPEAKER_02]: take your take your, you know,
you know, botany and and soil and and
[SPEAKER_02]: biology backgrounds and really dive into
cannabis, you know, what were what did you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to create with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your goal?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I'm asking you,
I know that I know the show isn't like
[SPEAKER_02]: about you, but but what I'm hoping is,
is that the people who are listening to
[SPEAKER_02]: the show, who are thinking about getting
into this or are considering it,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe kind of giving them a little
encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I I sort of always had an interest in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that I would be in the
industry necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even I lived in the East Coast,
usually in not friendly states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was growing black market back in like
the early 2000s and all that while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going through formal school for biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I worked for the Forest Service
for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went back to grad school for
plant pathology, focused on fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that was kind of with back in
the, you know, in the back of my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this could be used for focusing on
like a natural resource career with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Forest Service or Park Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I could also do cannabis with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially nowadays, if you're young
and you have access to a lot of schools
[SPEAKER_00]: have cannabis specific programs now or
classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even schools in unfriendly states are
able to work with hemp and do really cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, genomic cutting edge technology
type stuff with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were just getting into it,
I might have focused more on that in my
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I always wanted to work with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always interested in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really take many formal breeding
classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really learned on the job since I've
worked with a cannabis breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I had a background in
genetics and biology, but practical plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding is a much different thing than I
had in my head at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's just much more directed than,
you know, I think evolutionarily a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And evolution still applies, of course,
to plant breeding and artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the numbers and how to achieve
something on a human time scale are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is opportunities, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, you and I both got into
breeding originally because we both saw
[SPEAKER_02]: the opportunity and the need to have a
pack of seeds that CBD was expressed in
[SPEAKER_02]: every one of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what, you know, originally
got you and I to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's so many opportunities right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: As somebody who's very involved with the
cannabis breeding scene, what are some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the opportunities like the niches that are
just dying to be filled right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple that I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the first things beyond just
making seeds for preserving and growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future, the first breeding programs
that I also started on my own were CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: programs where I was trying to get CBD
dominant plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was also eventually trying to
put CBD into auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the auto flower generally was a missing
niche that I saw maybe 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's being filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still a huge deficit in the
quality and variety of auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's still a really big open niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are moving into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of new growers that are just
growing auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some great auto flower
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, people have only been
working on auto flowers for the last 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years intensely, maybe 30, 40 years total
as far as smokable flower goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been working on photo periods
for thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot that can be moved into
auto flower to improve those still just as
[SPEAKER_00]: THC cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, smokable hemp is turning out to be a
smaller market than maybe I thought it was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot of potential in the
missing market there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how big of a market,
but there is a lack of good smokable auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's increasing amounts of good
smokable photo period hemp, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: still, you know, far below THC photo
periods that are elites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other big market that's going to be a
little harder for small scale growers to
[SPEAKER_00]: compete with is the minor cannabinoid
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially, you know, CBD, THC are
relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the inheritance patterns of them,
they kind of function as one co-dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: gene where you cross a THC dominant plant
to a CBD dominant plant, and they come out
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You inbreed that generation, and it's
going to segregate one to two to one,
[SPEAKER_00]: where one, 25% will be THC dominant,
50% will be intermediate, 25% will be CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a relatively easy test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or gene to breed with for a home breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have to get that tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bioassay it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not getting high off a
plant, it's probably a pure CBD plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But- What's that term you just used?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bioassay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that kind of like a cute phrase for
smoking it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not heard that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually heard that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reference to, I think it was Andrew
Weill and Gary Linkoff, who was the
[SPEAKER_00]: Audubon mushroom field guy author.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found some Gymnopolis spectabilis in
Central Park in New York, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: reported it as active following a
bioassay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning they just ate it and hoped that
everything went well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that term.
[SPEAKER_02]: I interrupted you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were explaining how some of the novel
cannabinoids are a target-rich
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, but that's not just for
everybody because of the analytics that
[SPEAKER_02]: are necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to be hard to compete
with some of the bigger players with- Like
[SPEAKER_02]: your neighbors at Oregon CBD seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a whole scientific setup there
now for intense analytical breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard for a normal Joe to compete with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially at numbers to create a plant
that is not just that cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is a worthy agronomic plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I see the major market lapses
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree with you on both of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was getting into breeding right now,
I would intentionally try to stay away
[SPEAKER_02]: from the kinds of stuff that the big
companies with deep pockets and scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: teams were working on because the long and
the short of it is that unless it's your
[SPEAKER_02]: passion, all those companies are going to
get that stuff done first.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to compete with folks
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas anybody can, for example,
I agree with you, the auto flowers are
[SPEAKER_02]: continuing to be more and more predominant
for home growers and patients and
[SPEAKER_02]: competing with light depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot of opportunities in
auto flowers and also for atypical
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, for example, like menthol,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, there's some plants that have got
menthol, but there's not a lot and there
[SPEAKER_02]: are a lot of other flavor terpene profiles
that are as fringe as menthol that people
[SPEAKER_02]: can find and just run with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is something that is more
about having a decent size sift and
[SPEAKER_02]: putting the time to smell and then
focusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get to that with backyard or
bedroom breeding a lot easier than you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be able to create a freaking THCV
dominant strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways, even though those are
inherited in complex multigenetic fashion,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like a terpene profile,
there is a limit to the scalability simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because some of these large firms can't
smell every plant and can't take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: every plant in a way that really gives you
a good idea of what the terpene profile or
[SPEAKER_00]: the aroma profile is going to be at the
end of the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they have all the genomic data and
they know exactly what base pairs are in
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant, we don't really have the
phenotype data of what genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with different terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an area where home growers are
still very competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like disease resistance can
also, even though it's very complex and
[SPEAKER_00]: for known genes, the big players are going
to have an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a plant that you observe to be
resistant, that's something you can
[SPEAKER_00]: observe at home even if it's a complex
trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really interesting point.
[SPEAKER_02]: These companies that are doing huge,
huge, huge grows of thousands of plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are totally not going to have the
staff and the labor to be able to go and
[SPEAKER_02]: sniff all the plants to find out what they
have that special.
[SPEAKER_02]: That really does create a stronger
position for the home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another opportunity that I think there is
is for short flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean short flowering photos that are
under like let's say 52 days because as we
[SPEAKER_02]: know, when those of us who are not in
California, we buy these seeds and we get
[SPEAKER_02]: California seeds and if you're going to
grow them indoors, that's one thing
[SPEAKER_02]: because you can pretend California in your
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're going to grow outdoors,
California seeds don't just thrive or they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't thrive just anywhere because most of
us have got other kinds of weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm an extreme example here on
Vashon Island where our plants start
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering around August 15th, so an
eight-weeker is going to be like October
[SPEAKER_02]: 15th.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm two and a half to three weeks into my
rain season at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no chance I'm going to finish
anything from California in Western
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look for very short things like the
there's a bunch of under 55-day stuff from
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt Seed Company where they may just
barely be that where I live versus
[SPEAKER_02]: California, but there's no doubt that
they're short and that's a great
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if somebody could get a reliable,
great terpene profile 45-dayer,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'd be a huge breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasingly, I'm seeing people selling
what they call fast photos, which are a
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period crossed with an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll function as photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg them, you can take clones,
but that auto either speeds up its
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time and or it triggers earlier
from diminished light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a longer critical night period
than a pure photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually haven't come across those yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to come across that myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea to have a fast flower that I can
clone is very attractive to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that Humboldt Seed Company
has some like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to start using that
keyword.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've kind of established like a whole
bunch of different reasons that people
[SPEAKER_02]: breed and what some of the opportunities
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a bit about space and materials
because there's a lot of different ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: do this and anybody who tells you that
there's only one way to breed,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just kind of full of themselves
because there's lots of way to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you go ahead and just kind of like
describe and compare what your thoughts
[SPEAKER_02]: are about breeding indoors versus breeding
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to depend on what your final
goals are to some extent and what your
[SPEAKER_00]: situation is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do either if you're goal is to
produce a plant that's being grown
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, then there are benefits to
growing outdoors and you can also grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors and indoors where you're breeding
a cycle outdoors and then breeding indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: over the winter or some combination like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, indoors is more accessible to
more people, but again, it depends on what
[SPEAKER_00]: your final goals are and there's different
ways you can tweak your breeding scheme
[SPEAKER_00]: and methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: To buffer against some of the negatives
for either situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, both can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that there's an inherent
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what your end goals
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: To what degree do you think it's important
to breed in the same environment where the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds are going to be grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fairly significant,
especially for outdoor varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give an example where we have worked
with some auto flowers that are bred in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon where they're grown outdoors in the
summer usually during the dry period,
[SPEAKER_00]: so like July to late August.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather during that period is usually
80s to 100 during the day lately and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it still drops to 40 to 60 at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get this cool night period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those same autos when they were
grown in the Midwest ended up really short
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of the things we kind of theorize
is that they're responding to basically
[SPEAKER_00]: heat units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because it's still hot in the night in
the Midwest, their metabolism is sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: still running and they're aging in a way,
but they're not actively elongating and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in the same way that they do in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely environmental
effects that can have unforeseen or
[SPEAKER_00]: significant consequences on how the plant
reacts depending on where you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, for indoor breeders,
the differences are going to be minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there still will be some between and
among different indoor grow setups,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's going to be a much more
significant effect when you take an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an interesting idea about the hot
nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you may have just solved something
that happened to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earlier this summer, I was running a
specialty auto flower indoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I normally just run them outdoors,
but I was doing it indoors and it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: a really squat plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't stunt, but it stopped at about
18 inches and it was heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was heavy for 18 inches,
but I didn't understand why it didn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: the height that I was expecting and other
people did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hot in the spring here and my
nights were hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you that those additional heat units
kept them surprisingly small because it
[SPEAKER_02]: was so hot in the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never heard of that analysis before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something, not necessarily how
I described it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a technique called temperature
diff in greenhouses where they affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: height of greenhouse plants by raising the
temperature in the morning for a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time and plants will react
physiologically to things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be either or both of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, I've seen a plant, an auto
flower that was bred outdoors in Oregon or
[SPEAKER_00]: in greenhouses, and it was grown indoors
under 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up about a foot tall,
like six branches, and each branch had
[SPEAKER_00]: about a two-liter nug on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to the soil, it does not look like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, it's a four or five-foot plant
with normal size buds and structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely are reacting differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the advantages in space
between indoor and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor is, of course, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of great reasons for it,
for privacy and control of your
[SPEAKER_02]: environment and maybe your breeding for
indoor plants because that's what you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to provide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to provide to people,
but also outdoor is great because if you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't live in the city, you may well have
unlimited space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do a more significant run to
produce more seeds at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking to Dan Jimmy at Gnome
Automatics.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he wants to bring something to
market, he's looking to produce 30,000
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, holy crap, that's a lot of moms
and a lot of processing those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on what your particular needs
are as the breeders, that's really going
[SPEAKER_02]: to influence whether or not you choose to
grow indoor or outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just one variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably eight or 10 or 12 variables
that you have to decide which is right for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these questions, we have to start
with where your goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just breeding for yourself,
for home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to produce commercial
quantities, things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That will change how you approach the
project to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot more people are breaking up indoor
space into subspaces by using grow tents
[SPEAKER_02]: versus just using an entire room,
like a grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might take their garage and put four
or six tents in there and treat them as
[SPEAKER_02]: individual spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a pretty novel approach to
turn one room into six rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing this for breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're doing this for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's valid as long as you meet a
certain pollen control threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially cannabis pollen, it's wind
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves around really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people doing this where they're
filtering usually through a MERV filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think anything rated above a nine will
work for pollen, but probably an 11 to 13
[SPEAKER_00]: is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll have them under positive
pressure blowing in clean filtered air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is if you have a bunch right
next to each other, you also want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: filtering the outlet air with the same
filter or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with grow tents, they're usually sewn
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any holes in that tent,
pollen will be escaping out of those
[SPEAKER_00]: holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tape them up or I've seen
heat-sealed tents where there aren't any
[SPEAKER_00]: holes in the seals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anytime you open that tent as well,
you're going to be exposing the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tents to pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways to manage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can build tents where there's
irrigation into the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the pollen starts to drop,
you close the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never open it until it's harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way to prevent pollen
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for producing pretty much
commercial quantity seed lots though,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're devoting a whole tent to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just breeding you can do pollen
bags or an individual branch pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: probably with just as much control over
pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not opening the tents,
that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a situation where they're
completely sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the ideal situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have grow tents and there's
these pinholes all over the seams and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, that might still work
broadly, but you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of pollen contamination
from one to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're opening and going
tent to tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can minimize that with spraying water
and things like that, but cannabis pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: is very moveable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for most folks, they're probably
going to start with their one tent and
[SPEAKER_02]: their one project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then after they have success and they give
some seeds away to patients and they sell
[SPEAKER_02]: some to friends or online or something,
and they were like, oh hell, I think I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do this some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, so maybe now you get a couple
more tents, but you're going to spend some
[SPEAKER_02]: of that money you made to get some really
nice tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a bunch of really mediocre to
crappy tents, and then Gorilla sent me a
[SPEAKER_02]: tent and I'm like, oh crap, this is a
whole different level than the other tents
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been using.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was doing this, I'm certainly not
pushing, saying that people need to use
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorilla tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that there are different
grades of tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: As somebody decides to take this more
seriously, if they choose to, they will
[SPEAKER_02]: probably upgrade their gear to be on par
with their level of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I would say that's valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're producing a tent full of seed
though, that's a lot of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, 30,000 seeds for a
commercial lot from Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do that in a 10 by 10 area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to producing seed outdoors,
but probably a thousand, maybe 1500 Watts
[SPEAKER_00]: could easily produce that much seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you've gotten to the point that
there's one, well, I'm pretty sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: one tent can grow to be five tents pretty
fast when somebody's got the bug.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that most of the time that you
are breeding, it's outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about doing that
responsibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what process you use,
but the main thing I want to hit on is
[SPEAKER_02]: folks that just let their pollen go into
the air wild, especially if they are in
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been very challenging here on Vashon
Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did an education campaign here and
we're not running into it as much as we
[SPEAKER_02]: did say in like 2015, but in 2013,
14, 15 times, we had people that were just
[SPEAKER_02]: putting a male plant with some female
plants in their yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our whole island is only like 14 miles
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: With enough people letting pollen go on
the island, all sorts of cross
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patient gardens got ruined by being seeded
because they didn't know that their
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbor at the end of the block was
letting pollen just like raw dogging it
[SPEAKER_02]: out into the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely discourage people from just
letting males go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're doing this at a professional
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how you guys do it with the pollen
or I imagine that you have more pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: control even outdoors where you're
applying it in a more controlled way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know though and so I'll leave that
up to you to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are pollen isolation distances for
commercial seed production if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do an outdoor production of seed,
which I'm talking like many, many acres of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, all the breeding that we do and
what I would do outdoors is the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: bagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we do all female breeding and so
we're partially reversing plants to self
[SPEAKER_00]: them and those plants are bagged before
any pollen is dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never release pollen openly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just onto themselves inside the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, if we're doing say a
production, we will have it in a pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: isolation like I described earlier with a
filtered inlet and outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once they start producing pollen,
they don't get opened again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not just releasing pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing something like a backyard
and this is another thing, you really need
[SPEAKER_00]: to know what your goals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is someone leaving a male out there
just continuously pollinating his female
[SPEAKER_00]: or their female?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many seeds are they trying to produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need much pollen to produce a
lot of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do a select pollination
in your backyard, I would have that male
[SPEAKER_00]: in a closet or you can do it in a little
greenhouse, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, when I have a single male at
home like this and it's not bagged,
[SPEAKER_00]: I remove any forming male flowers before
they drop pollen until the female is ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to receive pollen and then I'll let the
males develop, collect that pollen or pair
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the closet, bring the female
inside, let them have sex with each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I kill the male immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing something like that or a more
controlled pollination, if you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a big lot of seed, then if you can,
try to bring the females to the male in an
[SPEAKER_00]: enclosed space and you can let them hang
out for a couple of days even in the dark
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get pollinated and then kill the
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could do it a couple of times,
bring them in at night and just shake that
[SPEAKER_00]: male all over them, take them out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could keep the male for a couple of
weeks, do that, and then kill the male
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the moral of the story is there's
no way in one show that we are going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to cover all variables everyone might
consider for making their first cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're trying to get across is that
there are a lot of ways to do this and
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure you do your homework and try not
to be irresponsible with your pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's generally the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just letting your male out there
pollinate everything, you're limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself to one pollination project a year
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true because your entire
property is going to be covered with that
[SPEAKER_02]: one pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least 12, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's go ahead and take our first
short break.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we come back, we're going to talk a
little bit about this new vocabulary
[SPEAKER_02]: people are using about bio-intelligent
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is crop advisor,
[SPEAKER_02]: Brandon Potter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options in who to choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_02]: ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's only one of the reasons I recommend
HEMBRA genetics collection to my friends
[SPEAKER_02]: and listeners who are looking for a seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's HEMBRA, spelled H-E-M-B-R-A.
[SPEAKER_02]: HEMBRA is not just another seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: HEMBRA is a woman operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: With over 50 breeders and over 500 strains
to choose from, you will certainly find
[SPEAKER_02]: something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_02]: HEMBRA genetics has something for everyone
with over 350 feminized strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 regular varieties, and over 100
autoflower to choose from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Names you know you can trust, like
Humboldt Seed Company, Night Owl,
[SPEAKER_02]: Canorado, in-house genetics, FastBuds,
and Gnome Automatics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money,
[SPEAKER_02]: but have no customer service.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invited HEMBRA to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_02]: about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have A-plus customer service with
lightning fast response times.
[SPEAKER_02]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will get
your order out the same day you place it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'll usually receive your seeds in
just a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most seed banks are simply not this
organized or interested in getting your
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds to you this fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But HEMBRA cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: You even get free seeds with every order.

[SPEAKER_02]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_02]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_02]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Copert has the beneficial insects,
mites, and nematodes, microbials,
[SPEAKER_02]: sticky cards, and air distribution units
you need to partner with nature to defend
[SPEAKER_02]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,

[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_02]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: at 900% propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volcani
[SPEAKER_02]: Agriculture Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_02]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.

your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is crop advisor,
Brandon Potter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before the break, we were talking about
some of the things to consider when
[SPEAKER_02]: deciding whether or not you were going to
breed indoors or outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while people can certainly breed in
any kind of a substrate, there is this
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting discussion that's been going
on the last few years about biointelligent
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea with biointelligent seeds is
that they are growing in soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: and seeds that are grown in soil have got
a different biological makeup,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they know what to do when they are
presented soil again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the beginning, when I first heard
that, I'm like, that's a really cool idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: being a living soil guy like I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, but I really don't know what the
reasons for that would be, like a seed's a
[SPEAKER_02]: seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, last episode, when we were
talking with Jeff Lowenfels about
[SPEAKER_02]: endophytic bacteria, well, this is where
the whole case for biointelligent seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the idea that there is endophytic
bacteria, which, if you haven't listened
[SPEAKER_02]: to that show yet, is bacteria that spends
some part of its life cycle in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting to find out that these
endophytic bacteria will come up through
[SPEAKER_02]: the roots into the plant and enter a newly
forming seed, and there is, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget what it's called, but it's
another type of bacteria, which means that
[SPEAKER_02]: it is bacteria from the neighboring
environment that lands on the flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it gets folded into the seeds from the
branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these seeds are going to be all
packed up with the bacteria that the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed's gonna need wherever it goes,
which makes it a more reliable,
[SPEAKER_02]: and people are using this term,
biointelligent seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very attracted to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on seeds that are
grown in living soil versus more inert
[SPEAKER_02]: mediums like cocoa or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely agree and am intrigued by
the interactions that are going on with
[SPEAKER_00]: the environmental organisms and the seed
and how they can pass from the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: to the seed and back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am more familiar with fungal
interactions in that way, because fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: also form endophytic relationships within
a plant body, including some within the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am learning more about the bacterial
cycles, the rhizophagy, and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are also, of course,
bacteria within the plant body of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in the embryo of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a plethora of things on the
seed coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the previous practices is often
to be like, oh, put your seeds in hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide or bleach water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would really only do that if you
think there's a pathogen on the seed coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely gonna be differences
in the population that are colonizing
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that are grown in organic substrates
and living soil and things like this
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to cocoa or more sterile media.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still, I say sterile media,
nothing is sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely organisms in there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their population is going to be different
than a different media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different types of organisms, maybe
species as well as total population
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen specific numbers on this,
but in general, I would assume or expect
[SPEAKER_00]: that living soil is going to have higher
diversity and more likely to have
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial organisms, but not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also, you know, pathogens and
latent pathogens can also get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even botrytis can form an endophytic
infection in a cannabis plant potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: and not show symptoms and even get into
the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the plant, the mother plant may have
cannabis on the buds and there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: botrytis on the seed coat mostly,
but some of the seeds may also be
[SPEAKER_00]: internally infected and that's going to be
cultivar and pathophar specific on whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is that yes, there's going to
be a lot of potential beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships that we can exploit and how
you produce the seed will affect that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also a pathogen risk that these
organisms are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing to say about, at least for
endophytic fungi of the aerial parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, so this is the parts of the
plant that are going to be producing the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and will potentially provide the
inocula to colonize the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those fungi are usually acquired
horizontally from the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just your soil, it's where
you're growing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing that plant under a
canopy of a certain tree, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: expose it to a different potential
population of endophytes than if you grew
[SPEAKER_00]: it indoors or under a different species of
canopy tree, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to predict which one's going
to be most beneficial because this is all
[SPEAKER_00]: so new.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know how to manipulate it
in that secondary way from environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulation to help inoculate the seed
with the proper microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are gaining some knowledge of,
oh, this microorganism is beneficial and
[SPEAKER_00]: we can endophyte inoculate the plant
perhaps while it's growing the seed or the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed post-harvest to help it get that
organism associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot unknown about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, the bigger the diversity,
the more diverse the population of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are, the more resilient and more
likely you will have beneficial symbionts
[SPEAKER_00]: in there with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very, very good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, this whole idea of bacteria
and fungus that is on board a seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is brand new science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is really strange to consider the
idea that different seeds from the same
[SPEAKER_02]: mother plant will have different
endophytic bacteria in it because of where
[SPEAKER_02]: it is on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when those seeds are germinated,
[SPEAKER_02]: that bacteria expresses itself differently
in different ways in the different plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to use the word pheno even
though it's not appropriate, but people
[SPEAKER_02]: will understand what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are always talking about different
phenos in one seed run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're realizing now is like,
yeah, there are those different variety
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions within the seed run,
but now it's even more complex because
[SPEAKER_02]: each seed is going to have onboarded
different endophytic bacteria depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: where it was in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was trying to figure out how
influential that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That opens up a whole bunch of new doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioning making seeds under the
canopy of a particular plant or a tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may find out that the fungus that's
being dropped from these plants in its own
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen that's in the air might also be
influencing our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just like a whole new,
brave new world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the way some of these organisms
are inherited by the plant, some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are passed from the parent to the seed,
and that's vertical transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are acquired from the
environment during the plant's life cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants are more prone to acquiring
their endophytic partners, and some lean
[SPEAKER_00]: towards systemic vertical transmission of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of grass endophytes that are
passed parent to offspring, and I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: not sure where cannabis lies along that
continuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a variety and it has a certain
microbiome associated with its internal
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, you grow that a couple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it keeping that through generations?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I'm unclear of for
cannabis, and it might be maybe some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the organisms are kept and some of them
are lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a potential here, too,
for a scientist if they can figure out a
[SPEAKER_00]: stably inherited microbe that they can
sell to breeders or seed producers to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve their existing varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely a marketable product for
someone, if that's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they actually do that for
grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are endophyte-inoculated grasses,
usually fungal endophytes, because grass
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes often have a toxin that is
poisonous to livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've developed these endophytes that
are symbionts with the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help reduce insect herbivory,
but they don't poison the livestock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so let's cycle ourselves back
off the theory and back onto checking
[SPEAKER_02]: these boxes for the new breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the breeder knows why they want to
grow, and they've got an idea of what they
[SPEAKER_02]: want to breed, and they've figured out
whether or not they're going to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor and outdoor and how they're going
to control their pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now they're actually choosing their
plants and the actual characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for an advanced breeder who are going
to go many generations, this can get
[SPEAKER_02]: confusing very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm going to ask you is that if
we're just talking about the first time
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody is making a cross, and so they
are going to be looking for a male that
[SPEAKER_02]: they like, and they are looking for a
female or potentially a group of females
[SPEAKER_02]: that they like to just get this,
what I'll call F1, what are some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant characteristics that you recommend
that a first time breeder look at when
[SPEAKER_02]: considering their males and females?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you're going to have to start
with whatever the breeding goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might have certain goals that are
required, checks that you have to mark
[SPEAKER_00]: off, and some other that are negotiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there might be traits that come up in
your program as you move along that you
[SPEAKER_00]: reprioritize that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, for small scale growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first decision you have to make is are
you doing regular seeds or feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are doing regular seeds,
I actually generally advise against
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing a single male.
[SPEAKER_00]: To choose a single male properly,
you would want to create a bunch of test
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses with a bunch of different males
and pick the male that actually passes on
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes that you want, which is quite a
bit of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how a large scale breeder might do
it, but for a home breeder, that's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of work that I think might be better spent
moving forward in generations as either a
[SPEAKER_00]: half-sib population where you're selecting
the female that you can get a good read on
[SPEAKER_00]: the characteristics from and you're using
a group of males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could do, you know, traditionally
people do pedigree breeding where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: picking one male to one female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the risk with that is if you pick the
wrong male, you send your line down the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong road.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buffering that with a group of
males and you're picking based on
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics you know are present in
the female, it's going to take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But long term, you might be more likely to
reach a product without having to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and start again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so for characteristics that I would
look for in either a male or female,
[SPEAKER_00]: one, you want to have whatever
characteristics you're breeding for should
[SPEAKER_00]: be present in both if possible,
or you're planning on working more
[SPEAKER_00]: generations to get it standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But general vigor, you know, disease
resistance, things like that on top of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, most people will be selecting
for terpene, structure, resin,
[SPEAKER_00]: potency, things like that will be in most
people's selection list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your example, when you have multiple
males, in that example, you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have multiple males and multiple females.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to hit one female with
multiple males and then you're going to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to sift and search the seeds
that that one female puts out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never, I've not heard this multiple
males approach unless people were trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to like do an open pollination and you
know, preserve a line that might be lost
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to work on a population basis,
especially for early, early generations of
[SPEAKER_00]: lines before I start in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so basically why I lean against single
males, let's see, how should I explain
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so when you do a cell thing,
you're increasing the homozygosity to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next generation by 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a full sieve mating,
so a male to a female or one female to a
[SPEAKER_00]: separate female, you're increasing it by
25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes down half if you're doing
a half sieve mating where you're picking
[SPEAKER_00]: one select female mother plant out of a
population of males that pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the slowest form of breeding in
that respect, but you're moving the line
[SPEAKER_00]: forward in a more general way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you're doing the more specific
inbreeding types of breeding that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional, say full sieve is most
traditional for cannabis or cell thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more common now, you're moving it
towards homozygosity a lot faster,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to screen the amount of lines to get
the exceptional plants will be more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to plant larger populations,
you're more likely to take a step down an
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred line that isn't the good step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that multiple males is better
than doing it that way, but for a home
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder or a small scale breeder,
that's the technique I would lean towards
[SPEAKER_00]: more of like an open pollinated variety
production method rather than inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you inbreed, you're generally
producing parent lines to make hybrids out
[SPEAKER_00]: of and that is going to be much more
difficult for a home breeder to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional hybrids than someone with a
really large operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that some people resist going
about their breeding projects because they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't believe that they have got like a
lot of room for large sifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we all idealize large sifts and in
a perfect world where you've got lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: time, labor and space, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when a new breeder says to me,
oh, I would really like to cross this and
[SPEAKER_02]: this, but I don't really have all that
much room for a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually just say, just do it dude or
person, just go ahead and do it and get
[SPEAKER_02]: your first one done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to, you can always get
better as new projects come about for you
[SPEAKER_02]: and then after your original cross,
if you're going to start inbreeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: well then you can fine tune it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk about a lot of these different
variables that we want to control for,
[SPEAKER_02]: but am I right that controlling for all
these variables is really about getting
[SPEAKER_02]: more and more sophisticated and if you've
got your male line that you like and your
[SPEAKER_02]: female line that you like, just get them
in the same damn space and let nature do
[SPEAKER_02]: its thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to overthink this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes back to what your goals
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want to make, say you want to
make seed to have seed to phenyl hunt for
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of your life, you could do that
in one grow and if you have two lines that
[SPEAKER_00]: you like, smash them together,
you have seed and you can either move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward generational with that seed or
just phenyl hunt that seed forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, especially if someone just
wants, oh, I just want a bunch of dank
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and have it forever, you could get
two elite female clones that you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: like, put them together and other people
would start a seed company for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very easy if you have access to
those original genetics to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have two lines that you like,
absolutely don't put barriers up for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get it done, make the seeds and see
what you end up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different directions you
could take that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an indoor grower and you have
those plants on hold, you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: back-cross breeding type things if you're
selecting for certain traits in one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents, or you can in-breed or you can
just grow that seed for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we now are talking about being in a
situation where we have chosen either one
[SPEAKER_02]: or now, I'm liking your case for multiple
males, and you've got your one or multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: females depending on what your goals are
and how much space you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do about the pollen dropping
from the male when the female is ready for
[SPEAKER_02]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because since you're gonna be bringing
together two different varieties,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's entirely likely that the male is
going to be ready at a different time as
[SPEAKER_02]: the female.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've not run into this since I've only
done this once.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put them next to each other and I
got lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you speak to this idea of having the
pollen drop at the right time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll probably end up tying this back
into the show to your idea for just maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: bagging some of the branches to collect it
and put it on later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just kind of speak to this idea to the
male and female being ready at different
[SPEAKER_02]: times, which unfortunately happens with
humans too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you have some background on
how long your plants are gonna flower or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, I would start the male first
because even if it's ready first,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll produce pollen for a certain window
of time and you can get your female ready
[SPEAKER_00]: in that time, or you can save the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally females, people like to hold the
pollen off of them until they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have an eight week flower,
maybe week three, so that it has enough
[SPEAKER_00]: stigmas to produce a good seed yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pollinate earlier than that,
it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just might get a lower seed yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your seeds might be bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also have the female and male
together the whole time and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually produce new flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have some different seed ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as the best way to pollinate,
if you can get your male dropping flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: at the right time or a little bit before
that and you hold your male in a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: area until you wanna pollinate,
that is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to save pollen, I personally
try to avoid saving pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been hit or miss for me,
but you can get the pollen collected,
[SPEAKER_00]: remove any flower material from there and
save it with desiccant in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should last theoretically a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never pushed it because saving
pollen has always not worked out well for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always get better seed production when
it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly,
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized pollen producers especially
sometimes have trouble dropping the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can collect the entire flowers,
dry the flowers and then grind them up and
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen will fall out and then apply
that by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always preferable that the pollen
just drops and it's less work and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything works out all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually I would just get rid of the
male as soon as you pollinate,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're leaving it in a tent or
something like that and letting it go
[SPEAKER_00]: until harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree with you about saving
pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have found that most of the time when
I've done that, it gets moist and rots or
[SPEAKER_02]: it starts to clump on the female flower
when I go to apply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in retrospect, this is pretty cheesy,
but when I did my cross, I literally
[SPEAKER_02]: wrapped the male into the female plants
and put them on my deck in a tent and just
[SPEAKER_02]: let them do it naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got lucky because I didn't have to
save it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of people who save
pollen successfully and there are
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since we're talking about somebody
doing this for their first time,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to try to continually keep this as
simple as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where in the process do you normally add
the pollen to the female plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say process, I mean like where
in the flowering cycle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to encourage the pollen
immediately as soon as you start to see
[SPEAKER_02]: pistils or do you want to wait until the
flowers are more mature?
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally I would wait until the
flowers are a little more mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, depending on your situation,
if there is potential for say pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination, you might want to get that
pollen all over the branch or plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making so that if there is a few
pollen grains from a fiber hemp grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple miles away blowing around there,
you've already fully pollinated with your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, with your preferred pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: source to limit potential contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, I would wait until there's a
little more flower and you get better seed
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you know that you have
effectively pollinated your plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of first time breeders, they'll
either add the pollen themselves or put
[SPEAKER_02]: them near each other and they're hoping
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then because they don't have a lot of
experience, they're all like, did it do
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so what are the first visual
signs that the plant has accepted the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen successfully?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it can be hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally the first things that you'll
see is that the pistils kind of start to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also just happen by touching
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you touched them, it might just turn
brown because you touched them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it kind of becomes distinctive once
you get an eye for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a certain way that the pistol
shrivels back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pretty soon within a week,
maybe you can see the ovule start to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop into a seed through the bract.
[SPEAKER_02]: At what point will they start to see seeds
form?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we'll talk more about how long
to let the seeds to run and mature down
[SPEAKER_02]: the line in this conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when will they start seeing the green,
very young seeds start to form?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit plant dependent,
depending on the structure of their
[SPEAKER_00]: bracteal that's surrounding what's going
to become the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as a week, I can see them
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they usually appear white at first and
the pistils still are attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of can see them poking out
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hit on feminized seeds briefly,
and I want to go back to that for one
[SPEAKER_02]: moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this show is not about breeding or
making feminized seeds and their
[SPEAKER_02]: importance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done that on other shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would just like you to speak to the
idea of the first time breeder considering
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not they want to make feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just walk us through what those
considerations might be for the first time
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely positives and
negatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first positive for a female only
breeding project is that you're getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: read on both sides of whatever cross
you're going to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make more effective selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major drawback to feminized seed,
especially for home producers,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it's less reliable and that some
plants don't reverse as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're more likely to have a pollen
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a nicking failure where,
especially you mentioned earlier about
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the male flowers at the right time
as the female is ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a short flowering indica and
you're trying to cross that to a long
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering tropical variety, you might want
to have the short flowering variety be the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen donor or you're going to have to
flower that long flowering variety far
[SPEAKER_00]: before the short flowering variety because
you could trigger a tropical variety and
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't produce pollen for another
eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, the other plants done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with feminized seed, you're more likely
to get a pollen failure, like I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: where either you're going to have to put
extra work into collecting the flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: helping that pollen escape, or it just
doesn't produce very viable pollen and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get lower seed yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and you don't want to be, if you're
having a long-term breeding project,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're having pollination issues from
the beginning, that's a red flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some varieties are going to be better
as regular varieties for breeding because
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For home breeders or seed producers,
but as far as functionality, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, feminized seed isn't genetically
modified or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I'm aware, there is no
functional difference in the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are grown from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed female, feminized seed to
regular seed, you can breed feminized seed
[SPEAKER_00]: only for generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, those are the major drawback I
see about feminized seed is pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: production and you have to understand at
least some about the technology of how to
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse a plant, which is pretty
accessible nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead and take our second
short break.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we come back, we're going to talk
about judging when to collect the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and harvest them, handling them,
and prepping them for whatever you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do next.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is crop advisor, Brandon
[SPEAKER_02]: Potter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've discovered the benefits of
using cannabis, it's a very small step to
[SPEAKER_02]: start making your own edibles,
gummies, lotions, tinctures, and
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrated oils at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Magical butter has been helping cannabis
consumers become self-sufficient for over
[SPEAKER_02]: a decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the easy to use magical butter
countertop botanical extractor,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can create high quality cannabis
products to your exact specifications at a
[SPEAKER_02]: fraction of the cost of store bought
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk a lot on this show about the
importance of home growing so you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to rely on others to feel healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the magical butter machine can
empower your personal health by putting
[SPEAKER_02]: you in control of how you use cannabis in
your daily life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been making my own butters and oils
on the stove for years and I much prefer
[SPEAKER_02]: the ease of using the magical butter
machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just set it and walk away.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the simple touch of a button,
the magical butter machine grinds,
[SPEAKER_02]: heats, stirs, and steeps your herbal
extract all at the correct time interval
[SPEAKER_02]: and temperature for the perfect infusion
every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a result, you achieve your desired
infusion easily, safely, and consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out the magical butter Instagram to
see the machine in action.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't feel like you have to go it
alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a huge community on Facebook
called Magical Butter Users United,
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing recipes and best practices so you
can learn at your own pace from others who
[SPEAKER_02]: are already doing it successfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is the time to get your own magical
butter machine and save money while
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoying cannabis.

[SPEAKER_02]: One of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_02]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be fun, sure, but so many
varieties in one pack is a sign of an
[SPEAKER_02]: immature seed line that hasn't been worked
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer my auto flowers to be worked
enough that each phenom in the pack really
[SPEAKER_02]: captures the aspects that the breeder was
intending.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why I recommend gnome automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_02]: automatic flowering cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gnome automatic seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_02]: recognizable by its traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Traits that were hard earned, so that you
can have your best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gnome Automatics became a trusted and
loved brand in cannabis over the last 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years as Mandalorian Genetics and recently
changed their name to Gnome Automatics.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that has changed is the
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Founder Dan Jimmy continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_02]: variety he releases for you to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out the Gnome Automatics Instagram
at gnome underscore automatic to see the
[SPEAKER_02]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can score gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_02]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farms interested in bulk seeds of more
than a thousand should reach out through
[SPEAKER_02]: the website too.
[SPEAKER_02]: While on the website, be sure to check out
the Gnome Automatics shirts and other
[SPEAKER_02]: merch section.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want reliable seeds, hand built
from effort, expert selection and
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, choose Gnome Automatics.
[SPEAKER_02]: For decades, Americans have enjoyed
cannabis flowers and joints and bongs and
[SPEAKER_02]: bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now with the normalization of cannabis
use increasing across the country,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have the opportunity to enjoy smoking
cannabis luxuries that simply were not
[SPEAKER_02]: attainable before.
[SPEAKER_02]: North Coast, hand rolls, blunts,
cannons, rosin infused donuts and canigars
[SPEAKER_02]: available in the state of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: North Coast focuses on flavor over
everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of growing their own flower,
North Coast goes out into the cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: community and creates relationships with
the best growers working with the best new
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis varieties available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely heavy THC is a factor, but North
Coast focuses on aroma, complex terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles and taste that continues
throughout the entire smoking experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: The North Coast team curates flowers like
others curate art.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seek out the best talent,
build relationships helps them take their
[SPEAKER_02]: product to the highest levels and then
buys their well-cured flowers in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: hand roll them just for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like their hand blown glass tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And North Coast has branched out beyond
canigars into rosin solvent-less THCA
[SPEAKER_02]: diamonds and exceptional hash rosin carts
for on the go cannabis connoisseurs too.
[SPEAKER_02]: North Coast provides you with attainable
luxury, offering you an ultra premium
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking experience at a price that seems
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And repeatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: To find out more about North Coast line of
cannabis products, visit their Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: at northcoast.rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's northcoast.rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when in Michigan, ask for North Coast
at your favorite shop, North Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Los and my guest
today is crop advisor, Brandon Potter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are at the big finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've got plants that have got
seeds in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have successfully pollinated and we are
so grateful to have reached this point
[SPEAKER_02]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chances are by the time somebody is at
this point, they have already grown
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they know how to successfully grow and
harvest cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your experience, are there any other
particular care instructions that are
[SPEAKER_02]: different than growing a regular plant
when you're growing for seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking like different nutrients that
you would normally use or different light
[SPEAKER_02]: or I don't know, anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything different when a seed is
being grown for, excuse me, when a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: is being grown for seed than when we're
just growing it for smokeable,
[SPEAKER_02]: usable flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally I would give it more of a veg
nutrient type profile through its entire
[SPEAKER_00]: life than if I were smoking for flour and
I wouldn't do any type of flushing or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the plant to kind of send us on
its own, not because it's being starved of
[SPEAKER_00]: any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, it's pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: To growing for flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a lot of folks, trying to figure
out when to harvest is one of the more
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging aspects because for many
people, if they're doing photos,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people are just looking for a
20%ish of trichomes that have gone amber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, when you're a more
experienced cultivator, you will know how
[SPEAKER_02]: to recognize swollen flowers and the color
changes and the change in the pistols and
[SPEAKER_02]: all these extra things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really the first rule of thumb that
most novice cultivators go with is the 20%
[SPEAKER_02]: amber trichomes, unless it's an auto
flower, which don't really amber up the
[SPEAKER_02]: same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you look for when deciding when to
harvest the seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've all gotten seeds that didn't
look like they had finished maturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for many seed varieties, we're looking
for a darkened seed potentially with
[SPEAKER_02]: striping on it, depending on what kind of
a plant it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've all bought seed packs that
looked like the seeds were not mature and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're keeping our fingers crossed that
they germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you look for in considerations
when you're judging when to pull the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: down?
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I base it on time from when
I know pollination occurred, as well as I
[SPEAKER_00]: usually dig out a couple seeds and squeeze
them, see how full they are, how mature
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you're sacrificing those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it should also be noted that a lot of
seed, the color of seed and the striping
[SPEAKER_00]: on seed is really variety dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you have a seed that's
supposed to be brown and tiger striped and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's white, then it's probably immature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the variety freak show has notoriously
light colored seeds that are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: misshapen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all they ever do, even if you
let them go forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, you want to be able to
squeeze a seed and have it be resistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: full of an embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you squeeze it, you'll see a now dead
or dying embryo pop out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to see the completely
formed little radical and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should start to be getting a hard seed
coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a few tests like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the majority of seeds are like that,
you're probably good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't hurt to let it go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard people claim you can get over
mature seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't think that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're cleaning your seed at
the end of it, you might get a lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and things like that that will blow
off when you're cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that one of the things you use to
judge when to pull the seeds, you said
[SPEAKER_02]: days from pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dig into that a little bit more if you
would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you looking for a particular number of
days or a certain number of days in
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship to how long the bloom cycle
is supposed to be for this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: female?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a little more on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, I use the same timeframe
regardless of the variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't produced seeds on any 16-week
varieties, so I can't say it's necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: true for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it would still apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you pollinate based on this
timeframe, there would be a mature seed
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in there for 10 weeks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say two weeks is the absolute
minimum to get viable seed if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do something really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preferably, you want to let it go at least
four weeks and six weeks is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can let something go at least six
weeks and then start looking at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it'll be just completely
finished at four weeks and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really need that extra two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it hurts to let it go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you have something like botrytis
happening and that'll start infecting and
[SPEAKER_00]: eating your seeds, there's really no harm
in letting it overmature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me push on this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said two is the minimum, six would be
optimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we are going to pollinate our
plant a week or two into the flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle, that kind of lines up with an
eight-week plant, which is give or take,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a pretty common bloom cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be, unless you're doing a
specialty plant or something that has an
[SPEAKER_02]: especially long flowering cycle,
that you might want to pull those seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: just simply when the flowers are done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that oversimplified?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying that you might be pulling
them earlier than six weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm suggesting that if your plant is
going to start to flower and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinate it at somewhere between week one
and two of the flowering process and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you said you want a minimum of two weeks,
but more like six weeks put forward to
[SPEAKER_02]: allow for all the seeds to mature,
when you add those two weeks and the six
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, you're at eight weeks, which is one
of the most common bloom cycles for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sounding like in many ways,
many or if not most cases, it's not really
[SPEAKER_02]: a different time to pull the seeds as it
is just when you would pull the flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be very convenient if you have an
under branch that you pollinated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you still want the flower from that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can usually just harvest them at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do pollinate something, especially if
it's later in the cycle of something that
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm going to cut down for flower,
then I'll pick a lower branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can leave that lower branch alive
and let the seeds mature a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you have an eight-week flower,
you pollinate it week four or five,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you want to let it go beyond where
you would harvest for a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one time I did this, I intentionally
just let it go until I was a good two
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks beyond when I would have flowered it
because I was so concerned about the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: not fully maturing and ripening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would have gone through all this
effort for nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this eight-week plant, I was looking to
harvest it at week 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was surprised it actually just
started dropping the seeds onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm all like, oh, well, I would say
that that's probably the most sure sign
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's possible I was misreading that
sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: What stage are we at when the plant is
actually literally dropping seeds into the
[SPEAKER_02]: pot or onto the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends what varieties you're working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an atomistic trait where it's
ancestrally wild cannabis plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: shatter and drop their seeds a lot more
readily than the domesticated varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a plant like that,
yeah, you want to harvest it before it
[SPEAKER_00]: drops its seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's dropping its seed, they're
definitely ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the only that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And say if you're outdoors and it's
getting rained on, I've seen seed
[SPEAKER_00]: germinating in colas before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to avoid those kind of
negatives to letting it go too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, there's not a harm to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you collected a piece of plastic
under the plant and collected those seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're in this situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds are dropping from the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If some are dropping, chances are your
vast majority of them are mature and ready
[SPEAKER_02]: to rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any best practices for
harvesting a seeded plant that is dropping
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because certainly we want to be more
gentle with this plant because we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to be dropping the seeds all over the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I just cut it and put it in
a bag like right then and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's as little motion as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's exactly what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a big area of seed production,
I'd lay down plastic before I start
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting plants down and then collect the
fallen seed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's if it's just one plant,
I just put the bag under it, cut it right
[SPEAKER_00]: into the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you walk us through the the next
steps of take us from where we're at now
[SPEAKER_02]: to to having clean seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what just walk us through?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot of different ways
that people do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are talking about somebody who is a
first time breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not going to have all the sexy
gear that we see, you know, professional
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just walk us through like the baseline
of what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do first is just drive the
plant material usually at ambient
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to use heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a dehumidifier, you want to
keep the humidity low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plant is kind of crispy,
that's when I would thresh it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot easier to thresh plants that
are just like crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to save the flower from
the seeded bud that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just throw it away because it
gets really beat up and isn't the best
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, but you could you could
absolutely save it, especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: something like cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But regardless, I would get it crispy and
then you just basically chuck it right off
[SPEAKER_00]: the branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get real rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take those flowers and grind them between
your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be too careful at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds should be relatively resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're crushing them by grinding them
in your hand, then they probably were dead
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do that until it's kind of like a
consistent powder seed plant mixture and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can start to separate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separate that material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always use I always recommend using
gloves at this point because any time I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: touching the seeds, I really want to limit
my human oils onto the seeds for the
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons we mentioned earlier about the
vital biology that's on the outside of the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people handle their
seeds like they are like a little
[SPEAKER_02]: impervious suitcases.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I go a little more gentle
than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely touch seed without gloves
during that that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear gloves because grinding plant
material in between your hands is not
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm you know, I've never thought about
it, how the oil affects the seed coat
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it has some effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't actually think about it at
all until last episode with Jeff Lohenfels
[SPEAKER_02]: when he was explaining the the bacteria on
the inside and outside of the seed that
[SPEAKER_02]: are carried with it where the seed is
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the the research of I think the
scientist's name was James White,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it's totally changed my
relationship with with with the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, handling the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so now that you've kind of like
pulverized the flowers in your hands and a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of seeds are like just like raining
out of it for you, hopefully, you still
[SPEAKER_02]: have got all of this plant material mixed
in with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're just producing a
little bit, just going at it on a on a on
[SPEAKER_02]: a flat surface with a credit card might be
tedious, but it would work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there is there a nice best practice you
like for removing the plant material from
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: For home scale, I do one of a couple
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will grind the plant material through a
screen sometimes to get it really fine
[SPEAKER_00]: when.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so when you threshold plant,
you have just this pile of whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of shake it in a tub and the
seed will sink to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, you might want to just
pick the plant material off the top and
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of some of the bigger stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I'll grind it through like a
spaghetti strainer screen and make all
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant material more fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually the seed sits on top of that
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like the first sift of plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw away everything that ground
through the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I pour that seed into like a
dishwashing tub and I kind of shake it
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen people do this a few
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also buy or build machines
that use vacuum cleaners to air clean that
[SPEAKER_00]: are more precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just for the home grower, just a
dishwasher tub, shake it around,
[SPEAKER_00]: move it to one corner, and then I blow
into the tub kind of in the direction of
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds and all the light seed and plant
material will fly away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be a little bit careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to lose some good seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much any air cleaner is going to
remove a little bit of good seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is that you're removing,
you know, 95 percent of the trash and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're leaving yourself with viable seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're sorting seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you looking for for seeds that
you are going to reject?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have like, it depends on what
size lot you're doing and what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: saving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just saving them for breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I might, you know, have a lower
standard for defects and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to give it to people,
I'd clean them more precisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally you can, light colored seed
is usually pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you pick up a seed, it just
crunches in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't filled with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just toss those away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cleaning and they'll still be in
the batch, especially if they still have
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material attached to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have been a little heavier and
survived that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you know your seed variety
well, you'll get a look at what a good,
[SPEAKER_00]: mature, healthy seed looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be able to kind of calibrate
and look for the ones that don't look
[SPEAKER_00]: correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a seed variety that usually
has tiger stripes and you have one that's
[SPEAKER_00]: light and tan, you know, I would toss
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's surprising though, because some
seed, especially, you know, if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: selfing or say you're trying to do a quick
breeding cycle and you only let it go two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, the seed might look green still and
look immature, but it'll still have 70%
[SPEAKER_00]: germination, which could be enough if all
you're doing is breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen any of those seeds yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a strange thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably because they're not released that
way, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, they're part of a breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't really know when people
talk about curing their seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't usually know what they mean,
but we do know that a fresh seed taken
[SPEAKER_02]: right off the plant, given a little bit of
time to dry will then germinate better in
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of weeks than it does on the day
that you take it from the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I actually don't know a whole lot
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you speak to this idea of curing
seeds and letting them dry and to increase
[SPEAKER_02]: germination rates so that when you go to
them, they're actually ready to do their
[SPEAKER_02]: job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is drying it down to a moisture level
where it will be shelf stable for a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's down to 5% moisture is
preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything under 10 and in cold treatment is
also going to stay alive for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another aspect to,
you know, curing or aging your seed a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably a post harvest
maturation, just physiologically that
[SPEAKER_00]: embryo is still doing things after the
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not quite ready to germinate yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plant, you know, a week after
cleaning seed or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might get 50% germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wait two to three weeks,
that'll go up to 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's beyond just because the
moisture content probably won't change
[SPEAKER_00]: that long in that amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my guess is that's mostly some
physiological process within the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's finish up with storing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you've put in all this effort and
you've got your first run of seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're so freaking stoked and you're going
to share them with your friends and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't wait to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got some other stuff you got to do
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're going to need to store it
for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your best practices for storing
seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to that, there's just one
more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to mention, I have heard some
people talk about, you know, some seeds of
[SPEAKER_00]: other species need to what's called
vernalize where they go through a cold
[SPEAKER_00]: period in the winter before they're able
to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard some people report and I
don't have a specific experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they say that they get better
germination if they put their seed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just wait those two or three weeks
before trying to plant it, but they put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a refrigerator or a freezer for that
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they've compared that just
to waiting and I'm kind of curious to try
[SPEAKER_00]: that sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually when we're waiting,
the seed is in a cold vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically all our seed is getting that
treatment anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so when your seed is dried down
to a good percentage, which should be
[SPEAKER_00]: under 10%, preferably under eight or so
percent moisture, you can put it in either
[SPEAKER_00]: a freezer or a refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually keep my stuff in a refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freezers should be okay as long as the
moisture level is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably best for long-term
storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with either a refrigerator or
a freezer usually arises from when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the seed in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to have it in an airtight
container, maybe with a little desiccant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it in the freezer refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take the seed out to access that
session whenever you're ready to grow it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to let it acclimate to whatever
the room temperature is before you open
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like if you take that say you have
it in a little plastic container and you
[SPEAKER_00]: take that out of the freezer, it's going
to be instantly covered with moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you open that before the seed
reaches, before it all equalizes in
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, the same thing will happen to
the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what will limit the viability
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than temperature, more than the air
exposure, it's going to be moisture that
[SPEAKER_00]: is a danger to seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've got them cured and we've got
them stored and we know that we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring it back to temperature before we
open the container, especially if we're
[SPEAKER_02]: only going to take out some of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to reclose the container
with all that condensation that it
[SPEAKER_02]: suddenly pulled out of the air because
you'd risk either mold or heck,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe even potentially accidental
germination, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking out a little pack and
you're going to plant all the seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you don't have to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's like a stored seed that you're
taking a little aliquot out of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to damage the seed that
goes back into storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aliquot, there's my word for the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard that in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we wrap up and I let you go,
Brandon, is there anything else that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've done this process so many times and
now you're doing it professionally,
[SPEAKER_02]: is there anything else looking back on
this show where you're all like,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually there's one more thing that the
new breeder is going to want to know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that jumps out into your
brain right away that we may not have
[SPEAKER_02]: covered that we want to go back and
punctuate before we wrap up?
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a couple of points if
someone asked me advice as a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would say is know your
germplasm that you're working with and
[SPEAKER_00]: what is available before you start
designing your program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just cross things because you like
the name or whatever, and also expect
[SPEAKER_00]: things to react differently than you think
they're going to when you cross them.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say know your germplasm,
break that out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like know the two lines that you're
working with and have grown them and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I would say have grown them and have
some, at least have seen the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in cannabis especially will attach
to names and have these, I was guilty of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, where you get these ideas,
you fantasize about a plant based on its
[SPEAKER_00]: description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's not what it is when you get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you have the plant and you fantasize
about a cross because this plant and this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant would make a really good
intermediate, but then you cross them and
[SPEAKER_00]: the intermediate doesn't exist,
it's totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be flexible and just work with
what you have, not the fantasy of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have been running into a
problem with that myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have this fantasy of crossing sour
diesel to jet fuel OG because I love like
[SPEAKER_02]: both of those very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But having grown sour diesel a couple
times, it is so likely to both throw male
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers and express itself with intersex
flowers that I'm just not willing to breed
[SPEAKER_02]: with it and cause all these potential
problems down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize that until I started
growing the sour diesel that we have today
[SPEAKER_02]: and realizing that most of the folks who
are working with sour diesel are expecting
[SPEAKER_02]: male flowers and intersex flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, I guess I probably won't
go down that path because I did my
[SPEAKER_02]: research on the germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's also surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some things that are prone to
intersex that when you cross them,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the plants in the cross will be
intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if I took it another generation,
it would start causing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to discourage people either.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just trying to make an F1 and
one of them is intersex, it might solve
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternatively, I've had plants that were
never produced a male flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crossed them, all of the seeds are
intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither of the parents seemingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the parents was deep trunk,
which I'm not aware of intersex problems
[SPEAKER_00]: with deep trunk, and the other was a
clone, Les Barado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the background of Les Barado,
but the clone itself never had a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost every single seed is just almost
50-50.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything else to add before we
wrap up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the last point that I try to
impose on newer growers is consider
[SPEAKER_00]: working with higher populations,
even if you have a small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be breaking plant count numbers
for a lot of people, and this is why I
[SPEAKER_00]: would prefer, say, if you're going to
regulate gardens, do it on space rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than plant counts, because you can fit 100
plants or more in a two-by-four if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have them stunted in little trays,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not selecting, especially when
you're making initial crosses and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing genes, where you're just
selecting for one major gene, but you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the gene pool broad, like if I'm
doing a photo autocross and I'm not trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to select specific phenotypes yet,
I'll do those original generations as
[SPEAKER_00]: populations in small tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're still hitting large selection
numbers, and I still will make especially
[SPEAKER_00]: selections against plants that get
diseased and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're in a very small space.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably not something that's going
to happen with the first time breeder,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that sounds like it might be a really
good set, too, because as soon as you do
[SPEAKER_02]: this once and you have success,
you're suddenly going to want to do way
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger sifts, so you have more options,
I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Brandon, thank you so much for
coming on Shaping Fire and sharing your
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to follow along with
Brandon, there are three different places
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can you can be in contact with
him if you wish.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first, I definitely recommend
following his personal Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing Higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, there's a lot of great plant
photos, but the commentary that Brandon
[SPEAKER_02]: offers on this or that project that he's
working on is engaging and educational,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, I'm a big fan of the company that
Brandon has started with a couple of his
[SPEAKER_02]: friends, Mycophyte Solutions, which
focuses on crop advising with a
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative and mycology mindset for
agriculture.
