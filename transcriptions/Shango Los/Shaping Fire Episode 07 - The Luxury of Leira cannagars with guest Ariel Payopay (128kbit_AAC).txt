[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things in life that take a
lot of effort to make, are made with
[SPEAKER_00]: quality in mind, and are really,
truly premium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about things like shoes that
were handmade by an actual cobbler,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a coat that is so impervious to weather
that you feel safe when you put it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some coats, like maybe the one your
grandpa used to wear hunting, are so
[SPEAKER_00]: well-made that they just look better the
more wear and tear they get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some expensive sports cars, too,
have a certain purr that just sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may not always have the money today to
buy these luxury items we desire,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no doubt that we respect them
for their beauty, quality, and
[SPEAKER_00]: craftsmanship.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much like that on the cannabis
market so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most products are whipped together and put
on the market as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we see so much uncured cannabis
flower out there, and why some vaporizers
[SPEAKER_00]: are so unsatisfying to hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're focusing on one of the few
cannabis products anywhere in the country
[SPEAKER_00]: that drips luxury in craftsmanship.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we are gonna profile Lyra Cannigars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I wanna be clear that this is not a
paid spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm focusing on them because of their
leadership in the industry, and because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just totally a fan of their attention
to detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's guest is Ariel Peope, founder of
Lyra Cannigars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lyra's Cannigars are handmade,
contain ultra-premium ingredients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a style and price to match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Ariel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Ariel, you know, in an industry when
so much retail packaging is ugly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have to question the quality of the
cannabis contained within, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's encouraging to come across a product
like yours that is not only beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also packed with top-shelf cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you decide to serve the
ultra-premium market instead of the mass
[SPEAKER_00]: market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a lot of labor put into
creating a Cannigar, and so it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, impossible to make it cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for somebody to be paying that amount
of $420 for a six-inch Cannigar,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you wanna make sure you have
premium cannabis and no complaints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wanna sugarcoat crap, you know,
so that's just my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you excited about the ultra-premium
market because you wanted to reach out to
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular audience, or is it just
because you are a connoisseur and you
[SPEAKER_00]: really only wanted to work with
ultra-premium inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw opening for it because nobody
was really marketing their products that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few, but I just felt like this
Cannigar would set a garden apart,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if they have premium product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people want premium product,
they'll pay the money for it, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to, you know, be in a position
that you're in where you're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: competing on price, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So many, you know, cannabis product folk,
they're all trying to get the cheapest
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs possible so they can get their
price low so the maximum number of people
[SPEAKER_00]: can buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I've been an entrepreneur
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually prefer, you know, not having
the cheapest product in the market because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a certain satisfaction in
providing quality, and that sounds to be
[SPEAKER_00]: your approaches as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, because there's a couple of
Cannigar companies that I'm starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: see show up, which is pretty cool,
what I was expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I started my brand, I told
myself, look, I'm sticking to premium
[SPEAKER_01]: quality materials, solvent-less oil,
and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a big challenge trying to find
that perfect garden that met those
[SPEAKER_01]: qualities.
[SPEAKER_01]: There came a point where I did get laid
off with a job, and I was desperate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all these gardens that I was meeting
weren't meeting my expectations,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I almost jumped ship and just went
with it, and just hopefully, hoped that my
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannigars would work out, but I was,
like, still worried because the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But luckily, last minute, an opportunity
was brought to me by Goleaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: They contacted me, and I was like,
oh my god, these guys are, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect, all organic, and they care about
the product that they give their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers, versus, like, you can tell when
you look at other gardens, they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: all about creating large yields and making
that profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want that with my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as how you judge quality,
I mean, obviously, all of the legal states
[SPEAKER_00]: are having issues with pesticides and all
different flavors, but what were you
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for that you would call quality
flower to go into your Cannigars?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what were the standards you were
looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the standards you were looking
to have met that you didn't really see
[SPEAKER_00]: being met until you met Goleaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just looking for a good garden that
cared about their customers, and they grew
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and didn't use any, like,
crazy pesticides, and they had good
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they make your rosin as well,
or do you do that in-house?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we make the rosin also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, also, we get my friend, which is
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started working after me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been, like, best friends since high
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name's, he runs Polar Ice Tracks,
so he's good for making, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: full melt bubble hash, and he created the
hard press rosin press, and he started
[SPEAKER_01]: working there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we collect his bubble hash,
and we press that into rosin for our
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannigars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything's solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's handcrafted.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing, I try to make sure that
there's nothing negative people can say
[SPEAKER_01]: about our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when I first found out about
your Cannigars, and I was looking into
[SPEAKER_00]: them, I'm like, wow, these are incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you just would have
used, you know, premium Gold Leaf flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would have been amazing just in and
of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What possessed you to go ahead and put
dabble rosin oil in there as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the more concentrates you put on
there, the slower the burn, and plus you
[SPEAKER_01]: get more flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, people love rosin now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin's like the new thing since people
are trying to be clean with their cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, I looked at it like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I got into this, I saw what was
going on with food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's talking about non-GMOs,
this and that, and then you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis market booming.
[SPEAKER_01]: With like hydro setups, cocoa setups,
just feeding bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, these guys are
trying their best to make their money,
[SPEAKER_01]: but nobody's really trying to create that
premium product where you let the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: grow the way it's supposed to be grown,
you know, with living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Gold Leaf is the only garden that I
know of in Washington state that can
[SPEAKER_01]: provide that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're stuck with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, wow, how did that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a perfect match.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I told you, if I told you the story
from beginning to end, well, it's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: end yet, but like everything's just
falling into place somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how it happens, but you got
the top flower producer in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the top flower, but premium flower
producer in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of the premium bubble hash
producers in Washington and also started
[SPEAKER_01]: his own rosin press.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now you have us, the Canigars.
[SPEAKER_01]: All under one garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like what garden do you know in
the world that has that and can say
[SPEAKER_01]: they're clean green?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like that's where you get the
whole ultra premium vibe behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it was actually about a year
ago, actually like very much a year ago
[SPEAKER_00]: that I first got turned on to Gold Leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were on our way driving down to Emerald
Cup and Aaron Varney of Dockside was in
[SPEAKER_00]: the van with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he whipped out some of the Gold Leaf
Tangy, which is just like insane,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you smoke Tangy and go in
somewhere, you don't smell like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smell like Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tangy, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, you know, and their
packaging is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you're going to be stuck with
somebody, those are good folks to be stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an interesting point you made
though about how adding the rosin oil
[SPEAKER_00]: slows the burn on the Canigars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, we all know that when
you're smoking a joint, it can run or it
[SPEAKER_00]: can burn down faster than you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can imagine that when your Canigars
are big and long and you're passing it
[SPEAKER_00]: around a bunch of folks, because,
you know, your Canigars can just,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can serve a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that having the rosin in
there so that the burn is slow is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how long does a typical Canigar last?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they've got to be more than 20
minutes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Corona, the sixth inch one,
it can last from, I've heard from five to
[SPEAKER_01]: six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a, I know of a couple that took it
to Fiji and that's all they brought and it
[SPEAKER_01]: lasts them for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just took drags right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know the longer ones, they burn a lot
slower than the petite ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, maybe because it's just
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you first light the tip of the
longer ones, like you don't see it budge
[SPEAKER_01]: hardly ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to experience it to understand
what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I figured that out, I was like,
damn, I got to brand this and I got to
[SPEAKER_01]: market this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what sizes do the Canigars come in and
do you see them being sold to different
[SPEAKER_00]: niches in the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have our petite Corona, which is
eight grams of flour and two grams of
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin and it's wrapped with the cannabis
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one retails for $300 and that's
around four inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our big one is the Corona,
which is six inches, 12 grams of flour and
[SPEAKER_01]: three grams of rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That retails for 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting because at first,
some people get sticker shock off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: price because it's like, oh my God,
420 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you see it on, like your
Instagram or something, you see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this beautiful Canigar and it's
wrapped with multicolored leaves and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: in this beautiful packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take to make,
say, for example, a Corona?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because obviously there's a lot of hand
artisan love going into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it takes around an hour and then up
to three to four weeks to cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the flourishes that really makes
the final product look really regal is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you seal the ends with purple wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: What brought you to decide that you wanted
to do something extra like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, because when I was in medical,
man, like packaging was horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had horrible packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always talk about how great of a
product they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like buy this, it's the greatest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they throw it in like a Mylar
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, come on, dude, like show that
you care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show that you care about your customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them the full experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm all about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the first vigil appearance to
unwrapping it to like everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want my customers to get that full
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: People remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an entire brand experience,
especially since I would imagine a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are using these for celebrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into something as
deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there is more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage loyalty in the customers you
already have, but you certainly don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time and you're not ready to hire
someone full time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend blunt branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blunt branding principles, Kirsten Nelson
and Anthony Garcia are focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that is pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: the most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and Anthony will help you engage
new customers funnel them to your point of
[SPEAKER_00]: sale and keep them coming back to you and
telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with blunt branding on three
projects now for various clients and every
[SPEAKER_00]: single time they have done more than they
have promised and over delivered on
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making me a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every friend I've referred them
to has come back to thank me and that just
[SPEAKER_00]: does not happen every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grab a pen and paper because the
website address is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_00]: give blunt branding a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_00]: while using cutting edge technology in the
background that make all of this easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic and trackable.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Ariel Peope, founder of Lyra
[SPEAKER_00]: Kanigars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we were talking about
the artisan craftsmanship that goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: making these and how these take an hour or
more to make and all of the very ultra
[SPEAKER_00]: premium ingredients that go inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you already have a preexisting
background in making cigars and such or
[SPEAKER_00]: did you have to teach yourself how to do
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of taught myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I saw people doing the Kanigars with
the string method where they form the
[SPEAKER_01]: cores around the skewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, I mean, it looked awesome to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first person I saw do that was an
artist called Afgu, Afgu Head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's the one that like blew my mind
with these Kanigars like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can actually make Kanigars.
[SPEAKER_01]: With cannabis, and I just watched how he
did his thing, but I thought in my head,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, there's no way this could be
done in full scale production because like
[SPEAKER_01]: that would take hours to like slowly twine
a buds around a skewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't even bother doing that,
but I was just always in my head trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out a way to speed that core
process up because building the core,
[SPEAKER_01]: a clean core is the biggest foundation to
creating clean Kanigars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my buddy, I told my buddy,
surrounding the hard press guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: he also got fascinated by the Kanigars and
he got into it, but he was still doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: string method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, there has to be another
way around this because I'm not doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing with string.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not going to sell to like a garden
or anything if I told him I wanted to go
[SPEAKER_01]: into business with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So later on as he was rolling these
Kanigars, he just quit because he said it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just time consuming, but he told me a
tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you know what, if you're going
to get into this, try this method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, I took off with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yup, this is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it takes to make these
Kanigars in full scale production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just attacked it once I figured
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just abstract enough of a
description to let us know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: developed some best practices that are now
your trade secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you were trying to figure out how
to make the production as reliable as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, did you find that you were just
doing trial and error or did you go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and research how cigars are made and then
kind of like cross apply that
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing technique or did you not
even really bother to go to how tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: cigars are made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I watched, man, I love YouTube
because I watched so many YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: documentaries on how they rolled cigars
and just because you only need that one
[SPEAKER_01]: little tip to just spark that idea in your
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, I watched hours and it only took
me like a minute of all those hours that I
[SPEAKER_01]: watched to figure out like certain tricks
on my Kanigars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you really want to figure out
how to roll a Kanigar, you'll get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're just going to keep bugging
people, they're not going to tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: their trade secrets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I am with a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't have patience for people to
teach me stuff or do stuff for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to figure things out on my own,
which is why, which is a cool thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: how I got into branding it and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was, I got, I taught my,
well, I didn't teach myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to school for graphic design and I
have little like photography skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured I'd just combine that and
help brand my, help market my product for
[SPEAKER_01]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You certainly have an aesthetic quality
because the whole package from from your
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and showing the pictures to
creating the product to all the way to the
[SPEAKER_00]: displays that you make for the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's an entire ecosystem of
gorgeous, which it's probably demanded to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to get the prices that you're
asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are having so much success,
I can imagine that you have to continually
[SPEAKER_00]: add more folks in manufacturing rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you know, you spent all of this
time kind of being mentored by YouTube and
[SPEAKER_00]: trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that it's challenging to teach
the new hires how to do this properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you find some people that just
don't have the chops for it and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: have to like get somebody else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right now I just taught,
I've taught my brother and then my wife
[SPEAKER_01]: and also my sister-in-law how to roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my brother only took him like a week
to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took them like a week or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you get into it, you're,
you're, you're flowing after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the real, the real problem is,
is like streamlining the whole process,
[SPEAKER_01]: like making sure that we're always have
like a stock of fresh leaves that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: use or making sure the rosin is always
there and the flower is always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the biggest, the biggest pain is,
is, is the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you can't just use all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to use the nice ones, you know,
and at all the leaves we grab,
[SPEAKER_01]: you only use like a small percentage of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that is especially cool
about how the Kanegars look is that a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of them have got two-tone leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we all love how,
you know, different ladies express
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves in the leaves, especially,
you know, if it's outdoor and fall time
[SPEAKER_00]: comes, you know, and they start to,
they start to change color and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it really adds to the,
the artisan vibe of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can, you're reminded that
this is a product that's from nature and
[SPEAKER_00]: that these are being made by hand when
they're not, you know, uniform all the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of them, you can almost,
you can see the variety of nature in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people really dig that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what, that's what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I first got into is like,
is there, I always thought like,
[SPEAKER_01]: should there be a way we can make these
like perfect so they look all the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of people was like,
no, it looks, it looks original.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like each one looks unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: With your relationship with, with gold
leaf, did that come with a distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: deal as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you out there going to retailers
yourself, trying to encourage them to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry your product?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have enough product to supply the
retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we only worked with certain retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, are you planning on,
on increasing your production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the idea right now is that you're
setting up, you know, best practices and
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out how to do it and then scaling
up or, or is it, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're already using everything that,
that a gold leaf has available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you're kind of restrained because
of the, the inventory of quality inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of in the middle of that right
now, trying to see which direction I
[SPEAKER_01]: should go with my company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some advisors that I'm speaking to
that will help me find direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, business is all new to me
and doing this is all new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like doing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I thought about like either
licensing out my brand and to other States
[SPEAKER_01]: or even getting my own facility to,
to a bigger market, such as California or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe New York or something like a large,
a large market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are people already asking you about the
licensing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are you already fielding calls
from people who want to know your best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices?
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of messages about,
Hey, come here, come there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we carry your product?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this and that it's like, a lot of
people don't understand is you can't push
[SPEAKER_01]: these out like joints and bonds or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all handcrafted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of investors, they get,
when they look at that, they, they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: see a big return with these, with these
counter guards, but with the large,
[SPEAKER_01]: with large volumes, but you can't,
you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to, you have to respect it as an
art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you rush this, you could ruin the
product, the quality of the product,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and people are only going
to pay the premium price if it is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: a premium product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can imagine that all sorts of folks
who are more interested in the margins
[SPEAKER_00]: than in the quality of the product would
quickly dilute the quality of what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting into it, whether it is an effort
or in inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to go ahead and take our
second short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses everywhere are constantly
striving to reach out to people through
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know though, that trying to reach a
cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the shaping fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_00]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain your service or product
and what sets it apart as desirable and
[SPEAKER_00]: help our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the podcast is young, but growing
at an exceptionally fast rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you become an advertiser on the shaping
fire podcast now, you are going to pay a
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction of the cost we'll be asking for
in just a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet everyone listening both now and to
the back catalog of interviews later will
[SPEAKER_00]: hear about your company again and again
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_00]: listening audience we will have forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is Ariel Peope,
founder of Lyric Cannigars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we were talking about
how much time it takes to make one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these Cannigars and how huge the demand is
and that you really can't meet the demand
[SPEAKER_00]: just because you can only put out so many
of these while keeping the quality high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would seem to me that a big reason for
your success is how gorgeous your social
[SPEAKER_00]: media feed is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a background in social media
or did you hire somebody on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the secret to your special sauce
that just makes your stream so gorgeous?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't have any background in social
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been watching how other brands
do their social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for one, I know my Cannigars are
very limited, so I try to model off of
[SPEAKER_01]: clothing brands such as Supreme,
how they do their marketing in Nike,
[SPEAKER_01]: just showing little snippets of the
product and hyping people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like creating hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to change also the lifestyle
of the image of your cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think so negative about people who
smoke cannabis and I want to change that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're successful CEOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Business owners that smoke cannabis every
day, but they don't like to admit to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that they have my product,
they're like, oh yeah, yeah, I smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people look at it differently like,
oh, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I did my first wedding and they
ordered like 20 Cannigars for their
[SPEAKER_01]: wedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, whoever thought about having
cannabis at their wedding like that is
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly makes it a lot easier for
wealthy, I mean, wealthy stoners,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, to identify with your
product, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so much of cannabis marketing is
like big clouds of smoke and people,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just say not acting in a premium
market kind of way, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your stream is filled with people who
are having some success in their life and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all like, I work hard and I
deserve nicer things because I put in so
[SPEAKER_00]: much effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm enjoying this Cannigar with my
friends on a beach because we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you that that market is not only
large, but really grateful to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something that speaks to the amount of
effort they've put into their own lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just seeing people from all walks of
life being interested in these Cannigars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even people like, I have a lot of cigar
aficionados messaging me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them, they've never tried cannabis
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be like, oh, that is a great
product that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried cannabis, but if that was
in front of me, I'd definitely smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you had that cigar smoker that just,
there was something like, I grew up
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking weed in my high school years,
but as I advanced in life, I came home and
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked blunts and joints or out of a
bong, it just seemed like cannabis grew
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that you've created this more
mature side of cannabis, I want to start
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking weed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always ask people, I have a lot of
friends that used to be big stoners in
[SPEAKER_01]: college or this and that, and then they
tell me they just grew out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what do you mean you grew out
of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You still drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody grows out of drinking unless they
just want to quit due to health reasons or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to know why people want to
quit smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just basically told me they just
got tired of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't feel like they're advancing or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I got that top shelf product where
they're like, yeah, I want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I want to look forward to
this weekend or for the celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is certainly a desirous thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there aren't a lot of products in
cannabis that I kind of fetishize over,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've been following your Instagram
feed for a while now and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, my precious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see these things and I'm like,
oh man, I want one of those for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they really are, they're an art
object as much as they're a smokable
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were mentioning these folks who
toked back in college or whatever and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they got into business and they haven't
toked in a long time, now they suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you those folks need to be careful
too because going from toking all these
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago in college to suddenly hitting a
Tangy and Rosin Canagar, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: one hit could put a novice away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, it's crazy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you smoke these Canagars,
you're super, super high, but you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: tired, which I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've rolled it with Indicas or Sativas and
you're just not tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just because I'm around people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for one, when I smoked a Tangy,
I'm very high and a lot of people are just
[SPEAKER_01]: talking, joking around and it's a cool
thing because it's really a product that's
[SPEAKER_01]: meant to be enjoyed with everyone or maybe
just intimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that most people who buy it
are buying for celebration?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do you even come in contact with
your customers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know who's buying them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people buy them for celebrations
or then I have those customers that just
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke them right as they get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people would pick up a Lyra,
they would be, oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they just crack it open right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, no, dude, save that for a
special occasion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just buy another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, you got money like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, damn, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I aspire to that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so some of those people,
they're coming to get your cigars from all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to talk about your recent
Canagar sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sold a $3,600 Canagar through Diego
Pelser retail store there in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contained 21 grams of Gorilla Glue
number four, four grams of peppermint
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies rosin, and was wrapped with
two-tone cannabis leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, who the hell bought that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really say, but the person that
bought it flew in his private jet just for
[SPEAKER_01]: that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he contact you or the shop ahead of
time to say, hey, I'm flying in,
[SPEAKER_00]: hold that for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the owner of Diego Pelser told me
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, I was just wondering who's going
to buy the Canagar, but someone had to fly
[SPEAKER_01]: in a jet to make a statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny too to see when you were
originally moving into the licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: market, via your social media,
you were sharing with people like,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right, we're moving from medical to
502.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, they like my stuff here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you started posting images of sales
receipts, and you're like, damn,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who's following is like,
yeah, and shared in the astonishment that
[SPEAKER_00]: people wanted that premium product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in retrospect, it's not really all
that surprising, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just really amazed by all the
attention that I've been getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the attention and the help that I've
been getting with this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, especially like magazines
and websites have been asking for
[SPEAKER_01]: interviews with me, or they just place my
product in their magazine for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, you have to pay for something
like that, which I'm very appreciative for
[SPEAKER_01]: because they see the image that I'm trying
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not just trying to have my product out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to change the stigma of
cannabis, and that's what they see.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this luxury market, it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's something that companies
that are trying to do things the right
[SPEAKER_00]: way, naturally will attract marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heck, even from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You certainly didn't pay to be on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to you because I'm a fan,
and when you make fans, everybody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you to their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that says a lot about the efforts
you went into to source quality organic
[SPEAKER_00]: material, get the best rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that you're even hiring your
friends and families is really cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep that loyalty close at home,
and I think it sets a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being on the show today,
Ariel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been really interesting,
and hopefully it'll inspire some other
[SPEAKER_00]: folks to do businesses in their own area
that is just as righteous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, lots of success to you and Lira
Kanegars.
