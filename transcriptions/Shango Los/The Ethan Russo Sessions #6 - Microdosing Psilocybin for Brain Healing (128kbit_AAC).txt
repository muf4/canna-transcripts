[SPEAKER_00]: So, Ethan, we've been hearing recently
more and more talk from researchers
[SPEAKER_00]: recommending and talking about the healthy
benefits of psilocybin from hallucinogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms on the healing and rebuilding of
neural networks after things like a
[SPEAKER_00]: traumatic brain injury or a severe trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, most of the crossover
media, they're just saying psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms, isn't that crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kind of, you know, handle it at
that level of superficiality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But folks often ask me, what is going on
in the brain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at the cellular level, what does the
psilocybin do that helps heal or regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: or expand the neural network?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you break that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a neurologist, I figure this is right
up your alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I've been delving into
this area for decades, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact is, at the end of 2018,
we still don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The conventional answer is that psilocybin
and related tryptamine psychedelic drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: work on the serotonin 2A receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that is not an adequate
explanation for the effects that we see
[SPEAKER_01]: with these drugs, because they're other
drugs that work on the receptor that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any similar kind of activity,
particularly the kinds of prolonged
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits that we're seeing now in
controlled clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Psilocybin has produced great benefit in
end-of-life issues for people with
[SPEAKER_01]: terminal illness, particularly cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, it's shown long-term
benefits on treatment of intractable
[SPEAKER_01]: depression, where even things like
electroconvulsive therapy or shock therapy
[SPEAKER_01]: have been unsuccessful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's with full psychedelic doses of
these agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a phenomenon now that's become
quite popular in our society of using very
[SPEAKER_01]: low doses of subtherapeutic doses of
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's called microdosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be a dose that doesn't
produce strong alterations in
[SPEAKER_01]: consciousness, but has led to people
feeling like they have greater levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: insight, greater levels of creativity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a lot of proof of this,
but we have hundreds of anecdotes that
[SPEAKER_01]: support this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are enough clinical trials underway
now with positive results that support the
[SPEAKER_01]: idea that in the not-too-distant future,
another schedule one drug, psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be an approved pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a great deal to be learned
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 50s, before psychedelics were
outlawed, there had been a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic research, both with psilocybin
and with LSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a manner analogous to what happened
to cannabis, all the biomedical research
[SPEAKER_01]: stopped in the 60s when they were
outlawed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen this slowly come around in
the same way that there's been a
[SPEAKER_01]: resurgence in therapeutic cannabis
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interesting times will follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand from your paper that not
only do you hold that using microdosing
[SPEAKER_00]: can help heal and kind of reconfigure the
brain after traumatic brain injury,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that using it in concert with
cannabinoids can actually be better than
[SPEAKER_00]: either of them alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you normally suggest that
cannabinoids would be paired with
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin for maximum benefit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is conjectural.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any studies of the two
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the phenomena that is common with
the psychedelics in high doses is at least
[SPEAKER_01]: a phase of nausea, which is easily
counteracted with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in complex psychiatric conditions,
I could see the potential for combinations
[SPEAKER_01]: of, say, low dose psilocybin in
conjunction with a properly constituted
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis base preparation, preferably
cannabidiol predominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've got to get one over the finish
line of approval and then see more in a
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled setting of what the
combinations might really accomplish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be interesting,
too, because as you said, we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually know what the psilocybin is doing
in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got pretty good ideas, but the
research has been quashed, but hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be coming back now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we both know that self-healers and
psychonauts are going to be going down
[SPEAKER_00]: this path alone before the science catches
up, since the science has been held back
[SPEAKER_00]: by regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you offer any cautions to people who
want to pursue this kind of solution on
[SPEAKER_00]: their own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Considering neither mushrooms or cannabis
are dangerous, but you might have some
[SPEAKER_00]: cautions around dosing, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd emphasize that this should be done in
the right environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set and setting are critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody should engage in using a
psychedelic unless they're feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonably secure, are in a safe and calm
environment, and absolutely in the
[SPEAKER_01]: presence of a responsible person who's not
engaged in the same activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, a guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else is overtly dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The danger of any psychedelic is that
someone is going to produce a panic
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can be really, really traumatic,
so I would never downplay that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of direct toxicity,
no, but certainly psychotrauma is
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best advice is to proceed with
extreme caution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much better to use too little than
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a person exceeds the threshold of what
they can handle, they're going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: bad experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to last some hours,
and it's not going to be remembered.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, they have to engage in judicious
dosage in a proper setting with very good
[SPEAKER_01]: supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use the term microdosing,
what are you actually talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people usually talk about dosing
in the regular citizens' street,
[SPEAKER_00]: the non-science environment, by weight,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know whether or not you're getting
your psilocybin from cubensis or
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanescens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got different potency themselves,
so you can't just approach mushrooms by
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody had an idea, though,
of how much active ingredient was in their
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms, how much are you looking for to
be a microdose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a threshold dose for a psychedelic
experience with psilocybin is about 20
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams, and this can vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something well under 10 milligrams is
going to represent a microdose,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it could be much lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you mentioned, if someone's doing
this directly with mushrooms, it depends
[SPEAKER_01]: on their potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things written about the
expected potency of specific species,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they vary a great deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be 1% or less psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cubensis, it could be as much as 4%,
and psilocybin is a resins.
[SPEAKER_01]: But without knowing what species you have
or anything else, I would always have
[SPEAKER_01]: people, if they're going to get on this
path at all, and let's emphasize that
[SPEAKER_01]: these agents are still schedule one
illegal in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they're going to go down that path,
they should always err on the side of too
[SPEAKER_01]: little rather than too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go start low and go slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the same adage that we use in
relation to cannabis dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to hear more about this,
there's a link in the first comment to the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast episode that Dr. Roos and I did
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
