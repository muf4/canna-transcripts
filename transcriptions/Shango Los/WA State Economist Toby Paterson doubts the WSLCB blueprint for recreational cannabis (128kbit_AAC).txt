[SPEAKER_02]: I might get fired for saying all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is Shango from the Shaping Fire
podcast and I got a good one here for you
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the Washington Cannabis Summit a
couple weeks ago and they had an economic
[SPEAKER_00]: policy panel that focused on how legal
cannabis is impacting the state as a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the people on the panel was
Toby Patterson and he is a senior forecast
[SPEAKER_00]: analyst for the Washington State Office of
Financial Management.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that he is the guy with the
crystal ball who works for the governor
[SPEAKER_00]: and gives advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Toby was not consulted when the
Washington cannabis market was set up and
[SPEAKER_00]: he just goes off during his time to speak
on the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not toe the state's normal
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: He trashes the original BoTech numbers
that the entire state regulatory structure
[SPEAKER_00]: was based on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to explain why the present
assumptions are wrong as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does it with this, you know,
wry sense of humor that is really rare in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I don't know why this guy
isn't running the LCB.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is super sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I took the video I took of the
panel and I focused in right on Toby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little grainy, but, you know,
I just cut out everything else since we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to focus on what he has to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I pulled out all the snips with
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of like a highlights reel
of Toby Patterson at the Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Summit from the Cannabis
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check this guy out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Toby Patterson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a research economist in the office of
financial management in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm one of the three economists that
support the governor's policy staff and
[SPEAKER_02]: other bits of piece like the legislators.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work for the USDA National Agricultural
Statistics Services before I came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to Washington, I grew up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was in the other Washington sweating
in time as a statistician, counting
[SPEAKER_02]: chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my job is a research economist with,
well, that family is pretty fun,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it leads me in all sorts of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to thank Laura for inviting me
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also want to note the people here
are like really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I went to the LCB to provide
economic guidance on how to institute a
[SPEAKER_02]: working market, I indicated that the
market should define itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, the number of consumers was
unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quantity demanded was some unknown
number as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And further, the number of producers and
the volume produced was unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommended the notion that the number
of producers and retailers would
[SPEAKER_02]: equilibrate as the market matures and thus
the number of licenses should not have a
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make that note.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several of the LCB constituents at the
table vehemently disagreed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, hey, I'm a capitalist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the LCB hired an anti-cannabis drug
policy person to guide their economic
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my mind, I was saying, look,
a working market for cannabis and a
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable expectation of the public is a
market where consumers can buy a high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality cannabis product that is uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis is pesticide free and price
fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in essence, an orderly, stable market
that is safe, free of antitrust,
[SPEAKER_02]: and protects consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not recovered from the 1936
propaganda film reprimand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: The potential trade deal marketplace of
farmers and buyers is instead a convoluted
[SPEAKER_02]: password of entrepreneurs eager to create
a capitalist market and crotchety men
[SPEAKER_02]: regulating based on archaic mythology and
overreaching illogically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a bit of a cynic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an economist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that always
intrigues me about market failure is
[SPEAKER_02]: asymmetric information.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might remember the cigarette industry
used to say that cigarettes are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought, OK, I'm going to look at
this from purely like, what do we have
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is provided to the public to know
about this industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just poked around and said,
OK, well, the LCB is tasked with providing
[SPEAKER_02]: some sort of education material on
marijuana, cannabis, free fruit,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I looked and I said, OK,
well, I picked one subject fairly random.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I pressed on the link and it said,
science-based information for the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, OK, well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's produced or presented by the
University of Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to both UW and WSU, so I had no
affiliation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the alcohol and drug abuse
institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says scientists think that cannabis
causes problems remembering problems with
[SPEAKER_02]: grades and negatively affects learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed, huh, there's no citations
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says science-based right at the
top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get a hold of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, hey, you claim science-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, where are the citations?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so they replied back,
well, it was this one professor that used
[SPEAKER_02]: to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just, because he wanted a nice
write-up that was easy for the public to
[SPEAKER_02]: read.
[SPEAKER_02]: And digest, he just summarized it right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, OK, well, that it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, the person pointed me to the
National Academy of Science, current
[SPEAKER_02]: release, maybe somebody who's seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a 178-page order.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had already read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, OK, well, that contradicts
everything that your website says.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this education?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they never reply.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the purpose of the asymmetric
information in this game?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's winning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are the allegiances still there to
this prohibition mindset?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the purpose?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that I wonder about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I look at all sorts of markets for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the LCB adopted the same prohibition
strategy as they use for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same number of retail stores exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they got the 233 stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Costco's stolen.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, we need something, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making fire for Sam's.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's enforcement of enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the long history of prohibition has
wide cultural implications.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have heard marijuana is a very
dangerous drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet this hypothesis is profoundly
unproven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And reality is not an impressive support
of the assertion that cannabis is at all
[SPEAKER_02]: dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Though the only thing I will say that
cannabis is dangerous is enforcement,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many people have you ever seen die
from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how many people have been arrested?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens next?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can just see.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will note that in Washington,
the latest estimates are there are about
[SPEAKER_02]: 11,000 direct employment jobs in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Though the wage rate is somewhere in the
mid $13 an hour range.
[SPEAKER_02]: So seemingly, I was kind of shocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that low.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is the black market still there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I leave you with that sort of ambiguous
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But beyond that, what's really the
economic cost of prohibition?
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind's eyes, why are we in this sort
of lockstep of it's not it's not a free
[SPEAKER_02]: market at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the small microcosm of a few
licenses which are given a maximum number
[SPEAKER_02]: for what reason I don't I cannot figure
out Todd, you mentioned you had shared
[SPEAKER_01]: your report to the LCB at the meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But did you share your report on the store
cap for your thoughts or what you shared
[SPEAKER_01]: with us on the store cap?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a follow up to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't mind, if you can provide your
thoughts on how to expand access without
[SPEAKER_01]: diluting the market share of pre existing
retail licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there, I talked to the LCB a few
different times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the first instance, that it was
like, at the beginning, and then another
[SPEAKER_02]: instance, it was at the 502 occurrence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think that they,
I think they'd already made it in my head,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak, whether I said whatever I
said, which I, again, I'm for a more free,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, I'm for the free market per se,
but I carefully use that term.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, you know, I was pressing them to
let the market expand as it should.
[SPEAKER_02]: In an unfettered type of way, where
commerce to the market can come and
[SPEAKER_02]: leavers lead as they go out of business
and function in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: To guide the retail system, I place the
idea upon like, with entering into a
[SPEAKER_02]: medical perspective, that if you look at
like how many places can you buy aspirin,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say that the retail establishments
should be diluted that much, but there's
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously a demand for medical products
that, in my mind's eye, should be more
[SPEAKER_02]: accessible than to go to one of the few
stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I recently did a book at how far
anyone in the state had to drive to get to
[SPEAKER_02]: a, you know, how many people were within
20 miles of a cannabis establishment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't published that data yet,
but I will put that out at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working with the demographics team and all
of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that the market, in my mind's
eye, should be a lot bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is a lot bigger than we're
seeing, and there's a lot of smoke and
[SPEAKER_02]: mirrors going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, was there another part of your
question that was totally avoided?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I guess I wasn't specific enough,
and if you don't mind me shouting it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at a cab of stores, and you
specifically said that cab is,
[SPEAKER_01]: in other words, BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, how do we adjust from here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We already have licensees going,
you know, we have the other issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we need access.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we implement that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have an idea on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think, you know, in my mind,
it should be population-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should just be population-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seemed to me that it was quite
simple that you look at, you just have to
[SPEAKER_02]: have some proxy of what the demand looks
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do it, like, how many bars there
are?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the alcohol and the marijuana,
in my mind's eye, aren't even similar in
[SPEAKER_02]: any, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you enter medical, then it's
like, how many stores you have becomes a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I think, you know, we had a bunch
of, I mean, at the time of the 502 Botec
[SPEAKER_02]: study came out, there were 470-something
medical establishments paying taxes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: department of revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: How a study got out that said 333,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: WTF.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to... And how they were
dispersed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and how they were dispersed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of, I don't, that's like...
Canopy sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or something that had to be called,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the retail licenses were,
you know, and then the canopy sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's, you know, again, I would say
that that would be all comers to the
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to try to grow it,
grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live in Washington, also, it's going to be
expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try this in Washington,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this looks like our last question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't touch the mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Primarily, it's both, and with respect to
the notion of access to the product,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been forecasting and estimating the
size of this market since it started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a dynamic emerge above midway through
last year that was independent of the SSB
[SPEAKER_04]: 5052 implementation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it struck me that it appeared as if a
significant number of consumers that had
[SPEAKER_04]: been using the regulated system were
beginning to go elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they're stopping using it
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you look at the transactional
data across time and standardize it
[SPEAKER_04]: against the population characteristics of
the local areas, it's very clear that
[SPEAKER_04]: something happened about midway through,
not last year, the year before,
[SPEAKER_04]: that just started kicking in bad time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, I think this market is
underperforming by about 20%, just on a
[SPEAKER_04]: revenue basis, transactional basis,
largely driven by the lack of retail
[SPEAKER_04]: access.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though there's 556 licenses
allocated, there were fewer than 400
[SPEAKER_04]: stores that sold more than $1,000 of
product last year, over a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And fewer than half of those have a
medical certification for their market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from the government's perspective,
from the governor's perspective,
[SPEAKER_04]: if revenue is important in this state,
particularly when it's a harm reduction
[SPEAKER_04]: strategy, if you're shipping a
recreational land or other use to do this
[SPEAKER_04]: product, why is it acceptable that an
agency of the government can use crap
[SPEAKER_04]: science, which is demonstratively just
ridiculous, false, wrong, to slap on
[SPEAKER_04]: something that basically is, this is how
many liquor stores we used to regulate,
[SPEAKER_04]: so that's how many cannabis stores we're
going to regulate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're staffed for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: To decrease the revenue, and at the same
time, while forcing medical patients and
[SPEAKER_04]: medical providers to either go into the
regulated system or to be criminalized
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves, and then to basically shut off
spigot through regulation and,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, punitive legislation,
in a few instances, so that fewer than 5%
[SPEAKER_04]: of the producers have produced medical
product, less than 1% of the product sold
[SPEAKER_04]: was medical last year, less state sales
tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: And fewer than maybe 1 fifth of the access
points we had at the Green Cross area are
[SPEAKER_04]: currently held to serve patients as
patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a broken system, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can make more money and serve the needs
of the patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think the governor might be
interested in that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Jay is interested in the
marketplace, whether he's down at this
[SPEAKER_02]: fundamental level or the micro level of
this juncture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know because, as I've said before,
actually not here, but the entire amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of revenue to the state is dust and wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: This industry is very small.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, do they care that?
[SPEAKER_02]: They care only as much as the money goes
up, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Aerospace, they really care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tech, they care.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality is that when they started
releasing the licenses, I jokingly did a
[SPEAKER_02]: little calculation and said, well,
in 11 years, they'll actually get to the
[SPEAKER_02]: 233 licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they still aren't there,
but now we can get to 530, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a really weird, I don't
understand what they're doing with that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I will say that it was when Portland
Welfaree made it legal to grow at home,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got on the phone with some producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody, I just called.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of them went, well, I just lost
50 percent of my business that week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, recently, I was down in Portland and
one of the guys I was with came back and
[SPEAKER_02]: he goes, I just got an eight for 17 bucks
and it's some of the best I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, that would have been 56 bucks in
Seattle where he's from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, luckily, nobody's bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in my own personal opinion,
take away whatever my affiliation,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what happened to the medical
industry is totally unethical and immoral.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're here.
You're here.
You're here.
You're here.
You're here.
