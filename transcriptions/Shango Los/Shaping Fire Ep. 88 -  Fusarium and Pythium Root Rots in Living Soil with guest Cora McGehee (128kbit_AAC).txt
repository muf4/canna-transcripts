[SPEAKER_00]: Farming has always been a risky business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interacting with nature is fraught with
potential dangers leading to crop failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, like deer or even spider
mites, you can see and do your best to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some threats, though, are nearly
undetectable and will decimate your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: before you even know it is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about some of
those unseen threats.

[SPEAKER_00]: Today, my guest is Cora McGee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cora McGee is a PhD candidate in plant
science at the University of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her research focuses on the association
between microbial communities and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens causing root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: She holds a degree in horticulture and a
master's in plant science.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we will talk about
fusarium wilt, its causes, and prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second set, we'll do the same
thing with pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in set three, we'll cover proper tool
cleaning, a bit on root rot, in rockwool
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, and the importance of
microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Cora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things that caught me
off guard right away when doing my
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced research on this show about
fusarium and pythium molds is that pythium
[SPEAKER_00]: actually isn't a mold, which caught me off
guard because we certainly talk about it
[SPEAKER_00]: as one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand there's some taxomic
discussion about whether it really is a
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems that they've even created an
entirely new kingdom for it, which for me
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be like a pretty big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you hit on that a bit before we
go into pythium's characteristics that
[SPEAKER_00]: matter to us as cultivators?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's brought up a lot
because we tend to group pythium with all
[SPEAKER_02]: the rest of the fungal diseases because
it's very similar in the way that it grows
[SPEAKER_02]: and evolves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other types of infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the biggest difference is that,
you know, true fungi have chitin in their
[SPEAKER_02]: cell wall and in pythium and different
oomyces is what we categorize pythium in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they lack chitin in their cell wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that's a big difference when
we're talking about characteristics of
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because, yeah, pythium is
not a mold, but we tend to categorize it
[SPEAKER_02]: as a water mold because it thrives in
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It loves water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of an informal way that even
plant pathologists talk about pythium.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you talk about classification,
no, it's not a true fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an oomycete.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can even think of it as it's a
protist.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you grow it in culture,
it still got hyphy and it grows very
[SPEAKER_02]: similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see it, the mold anywhere on a
plant, you know, it really does look like
[SPEAKER_02]: a fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, being being technical when
we talk about it, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're in their own little world and
category of the oomycetes and not the true
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we find that that happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to have them recategorized
taxonomically is kind of common.
[SPEAKER_00]: My only experience with it is,
you know, I kept aquariums for years and
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally we get one of these,
you know, small schooling fish or
[SPEAKER_00]: something where they would change the name
of it from what we knew to a new one
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're like, oh, yeah,
we moved we moved where it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the species chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always thought that was such a,
I don't know, kind of cool and odd thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to have happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you study a lot of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I guess I'll call
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you finding that that these things
like jump around on the chart regularly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny, like most plant
pathologists, you know, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: annoying because we'll call something
their scientific name or Latin name for
[SPEAKER_02]: years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, someone who studies even a
pathologist pathogen, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got the same genus and species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it changes on you, then,
you know, the the correct way is to call
[SPEAKER_02]: it by its proper name, even though,
like, you know, you know, it is the name
[SPEAKER_02]: that you've been calling it for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a really good example of a
pythium that I worked a lot with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, 2014,
the the genus of the pythium changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not even pythium anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it Globus perangium, which is like
a much longer name for pythium irregular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the is the species that I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of being pythium irregular,
it's Globus perangium irregular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a really good example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I attribute it more commonly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more we learn about these organisms,
I think sequencing and molecular
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies have really helped correctly
classify them and keep classifying them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just microorganisms,
tree species and and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even woody ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go through this as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a whole board.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a whole formal process of
people getting together and trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out how to reclassify.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can turn into a headache.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you just go with the flow
and then you accept its new name and and
[SPEAKER_02]: keep going with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can imagine that it it does separate
the old school scientists from the new
[SPEAKER_00]: folks coming up, because some people know
the old name and some people knew the new
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's let's let's us cycle around and
focus on cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there just one species of pythium
that is of concern to cannabis cultivators
[SPEAKER_00]: or or are there a variety of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know there's a lot of different
pythium varieties, but I don't know if all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them are concerned to we cannabis
lovers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, you know, as cannabis is
becoming a way more popular crop and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: still learning a lot about what types of
pythiums that we're finding within
[SPEAKER_02]: infected plants and infected substrates or
soil that people are growing the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my personal experience, I'll start
with, I've personally isolated Pythium
[SPEAKER_02]: myriotylum from infected cannabis plants
and have also extracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was just talking about Pythium
irregular, but it's really Globus
[SPEAKER_02]: varangium irregular.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, they look very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can still think of it as a
Pythium, even though the genus name has
[SPEAKER_02]: changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've identified both of those at a
commercial marijuana facility within
[SPEAKER_02]: infected infected plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, going into the literature,
there's a lot of reports, not just from
[SPEAKER_02]: one state, but multiple states in which
they're finding Pythium affenadermatum
[SPEAKER_02]: within cannabis production, whether it's
marijuana or hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing that, you know, it doesn't
really matter the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cannabis is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, those are the three main Pythiums
that I've been seeing, not just in the
[SPEAKER_02]: literature, but in my own experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of all three of them, Pythium
myriotylum seems to be the most virulent,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means basically causing the most
damage and the most symptoms within the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just mature plants that you
can see these Pythiums in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pythium, you have to actually look for
throughout the whole production stage
[SPEAKER_02]: because Pythium is also known for
attacking really young seedlings as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very susceptible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That classic kind of wilt-damping-off
symptom is pretty classic of Pythium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something to look out for, not just
within mature plants and the soil of those
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, but also within the seedling
production as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does Pythium live in all soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask this question differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, very often cannabis cultivators
are thinking about keeping their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile from these pathogens, which,
you know, since we mostly talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil on this show, of course,
keeping a living soil pot somehow sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of an oxymoron.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people kind of think like,
I don't want any Pythium in my garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm going to guard against having any
Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suspect that Pythium is probably in
every single pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, is we want to keep
our pot in balance so that it doesn't fall
[SPEAKER_00]: out of balance and create a living
environment that lets the Pythium
[SPEAKER_00]: outcompete, I don't know, whoever it
competes against.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is that like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it pretty sure that Pythium's already
present everywhere and it's just about
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping it in check?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a question that I've actually
asked a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, where is it coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now, you know, myself and other
Extension agents and I'm sure pathologists
[SPEAKER_02]: have kind of gotten to the point where now
we tell growers, just imagine that
[SPEAKER_02]: Pythium's always there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be found in lots of different
growing operations, lots of different
[SPEAKER_02]: hosts, and that doesn't exclude cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say, yeah, just keep in mind
that it may always be there, no matter,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you should keep doing your
practices, keeping everything clean and
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to keep everything sanitized.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I always say it really comes down
to not creating conducive conditions for
[SPEAKER_02]: the Pythium to be very happy and,
like you said, really outcompete all those
[SPEAKER_02]: other microorganisms that may be
antagonistic to the Pythium that's in that
[SPEAKER_02]: living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which brings us to the crux of all of
this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the living conditions that create
this opportunity of imbalance and gives
[SPEAKER_00]: Pythium a chance to take over our pot?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the biggest one that I really want to
bring up, and we kind of hinted on it
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, is Pythium loves water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can infect really easily in water and
so waterlogged soil conditions really
[SPEAKER_02]: creates this awesome environment for
Pythium to take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anytime that you're not managing your
soil moisture properly and your soil
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture is too saturated and you're
really waterlogging your soils,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that not only creates,
you know, less oxygen getting to the roots
[SPEAKER_02]: and a really, you know, kind of stressed
out, unhappy root zone within the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's also making this Pythium very happy
because it's got infecting propagols
[SPEAKER_02]: called zoospores.
[SPEAKER_02]: That are very efficient in swimming in
solution and they'll swim right into your
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing that makes Pythium
really happy is high nitrogen levels and
[SPEAKER_02]: excess fertilizer because that can really
break your root cells open and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pythium is very efficient at swimming and
going towards your roots and infecting in
[SPEAKER_02]: that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really want to create a healthy and
happy root zone to stop that Pythium from
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's like always act like the
Pythium is going to be there in the pot
[SPEAKER_02]: with you, but don't allow those conditions
that make Pythium thrive within that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the mechanics of that
really specifically because cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators are an ingenious lot and they
are always looking for their own
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about this mechanic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that you said it was that you
don't want to have too much moisture in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot because the Pythium will swim
towards the roots and infect that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be more to it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I imagine the root actually has
got a membrane of some sort on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the water create an opportunity
for the Pythium to swim into the roots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not just the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the water that too much water is
having an effect on the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So roots also need oxygen to survive just
as we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're not allowing adequate oxygen
to get to the roots and always having too
[SPEAKER_02]: much water bound around those roots,
then you're already kind of creating an
[SPEAKER_02]: effect where you're rotting out your roots
and then that's where Pythium can really
[SPEAKER_02]: take the opportunity to come into the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying like the root is wet and
so the root starts to like literally rot
[SPEAKER_00]: and so there are like fissures in the
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, if that root cell burst open,
it'll start leaking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it leaky roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll start leaking out root exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Zoosports can sense that and swim via
in the root via chemiotaxis can get into
[SPEAKER_02]: the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I also mentioned not just
water log conditions that are not allowing
[SPEAKER_02]: adequate oxygen within the root zone,
but also excess fertilizer can also like
[SPEAKER_02]: high salt concentration within your
growing operation can also really affect
[SPEAKER_02]: those roots, stress them out, break them
open, kind of like cause some root
[SPEAKER_02]: necrosis root damage, especially at the
tip level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then again, you're just allowing this
entry point for the Pythium to get through
[SPEAKER_02]: really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard an explanation for what
I'm thinking we all refer to is root burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people say, oh, you don't want to use
too many ferrets because you'll burn your
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you this is what we're all referring
to when we use that common parlance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess we call it leaky roots because
like they're leaking out those root
[SPEAKER_02]: exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's making, you know, all these plant
pathogens are waking up and being like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh yeah, we have an entryway now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and then once they get into that
tissue, then, you know, they, they really
[SPEAKER_02]: have something to feed on and they start
multiplying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your populations just get higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, you know, they have, now they have a
host.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so they can survive efficiently,
uh, dormant and not need a host,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, within soils and things like that,
but they can really take off and increase
[SPEAKER_02]: the population when they have that host
and those, those tasty roots to feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess if you want to think about it like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really it's not that Pythium,
it's not that Pythium has come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: attacked your plant as much as it is that
the cultivator has overwatered its plant
[SPEAKER_00]: or doesn't have enough drainage for long
enough that the roots are rotting and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the smell of the exudates, if you will,
like wakes up the Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it, it goes into the root via
those, those cracks in the root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the, the Pythium is just going to
sit there and be, um, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say hibernation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, that's not right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just hanging out.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really can't like blame Pythium
really like it's like we're, we're
[SPEAKER_00]: creating this attractive nuisance
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overwatering and overfertilizing like the,
they really, really do not help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really help in, they don't help
the grower, but they help invite the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pythium to infect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the two huge things that the
root rots, um, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pathologists really can't stress enough,
uh, cause you could stay as clean as you
[SPEAKER_02]: want, but you know, those root zone
conditions, you want white plump roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so, so anytime those are compromised,
you, you are kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: alluring all these, uh, especially
Pythium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, diseases to, to come into the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, for both Pythium and
Fusarium, the main way that most
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators recognize that there's a
problem is because they get what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people will call either Fusarium
wilt or Pythium wilt, where the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: droops in a very severe way that looks
unlike a regular wilt when they get
[SPEAKER_00]: thirsty, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this somehow looks more dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and you know, once you've seen it
a couple of times, it's really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't really confuse them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, but is there, are there other
ways that, um, we can find signs to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine if we have Pythium like before
it takes the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there, are there other signs that we
can look for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that's a, that's a good way to,
we always say, you know, scout early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, I'll go back to my previous
statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you want to really start with
inspecting all the healthy material coming
[SPEAKER_02]: and all the material and making sure it's
healthy when it comes into the facility or
[SPEAKER_02]: coming into your yard, what have you,
like wherever you're growing your plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure those are healthy and that
you're not starting off with, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: like any rotted plants and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're talking about like a,
you know, more mature potted plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: what are signs that you can look for,
uh, it'll, it starts in the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so once you get that wilt and that
dramatic droop, like there really isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: going back or saving that plant,
which, which I hate to say, but it's all
[SPEAKER_02]: about prevention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you get to that level of you're
getting the wilt, then, then, then it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: goner.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since it starts in the roots and it,
you'll, you'll start getting kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: brown, uh, necrotic roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first step.
[SPEAKER_02]: And something that's telltale about
Pythium, that's not so much for Fusarium
[SPEAKER_02]: is that with Pythium, it's called a rat
tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can, like, if you see that your
roots are looking kind of necrotic or
[SPEAKER_02]: browning, is it going to put you kind of
like dead, not healthy white roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take some of that root tissue,
pull it apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the outer cortex or just like,
um, the outer membrane, however you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to say it of that root comes off so easily
and exposes that internal, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: that inner vascular tissue within the
root, uh, the inner cortex, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: we call that rat tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty telltale Pythium.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it just easily sloughs off right when
you like break that root apart,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, that's a, that's a good tell that you
have Pythium brura.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully you can catch that before
you start getting the wilt symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then another characteristic sign
is reduced growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a big one because, uh,
you know, say you've got six plants on a
[SPEAKER_02]: table and you're seeing, you know,
they, you want to look for uniformity and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and if there's some plants that are
just looking like really smaller,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, Oh, I bought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: These like around the same time,
uh, things are looking, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: more reduced growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be probably bigger with how
much you've been fertilized and are
[SPEAKER_02]: watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, man, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like they're growing really
slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's another telltale sign that
you've got a root rot issue, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause it's just that plant, its roots are
compromised.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just not growing as vigorously as
it should be if it had white healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then another symptom that you can
see within both, you know, Fusarium and
[SPEAKER_02]: Pythium is yellowing of leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see, uh, we like to call it
chlorosis, chlorotic leaves, yellowing is
[SPEAKER_02]: the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and, and that's a big symptom as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so before you even get to the wilt
stage, cause the wilt's like the final,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the, the roots have been totally
compromised and that, that pathogen just
[SPEAKER_02]: totally took over and, and it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are three big ones to really look
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it starts with the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so you really just want to be
checking, making sure like you have white,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very exciting when you can like,
you know, kind of pull the pot back and
[SPEAKER_02]: see like, yeah, I have white roots,
like, and it's, it's kind of root bound to
[SPEAKER_02]: like they're, you know, they're grown,
there's a lot of them, but when you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing many roots within your root ball,
and when you're seeing that the roots are
[SPEAKER_02]: turning brown, that's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you should maybe bring that plant out
of production, uh, so that your other
[SPEAKER_02]: plants don't get infected as well and that
you're not spreading, um, that infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a, you know, I have heard
that people pull small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I even pull small plants just
because they don't look, they are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to yield enough to justify
their space in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had never really thought about it as
the runts might just not be, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, seeds with phenos that are not
as, um, rambunctious, but they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: could be sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that, you know, making a decision
to get rid of a runt based on yield is,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, is a lot more of a passive
decision than potentially getting rid of a
[SPEAKER_00]: runt because it's a very good sign of,
you know, root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that kind of, that seems like it's way
more pressing than, you know, than just
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and, you know, if you really
don't want to get rid of that runt,
[SPEAKER_02]: like say like, oh, well I could get
something out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, just check those roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like that, that'll tell you really
quick, is my plant happy and healthy and
[SPEAKER_02]: are the roots thriving?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if they're not, then it's a really
good sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, I have root rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's why this plant's not doing
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because not enough water and
nutrients are getting uptaken through
[SPEAKER_02]: these necrotic, you know, these browning
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's com, you know, it's compromising.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it, the plant's really struggling to,
to, to get to high yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the best
practices of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I'm picturing, you know,
looking at my roots, first thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of, uh, a lot of folks
grow in, um, you know, huge cloth pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, have hundreds of gallons and
clearly you're not going to like flip that
[SPEAKER_00]: over in your palm and, and knock out the
plant into your hand so you can look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're, if you're growing in,
in huge pots, that probably, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't for this solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if you're growing in,
um, you know, generally fabric pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't really slide out as elegantly
as they do when you're using a black
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic landscape pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably not for, for,
for, you know, fabric pot people either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing in a plastic pot
that is of a size that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: realistically turn the plant over and,
you know, give it one shot, shake,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it dislodges from the pots and you look
at it, that would seem to be your best
[SPEAKER_00]: case if, if maybe the only case where
checking for that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that I am using, you know,
a five or 10 gallon and it's dried enough
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not going to fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I turn it over and I've, I've got it
cradled in my hand so I don't break the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, um, the stem and I give it a one
quick shake and it slides out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm looking at the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you want to see is really white,
uh, full plump roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't really want to see much
brown, uh, kind of dead looking roots and
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to see a lot of them too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so depending on how old the plant,
you know, what we, what we consider a
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy plug or, um, you know,
a healthy potted plant is you want to see,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, it root bound almost like
not, not too much to where it's unhealthy,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you really want to see those white
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all the way around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I've seen too many times with
pythium root rot is you'll look at that
[SPEAKER_02]: root ball and you barely see any roots
around that, uh, soil media or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, whatever media you're growing
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looks like, you know, and the
roots you do see are brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you'll see like maybe some white
roots, but they're attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, a part of them is brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so it, you know, you should be looking
for a white healthy roots and then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: feel better about like, oh yeah,
like I don't, I don't think there's much
[SPEAKER_02]: of a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, um, you know, I, I'm always for,
for testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's also like a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's especially depending
on how many plants you have and you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to compromise your operation or all
your grow, you know, it doesn't hurt to
[SPEAKER_02]: also get a soil test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and since you're not sending
tissue to these labs and it's pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: inexpensive, uh, you can tell really
quickly, like, yeah, but I'm getting
[SPEAKER_02]: yellowing of my leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, isn't that a symptom of pythium?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, or my plants aren't growing that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can at least, um, kind of when your
checklist or what have you get away with,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have a nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause at least if you send the soil,
you can see, Oh, I have adequate
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh, my pH isn't a good range.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, um, so say, you know, you're
getting the yellowing and it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's deficiency of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, at least you'll know that,
uh, because I'm sure it can be confusing
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have yellowing plants and your
roots are looking really healthy and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, Oh, but what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so, so I feel like that's one good,
that's, that's one tool that you can put
[SPEAKER_02]: in your toolbox for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, just to eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't expect all your growers to
just become plant pathologist overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a little bit of the
stressful part, uh, into where I think
[SPEAKER_02]: research and extension, uh, and services
need to really match the industry and the
[SPEAKER_02]: home growers and the popularity of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, cause we really want to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and a lot of these things,
um, you know, I can name out symptoms,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot of them can span across,
you know, Pythium, Fusarium symptoms look
[SPEAKER_02]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't
expect growers to know the difference
[SPEAKER_02]: between them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, just, just looking at, you know,
even cuttings or mature plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you can definitely get a idea of
like, Oh, is this, is this unhealthy?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wonder if it's disease or I wonder
if it's environmental or nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's the first question
you should be asking yourself truly,
[SPEAKER_02]: not what disease is it, but is it a
disease?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second question, once you've
figured out, Oh, it must like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, or, you know, this is from a
pathogen, these symptoms then,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, what pathogen now?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there is, uh, I do want to
stress like the steps of diagnosis in
[SPEAKER_02]: general, um, when working with any crop,
uh, cause even if you presented me with
[SPEAKER_02]: two plants, one had Fusarium wilt,
one had Pythium wilt, uh, I wouldn't feel
[SPEAKER_02]: confident within my diagnosis or
assessment unless, you know, I was putting
[SPEAKER_02]: those roots under a microscope slide and
like looking at the structures,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, you can even go as far as
molecularly identifying it, which,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, usually isn't, isn't needed for
certain cases, uh, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, like, I don't think growers
should have to bear that responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there should be, um, resources
that can help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as, as we get into better
relationship with the federal government
[SPEAKER_00]: and are able to take advantage of you
know, more, um, you know, resources within
[SPEAKER_00]: the agricultural industry, like extension
agents and stuff, we'll, we'll have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for years, cannabis cultivators
have been pretty much on our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so let's say that we, we do have a
plant and it's already Pythium wilting and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've already clearly established that
once, once the plant has gone full wilt
[SPEAKER_00]: that, uh, that it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, so what do we do to dispose of
this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not thinking I want to take
that plant and, and just throw,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw the substrate back into my compost
pile, uh, and, and take the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the overall amount of Pythium
in my soil supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I probably want to take it away
from my whole property, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bag it, tag it, double bag it,
get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't compost it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you get all the debris.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's why it's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not just, you know, take it out,
but really like bag it, contain it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you don't want that soil
particle going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't, you don't want any of those
infected leaves falling anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, just to be safe, just bag the
whole plant and, uh, and yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: get it, get it out of your growing
operation and do not compost it,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, is, is the best, the best situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if you get a Pythium outbreak or,
you know, a plant that's fully wilted,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't want it to be around the rest of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, the thing that irks me and you'd be
surprised that you see it as, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: someone will have a wilted plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't even matter if it was from
Pythium, but if you have like an infected
[SPEAKER_02]: plant or a plant that's wilted or just any
debris that you're not growing with,
[SPEAKER_02]: or just like some plant that's sitting in
the corner that you're going to deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: later, like deal with it as soon as you
can, because the more that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: dead tissue just sitting or dead debris
sitting near your healthy plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, there's lots of plant pathogens that
like to feed on, uh, dead tissue,
[SPEAKER_02]: decaying organic tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we're going to talk about
Pusarium in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pusarium is, you know, a very efficient
sacrifice and it would love to stick
[SPEAKER_02]: around and hang out on all those wilted
leaves kind of sitting in the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Botrytis is another one, you know,
we start getting to more foliar pathogens
[SPEAKER_02]: that you could really avoid just by
bagging that plant up, getting it out,
[SPEAKER_02]: like deal with it right when it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and, and you know, your past self will
thank a future self.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, uh, my growing mentor, Hector,
um, he would love hearing you say this and
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd feel so justified because uh,
you know, I was brought into this scene
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was meticulous with any time we
were removing, um, leaves from the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to put them in a bag that was then
removed from the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I always found that a
little tedious and time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I got into the regenerative
growing, um, scene, I felt like a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: vindicated because so many, um,
regenerative growers will remove leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: off the plant and then, uh, put them on
top of the container down at the soil near
[SPEAKER_00]: the base of the stem so that, um,
the, that leaf can degrade and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the idea is that the nutrition
goes back into the soil as well as making
[SPEAKER_00]: home for, you know, little, you know,
small organisms that live on the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what, but what you're explaining to me
is that this is absolutely increasing risk
[SPEAKER_00]: of pathogens without a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you know, I, I've got to applaud
like the person who wants to take,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, be sustainable and not want to
waste like tissue, but there is a place
[SPEAKER_02]: for that tissue and it's in a compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a compost that's going to be like
treated and away from your healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you take any type of debris and put
it, you know, especially like in a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: moist place, like on top of the,
uh, soil where your healthy plants
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, you know, I could imagine,
I could honestly already see the botrytis
[SPEAKER_02]: or like diseases like coming for that
tissue, like within, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of days, like it, it really
doesn't take long for another issue to
[SPEAKER_02]: occur, uh, for, for when you have any
plant debris at any type of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter, even soil that's hit your floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, that's where cleaning
really comes in as a good proper
[SPEAKER_02]: preventative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so not just getting rid of the plant
debris, getting rid of soil debris and
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that can just kind of hang out
around your healthy plants, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause, um, you know, not only like
insects, but lots of, uh, lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens, will hang out there,
stay dormant until, you know, until
[SPEAKER_00]: they're given an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until they, you know, that little piece
ends up on your shoe and then that shoe
[SPEAKER_02]: goes trudging in your side garden and you
know, like, so it's, it's just better to
[SPEAKER_02]: sweep, get all that stuff out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's just, yeah, it's the best,
best, uh, procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back when we come back,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to do this same thing again,
but with Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is plant pathologist Cora
[SPEAKER_00]: Magee.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 20 years, Humboldt seed company has
been family owned and providing reliable,
[SPEAKER_00]: high yielding seeds originating in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the current trend is to slap one
super male into a line of hype strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt seed company continues to breed
with precision and care by doing large
[SPEAKER_00]: sifts and back crosses to emphasize the
absolute best traits that a line has to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of breeding takes time,
talent and space to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what kind of aroma you are
particularly into, Humboldt seed will
[SPEAKER_00]: likely have something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you love fruit, you can choose from
banana, mango, apricot, papaya,
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry, blood orange, melon and lemons
across their various strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all gas, glue and classic sour
diesel lines as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are the heritage
California strains like OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack hair and headband and their award
winning blueberry muffin is one that
[SPEAKER_00]: delights just about everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt seed company is proud to bring to
market the infamous freak show cultivar 2,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has a great THC high, but looks so
much like a fern that some folks can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even identify it as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant that really needs to be seen
to be believed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for well balanced CBD
seeds, Humboldt seed company can turn you
[SPEAKER_00]: on to CBD strains that actually have
flavor like the dill and pepper terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: of Willie G's leather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you are looking for regular,
feminized or auto flowers, Humboldt seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company has the gear to make this your
best growing cycle ever.

[SPEAKER_00]: their gorgeous flowers and the
extraordinary freak show plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt seed company, let them know
Shango sent ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a replacement for using peat
[SPEAKER_00]: moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_00]: container growing, but organic growers
know that peat moss is an unsustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: resource and the mining of peat bogs
destroys habitat and releases sequestered
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there's finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that shares the
[SPEAKER_00]: same benefits while also being
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems, it actually is made from
upcycled organic paper and tree bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption and water conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully and locally sourced,
peat moss is the result of decades long
[SPEAKER_00]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss has the fluffy nature of peat
moss and handles exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like peat moss, peat moss is inert,
so it won't change your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available in a range of preparations,
including a nutrient enhanced blend,
[SPEAKER_00]: a coco coir blend, and also as an organic
soil conditioner with no added nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss is also available as an animal
bedding.

[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses everywhere are striving to
reach people through advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know though, that trying to reach a
cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service or brand
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that really lets people know what
sets your company apart from others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold people who own companies need to know
that getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable and help
[SPEAKER_00]: our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz
bang smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately and
[SPEAKER_00]: with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot well, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: During these pandemic days, conventions
and cannabis events are pretty poorly
[SPEAKER_00]: attended, but podcast listening is
skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a commercial on Shaping Fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_00]: of their headphones right now and will
continue to reach new listeners as they
[SPEAKER_00]: explore the Shaping Fire back catalog of
episodes again and again for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spot on Shaping Fire costs less than a
printed postcard per person and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire audience is full of smart
cannabis enthusiasts, cultivators and
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs who are always curious to
learn.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los and my guest
today is plant pathologist Cora McGee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are essentially going to do second
set like we did with first set where first
[SPEAKER_00]: set we were focusing on Pythium,
the non-mold, root mold, but now we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about an actual mold which
is called Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I would say that Fusarium is
probably more commonly known in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because pretty much anything that wilts we
say, oh, it's got Fusarium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet you that a good share of the
plants that actually die from Pythium when
[SPEAKER_00]: the story gets retold later that night
over beers, that Pythium is actually being
[SPEAKER_00]: sold as Fusarium because Fusarium wilt
looks an awful lot if not exactly like
[SPEAKER_00]: Pythium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there multiple Fusarium species that
cannabis cultivators run into problems
[SPEAKER_00]: with or is it really only just one?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some main ones that researchers
and pathologists have been identifying
[SPEAKER_02]: down to the species level within more
commercial greenhouses, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it stays true to gardeners as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Fusarium oxysporum, that is a really
common Fusarium that a lot of people have
[SPEAKER_02]: started seeing in cannabis, including
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Fusarium oxysporum is a Fusarium wilt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It causes Fusarium wilt and it's pretty
common.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty common Fusarium across all
host species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we weren't too surprised when,
you know, started realizing cannabis was
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptible to this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another Fusarium that causes more of a
root rot is Fusarium solani.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't personally seen this in
cannabis, but Dr. Punja, he's a
[SPEAKER_02]: pathologist in Canada who's been
surveying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like he hits a, he comes out with a
new paper every like six months with all
[SPEAKER_02]: different pathogens that he finds in
commercial marijuana facilities as well
[SPEAKER_02]: from, you know, soil to hydroponics,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems that Fusarium oxysporum and
Fusarium solani are the two biggest that
[SPEAKER_02]: he finds in abundance within these
facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's mostly the roots, the root
rots, the crown rots and the wilts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny, you know, Fusarium
oxysporum can be found in mature plants
[SPEAKER_02]: causing the wilt, but I've also
encountered it within cutting production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the younger tissue stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to say real quick,
Fusarium doesn't just affect roots or
[SPEAKER_02]: cause wilt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium can also be a fungus that attacks
the buds of the cannabis plants as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just like you were saying, you know,
it sounds like Fusarium is getting a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of the credit where Pythium may be
involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the same goes for the Fusarium
that a few researchers, not just myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I saw Cornell has seen this as well
within cannabis buds is Fusarium is
[SPEAKER_02]: detected on that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure when growers see mold growing
on the bud, they immediately are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's a common one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen botrytis on the buds as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just, I just wanted to let your
listeners know, you know, again,
[SPEAKER_02]: just going back to where testing is really
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could also be caused by Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some, some differences
between them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you know, you'd, it would
really help if you had diagnostic tools or
[SPEAKER_02]: if you had a pathologist that that could
help identify it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not expecting, you know, home growers
or even some commercial growers to really
[SPEAKER_02]: tell the difference with that mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it looks, it looks similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does Fusarium on the buds look like
botrytis or will it present differently?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to say because it depends
who's looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I were to look at it from afar,
probably couldn't tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you start getting more up close,
like botrytis is, you know, it's called
[SPEAKER_02]: gray mold because the, the knidia and the
spores, the actual way you see the mold
[SPEAKER_02]: fuzzy part on your plants, it has kind of
like a grayish color to it for botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the way botrytis grows,
it grows in like chains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so that's something that I would know
and that I would try to look for when
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I've seen Fusarium grow on bud,
it has more of a white color and has more
[SPEAKER_02]: of like a white thread like growth versus
like spores and chains, which botrytis,
[SPEAKER_02]: which botrytis kind of that, that is
characteristic to botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I would say, yes, to me,
I saw a difference, but to tell you the
[SPEAKER_02]: truth, when I first saw Fusarium on the
bud, I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Oh, well maybe it's botrytis
because I really haven't seen any reports
[SPEAKER_02]: of Fusarium on the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that'd be kind of crazy
because you do want to really look out for
[SPEAKER_02]: that because Fusarium head blight on corn
is, you know, some species are known for
[SPEAKER_02]: producing mycotoxins and those can be,
you know, harmful toxins if humans ingest
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so, and so it's, it, again,
it's not something you should just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: forget about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you really want to get a good
diagnost, diagnostic take on, on what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking at within that bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, going back to the story,
when I was looking at that bud,
[SPEAKER_02]: right when I put it under the microscope
though, I mean, it, it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the structures are very different between
botrytis and Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I immediately was like, Whoa,
I have a Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went further and I not only
looked at the Fusarium under the
[SPEAKER_02]: microscope that I saw in the cannabis bud,
I put it in culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I say I put it in culture,
there's a nutrient media that you can put
[SPEAKER_02]: in Petri dishes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's how we can grow out
different pathogens to really see
[SPEAKER_02]: morphological characteristics in culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can help identify.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Fusariums in culture are well known for
creating vibrant colorful pigments,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you put botrytis in culture,
you're going to see those kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: gray, gray spores in the Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll also go on if it sits
longer in the culture, it'll create
[SPEAKER_02]: sclerotinia, which are their resting
structures that can survive and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, substrates and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They almost look like tiny mustard seeds,
almost like black little rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what their structures look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Fusarium can create these gorgeous,
well, I say gorgeous, but very like
[SPEAKER_02]: vibrant colors and pigments in culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Fusarium oxysporum, as we were saying,
which is common in cannabis, that can
[SPEAKER_02]: create in culture a very pretty kind of
purple lavender color in culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Fusarium that I picked up on the
bud had this very striking kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: orangish red color in culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I actually had that Fusarium
sequenced.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could tell I was like very curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, OK, I'm also going to
sequence it so I can, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just morphologically identify it,
but I also want to molecularly identify
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, like, you know, Fusarium structures
can live look very similar, depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, oh, I wonder like what
species this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was more of a curiosity thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we had it sequenced, it turned
out to be Fusarium sporotrichoides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's also been known as a Fusarium
head blight on like wheat and more cereal
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a long story to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Fusarium is not just seen within the
roots, it can be within the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just one example of a personal
story of how I've diagnosed to species
[SPEAKER_02]: level one on the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think just as more pathologists get
their hands on these different pathogens,
[SPEAKER_02]: different production sites, like maybe
more reports will come out to see how
[SPEAKER_02]: common that is, because that's something I
can't really speak to is, was that a rare
[SPEAKER_02]: occurrence?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in our research facility at UConn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, is that is that a common
common pathogen we see?
[SPEAKER_02]: I read something Cornell has seen similar
things on outdoor hemp production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually they went as far as they
saw that some Fusariums they saw on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis buds did produce mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And something that the cannabis industry
should keep its eyes and ears out for,
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling so schooled and humbled at the
moment, because I here on Vashon Island,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I live, you know, I help a lot of
patients with their grows, because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a local expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been experiencing what I now
think is Fusarium all over the island the
[SPEAKER_00]: last two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, as I saw it, I'm like,
wow, this Botrytis is really presenting
[SPEAKER_00]: differently this year, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which now, in retrospect, that sounds so,
so novice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, your your explanation of it
was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, we would see Botrytis,
which is, you know, the gray spores,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they kind of look like, you know,
little gray clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then about two years ago, we started
getting these, you know, these white
[SPEAKER_00]: strands that you describe, that to me kind
of looked like, like white cotton strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my head, I'm like, oh, it's like a
spider mite got in here and did all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these white, you know, webbing instead of
the kind of webbing they do on the crown,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, they're all these,
like, straight webbings of white and
[SPEAKER_00]: cottoniness inside the flower,
which is clearly a mold, and clearly not
[SPEAKER_00]: something I want to smoke, but also wasn't
something that I had seen a lot of before
[SPEAKER_00]: last year, which is interesting,
because the weather here for the last two
[SPEAKER_00]: years has been significantly wetter and
colder earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting that you would say
that all of these what are essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful colors come out when you put it
in the Petri dish, because the main way
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are identifying what I now will
call Fusarium in the buds, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're on the inside of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flower will look great more
normally until you crack it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, god, what's all this
cottony stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all white.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the telltale sign, which, you know,
if you know your garden well, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: from across the greenhouse, is that there
will often be a part of the bud that has
[SPEAKER_00]: gone incredibly colorfully necrotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be like one leaf that will go
like bright maroon or purple or pink or
[SPEAKER_00]: orange or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, look at this
fantastic, gorgeous bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's that one, there's that one
sugar leaf on there that has gone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, royal purple or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you crack that bud open,
suddenly you see all of these cottony
[SPEAKER_00]: white strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, have you had that experience with the
sugar leaf turning colors on the bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: And second, what causes the change in the
color?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we say, you know, in the garden is
like, oh, you know, all the anthocyanins
[SPEAKER_00]: are showing, right, which would suggest
that the chlorophyll has left the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I don't know, that could all be
bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm hoping you understand my example
enough that you can just kind of generally
[SPEAKER_00]: speak to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so in my experience, I did not see
any different coloration around where I
[SPEAKER_02]: had saw the Fusarium bud rot on the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I caught it pretty early too,
because I didn't see a lot of dead tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: around the signs of the pathogen on the
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then two, so I haven't had a lot of
experience with the bud rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure I'm not sure what
produces the increase in pigments within
[SPEAKER_02]: the tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting because at UConn,
since about 2018, 2019, we have multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: researchers, like looking at these types
of interactions and seeing like how did
[SPEAKER_02]: different pathogens that are infecting
these plants, like affecting pigmentation,
[SPEAKER_02]: how is it infecting genes?
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it infecting trichomes?
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are all questions that I can't
answer, but hopefully are starting to get
answered.
[SPEAKER_02]: As research has been opened up for this
crop, because that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of this crop we couldn't touch
for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the answer to that question may be
answered within other crops, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: sure if it's been answered within
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be a very interesting
research question, because that could
[SPEAKER_02]: really be applicable to growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that could be maybe an early
sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been seeing like a different
pigmentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something that Fusarium is
causing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it seems to be a late sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we see that color,
it is time to either remove the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or or just the crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, you use this term crown rot
earlier in the show, which I had not heard
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sounds like the perfect phrase
for what we've experienced these last two
[SPEAKER_00]: years where we've got this beautiful plant
with this killer cola and the cola gets
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium, and then it shows one sugar leaf
that changes color and we crack it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got advanced cottoning,
you know, these cotton, white cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: strands on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, calling it crown rot,
that's a pretty cool name for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would call that bud rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I mentioned crown rot earlier,
crown has to do with the crown by the root
[SPEAKER_02]: zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you meant the top of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it is totally easily
misunderstood because when you talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: crown rot, it's more at the base of the
plant, so the crown of the root,
[SPEAKER_02]: which Fusariums can cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are Fusarium crown rots out
there, such as like Fusarium salani,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure has been reported as one.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when we're talking about the bud
rot, pathologists wouldn't call it crown.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd call it bud rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bud, like a bud rot, because it's on the
bud of that, you know, part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to clarify that for- No,
that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good clarification.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So circling back around to like the main
thrust questions, Fusarium, is it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil all the time, just like Pythium is,
and it is also just looking for an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to take over?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, unfortunately, yeah, it's a
soil-borne pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to imagine it can be around,
especially, you know, you're growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: these living soils and there's lots of
nice microbes in there and you don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to create conditions that are conducive
for the Fusarium to increase in population
[SPEAKER_02]: and then cause infection and get into your
roots and then get into your stems
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, Fusariums can also
cause vascular issues, vascular stem rots
[SPEAKER_02]: and wilts within your plants as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, you know, everything I said
earlier about not to do within your pots
[SPEAKER_02]: to avoid Pythium is very similar with
Fusariums, such as you don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: overwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to damage those roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to have, you want to have
optimum nitrogen for your plants because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cannabis are heavy, heavy-
Feeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they're heavy feeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't want to have too much
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to have too much compost on
your plants because it can really,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, like we talked about, create those
leaky roots and create a really
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunistic time for that Fusarium to
infect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the symptoms are really similar as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, Fusariums, since I said it,
it can cause vascular wilts and basically
[SPEAKER_02]: like within the stem is what I mean when I
say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can sometimes see discoloration in the
vascular tissue and even sometimes on the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom of that stem, you can sometimes see
like a discoloration of a brownish or
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes like a reddish brownish color at
that bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you wanted to sacrifice
the plant, if you're really having a
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling like, oh, this plant is looking
sick, its roots look compromised,
[SPEAKER_02]: what have you, if you cut open that stem
and you kind of see this hollow or a
[SPEAKER_02]: discoloration within your stem tissue,
then that's a, that's a good telltale
[SPEAKER_02]: sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I may, I may have Fusarium within my
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that, you know, if,
if, if the Fusarium is in my soil on a
[SPEAKER_00]: day-to-day basis, and would it be fair to
say that it is dormant, like we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about the Pythium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be dormant and then we make it
wet, which, which, you know, causes it to
[SPEAKER_00]: get active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we keep it wet, which means that
it's starting to thrive in a anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the roots are rotting and
creating opportunity for it to get inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like, like anywhere along this line,
this plant isn't coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by the time we see the wilt,
I'm guessing we're in the same situation
[SPEAKER_00]: we were with the Pythium, where,
what did you say, bag it and tag it and
[SPEAKER_00]: get it off the property?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's so sad sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like one thing if you're,
if you're scaled, right, and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 plants, but for, you know,
since I don't do a lot with scaled
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, and I'm more focused on,
on smaller patient gardens, like sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be, you know, one plant can be,
you know, 20% of somebody's entire grow
[SPEAKER_00]: during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, there's so much resistance to
just throwing away the plant instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to revive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so the longer that plant stays in your
garden, the higher the pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathogenetic load to your garden,
the more likely that those pathogens will
[SPEAKER_00]: hop over to another plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, there is, if you have less
plants, hopefully you can try to optimize
[SPEAKER_02]: their root zone and their health,
like as, as closely as you can to avoid
[SPEAKER_02]: this, this occurring in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I know your listeners are
really into the microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_02]: the beneficials within the living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, if, if you have a really
good, micro organism buffer, I should say
[SPEAKER_02]: within your soil, like hopefully that's
another preventative defense that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, can, can be good to have into
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it really is like, do not over,
please try not to over fertilize and over
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause yeah, that can, you know,
eventually be a death sentence to a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and it, and it is very sad because
there's no corrective control measures,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's all organic and,
and so it's all a preventative game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I know we've been talking about
that, but that, that really is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cleaning and just making sure
those conditions are really good for the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to avoid it from coming in,
in the first place and taking over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to think about the
mechanics of that, that death spiral and
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if your microorganisms and the
other, you know, living folks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere are actually one of your
defenses against Pythium and Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first thing you do is you pour all
this water in there and, or maybe you,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's the right amount of water,
but you have terrible drainage,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reason you've got really damp
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that's going to do is
create an overly water environment that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to wipe out a whole bunch of your
microorganisms that are supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: part of your defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you're creating this
low oxygen and environment that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: rot your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like essentially it just leaves
the field of play open for a big old
[SPEAKER_00]: Pythium party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we understand the living conditions
and that this is all a preventative game
[SPEAKER_00]: and that, you know, once we've gotten to
the point that we actually see the wilt,
[SPEAKER_00]: like don't even try, just like get,
you know, bag it, tag it, and get it off
[SPEAKER_00]: the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I want to take all of this and put
it on its head before we, before we leave
[SPEAKER_00]: this second set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, you know, sometimes you gotta
try to save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the example that I want to
give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an impossibility,
but, but I want us to like kind of work it
[SPEAKER_00]: out anyway, because I know that there's
people, including me, who grow this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's imagine you've got a four foot
by eight foot raised bed that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, let's just say it's like 18 or
22 inches deep, and you're going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole point is that you're going
to be, you know, growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have living soil and
companion plants, and you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple cannabis plants in one bed so
that, you know, all of their roots can
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to each other and they can share
nutrition and information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just this big, sexy regenerative
success until one of the root zones gets
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium or Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly you see like, let's say one
of your six plants in this bed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you come in in the morning and it is
wilted and you know it's not water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else looks good, but this one
plant is totally screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the idea to bag it and
pitch it is great in theory, except for
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that it's in this shared bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that, you know, as the
cultivator, you really don't want to cull
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire bed because, you know,
if you've done it right, you've got,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, tons of rocks in the bottom and
then silt and sand, and you're like
[SPEAKER_00]: building your layers of substrate up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just this beautiful thing that
took all this effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you've got this, you know,
essentially this like out of control
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen that's in the root zone of one
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we needed to try to, at least try to
save the bed, what would your radical
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription be for trying to extricate
that one plant and revive the bed so that
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps it doesn't spread to the rest of
the bed?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this might be really unpopular what I'm
about to say, so I apologize in advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: To all the growers who don't want to gut
the rest of the plants that were sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really important, first off,
to make sure that that diagnosis is a
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to make sure that you have
Fusarium in the bed in the first place
[SPEAKER_02]: before you make these really dramatic
calls, but say it's like, oh, like I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it is, I don't want to risk it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would do is at first, of course,
take the plant that was showing symptoms,
[SPEAKER_02]: wilt or what have you, get it out of the
bed, bag it, get it out of your operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also, I would get rid of the rest
of the plants in that bed too,
[SPEAKER_02]: because really you're just creating a
happy habitat for that Fusarium to now go
[SPEAKER_02]: to those roots and feed on those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you've had a plant
already wilt in that same bed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you probably have pretty high populations
of that Fusarium already in that bed now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't want to increase that
population even more and make it even
[SPEAKER_02]: harder down the road to be growing in that
high raised bed or what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would get rid of all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the plants, say you've got six plants
in the bay, one went down, get rid of all
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at least you may have like
moderate populations of the Fusarium
[SPEAKER_02]: because it hasn't had time to really feed
on all six.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you just have like a crazy amount
of Fusarium structures and infecting
[SPEAKER_02]: agents within that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's two things that come to mind
once you've gotten rid of all the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're just left with this bed
with, again, like you said, all these
[SPEAKER_02]: layers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've really been, you know, adding to my
soil and making it healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two things I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to guarantee it'll work,
but you could at least try and see if it
[SPEAKER_02]: could eliminate if you want to keep
growing in this bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one I would say is that you could try
to cook the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so when I say try to like cook the
soil, I'm saying try to create an
[SPEAKER_02]: environment where you're going to you're
going to try to get a lot of temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: get the temperatures really high within
that bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can hopefully kill those infecting
propagables and those structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a way to do this is you can get some
plastic, some some clear plastic so the
[SPEAKER_02]: sun can penetrate through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to really seal it around in
that bed, like make sure there's no air
[SPEAKER_02]: pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really want to get that clear plastic
on top of that soil layer, put a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: brichter around it, what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really helps when it's a hot summer
day as well, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you do it right, you can get
temperatures up to like 120 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: Fahrenheit that can really help penetrate
and kill some of those infecting
[SPEAKER_02]: propagables within that bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, just depending on how bad the
populations are, it may be effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another option which I've heard
other extension agents talk about this
[SPEAKER_02]: within cannabis is, you know, crop
rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know you really want to put cannabis
back in that bay really badly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's where you grow your
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but since you know that there's
Fusarium right now and it's compromised,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you don't want to gut the bed out,
you don't want to waste all that good
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could try to plant another crop that
season in that bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've heard hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like see it as kind of like a
weed, but it has a really pretty purple
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, kind of pea like leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's called hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually shown that if you use it
as a crop within fields where watermelon
[SPEAKER_02]: get Fusarium, it's shown to show
suppression of Fusarium within within that
[SPEAKER_02]: field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so you could try something like that,
putting another crop that is either can
[SPEAKER_02]: help suppress the Fusarium over time or
that just isn't cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can really you're really just
trying to decrease those populations now
[SPEAKER_02]: in that soil so that you can eventually
put cannabis back in it and feel more
[SPEAKER_02]: confident.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're not going to have another
outbreak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a pretty like novel idea
using a plant for kind of using it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really was expecting you to talk more
like when you when you did that apology at
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning, I really thought you were
going to go into like antifungal drench or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, which isn't what
isn't which isn't really how you went with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any you know, organic or Omni
Omni Omni certified fungicides that you
[SPEAKER_00]: think might solve this issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, granted, this is this is like a
nuclear option, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's also probably going to take
down your mycelium networks and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, this is not what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people do all sorts of radical things
when they've got an infest or you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: an infected bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I figure it's worth asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so there's there's a few there's
there's actually quite a bit of biological
[SPEAKER_02]: fungicides that are out there that you can
I'm pretty sure you can now use within
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's there's three that come to my
mind that are more efficient towards
[SPEAKER_02]: fusarium and and they're all biological
fungicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a good way to think of it as good
microbes versus your bad microbes,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is your fusarium is the bad microbe
and the good microbes that I have in mind
[SPEAKER_02]: are pseudomonas species in biological
fungicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can just look it'll say active
ingredient when you read the label.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's if it's a pseudomonas strand
and if it's labeled for fusarium diseases,
[SPEAKER_02]: then that's that's a good contender that
you could use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one that's really popular that
I've used because it's really efficient
[SPEAKER_02]: within suppressing pythium is Root Shield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a trichoderma, which is a
beneficial fungi that can mycoparasitize
[SPEAKER_02]: other bad fungi or my seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and that and bacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bacillus is a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a pseudomonas, the one that I said
earlier, those are both beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: bacterias.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of products such as
triathlon.
[SPEAKER_02]: B.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: is a bio fungicide that comes to mind with
bacillus in it and and companion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think they just came out with a new
formula like companion Max.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these would all be good formulations
that you could use that are organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're OMRI certified, like you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could you could like try to try to
put those in the bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just depends how high those
fusarium populations are to see how
[SPEAKER_02]: effective those biological fungicides will
be on helping colonize that fusarium
[SPEAKER_02]: that's in the bed and prey upon it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like that's another another good
solution that you could you could try out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the three that come to my
mind that are that have been pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient towards fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then after you use them as a
nuclear option, you're going to be left
[SPEAKER_00]: with a bed that's like out of bounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have to spend some
time, you know, like rebuilding the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, which is why, you know,
it is considered a nuclear option where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just trying to, you know,
save maybe not save the living part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but just not have to replace the
soil and the silt and the sand and the
[SPEAKER_00]: rocks and and like start over with a clean
slate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're like maybe you can maybe you
can save your inputs, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to rebuild the biology after you use
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think it's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we see it as, oh, if we add
these products, they'll be so dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we'll just have like bacillus in the
bed or we'll just have pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we need as researchers to
really look into what will happen when we
[SPEAKER_02]: just add these products to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, we're talking about like
outdoor beds, even if they're indoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, you know, you got silt,
you got rocks, you have you have soil that
[SPEAKER_02]: you had there previously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm I'm not so sure if adding these
biological products would totally
[SPEAKER_02]: dominate, you know, this microorganism
community in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If if anything, you know, I would
hypothesize that adding them may recruit
[SPEAKER_02]: other different organisms to make up in
the bed and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think we underestimate how complex
these microorganism communities are within
[SPEAKER_02]: all these different living situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that would be like a really
interesting thing to study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, if I have a bed that had
high populations in Fusarium, if I added a
[SPEAKER_02]: biofungicide, how does that reduce the
populations and how does that change the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial makeup of that bed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all these are very like unanswered
questions that hopefully in the next five,
[SPEAKER_02]: ten years with all these researchers now
getting grants to study cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: like something that will have more answers
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's that's something I just I
just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was dooming about the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, you know,
let's trust the microbes, which is usually
[SPEAKER_00]: my answer for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to take another short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is plant pathologist Cora
[SPEAKER_00]: McGee.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options and who to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_00]: ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend HEMBRA genetics collection to my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and listeners who are looking for
a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HEMBRA, spelled H-E-M-B-R-A.
[SPEAKER_00]: HEMBRA is not just another seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: HEMBRA is a woman operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.

Gnome Automatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money but have no
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited HEMBRA to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_00]: about them from my friends.

[SPEAKER_00]: That's HEMBRA genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out dynomyco.com

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is plant pathologist Cora Magee.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so Cora, we have already talked
a lot about prevention, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially don't let your soil be too wet
because all hell breaks loose when the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a couple times you have mentioned not
causing the pythium and fusarium to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: By, you know, keeping things clean,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And while, how do I want to say this?
[SPEAKER_00]: While lip service is given to,
oh, you know, wiping down your scissors or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever in, you know, the cannabis
cultivation scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to admit to myself, I don't even
know if I'm cleaning my tools right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just clean my tools the way that
my mentor taught me to clean my tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I didn't learn that anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What tools should we be keeping clean and
how do we clean those tools properly?
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pruners and shears and things like
that, things that you use to prune or take
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings, those definitely need to be
sanitized and you can sanitize those by,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have isopropyl alcohol,
some people spray down their tools and
[SPEAKER_02]: wipe them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying anything's wrong with that,
but personally, I would fully submerge the
[SPEAKER_02]: tools in the isopropyl alcohol just to
make sure you're getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's covering all the surface area and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not missing anything when you just
spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be one thing I would
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can also use a solution of
10% bleach to also clean your tools,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is pretty effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I would give a contact time to
sit in that 10% bleach before you use them
[SPEAKER_02]: for all your plants for, you know,
about five to 10 minutes to really make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that it's getting any infecting
propicals that may be on those tools
[SPEAKER_02]: really, you know, give you security that
they should be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say the contact time,
do you mean that the bleach solution
[SPEAKER_00]: should be, like it should be soaking in
the bleach solution for 10 minutes or are
[SPEAKER_00]: you saying that don't put it on your
plants for 10 minutes after you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question to clarify.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying you want to let your tools sit
in the 10% bleach solution for about five
[SPEAKER_02]: to 10 minutes and then you can just wipe
them off and use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you do want to make sure that within
the 10% bleach solution that the contact
[SPEAKER_02]: time is enough to where the cleaning
solution is actually doing its job for the
[SPEAKER_02]: tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that 10 minutes also work for using
the isopropyl or ethanol solution?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So speaking from, I know not a growing
side, but in the laboratory, when I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: doing anything like very sterile,
or if I'm putting isolates into long-term
[SPEAKER_02]: storage, you know, I do let my scalpels
and my metal tools sit in alcohol for at
[SPEAKER_02]: least 10 minutes just to be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll flame them.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I understand that I haven't seen
this a lot within growing operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know definitely the contact time for the
10% bleach is very important, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, my preference, I would say I'd want
to fully at least submerge them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't think that it's necessary for
that 10 minute contact time with the
[SPEAKER_02]: isopropyl alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get really specific because,
you know, I am usually using either
[SPEAKER_00]: isopropyl alcohol or ethanol because as a
cannabis enthusiast, these are things I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of in my life around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally I would have a washcloth that
has got some isopropyl or ethanol on it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will simply wipe the scissors on the
four blade sides and just call it good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am thinking at this point that that's
not enough contact time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not just that, but you're not
truly like, so if you're just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: wiping the blades of the scissors like
that, the scissors may have other parts of
[SPEAKER_02]: it that haven't gotten exposed to the
alcohol that now you're clipping and it
[SPEAKER_02]: could be a source of contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to totally eliminate that,
in my opinion, I think spraying can be
[SPEAKER_02]: effective, but also submerging the tools
and the alcohol can also be effective just
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that you're covering all
parts of the tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to think of the best
practice for this because putting all of
[SPEAKER_00]: my tools into a bath at the end of the day
and walking away and even leaving them
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight, like that sounds like easy
squeezy, but I'm also using those scissors
[SPEAKER_00]: on multiple plants during the day and I'm
pretty sure you're going to tell me that
[SPEAKER_00]: there should be some amount of cleaning
before I go plant to plant because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how I spread infection, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you, especially if you've been
having issues with disease in the past and
[SPEAKER_02]: you just like want to be very sure I know
within the apple and pear industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: they, I mean, they plant to plant,
I mean, five minutes soaking between plant
[SPEAKER_02]: to plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it, it's pretty serious within that
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you could also take a page out of
what other crop producers or other,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, pretty much other crop producers do
and other growers do by, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could have multiple shears and a jar
of ethanol and, you know, kind of rotate
[SPEAKER_02]: them out as you go plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not waiting forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a pretty good best
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like one thing that we cannabis
growers have are lots of fricking
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, because we go through them and,
and, you know, we're all trimming at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I probably got 17 pear,
you know, the, the hardest part would just
[SPEAKER_00]: be finding them all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but I like the idea of if I'm good,
if I'm going down the row and trimming all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants of everything that's
necrotic or unnecessary or big leafing or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, to, to have like, you know,
six or seven pairs in a bath and just work
[SPEAKER_00]: my way down the line and use a pair of
scissors and put them in the back and then
[SPEAKER_00]: grab the next pair for the next plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time I get to the first pair
again, they will well have been,
[SPEAKER_00]: have the contact time that they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, better to be safe than
sorry too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might seem like overkill,
but you know, if you're not getting
[SPEAKER_02]: disease, then at least, you know,
it's a good pat on the back where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Oh, well, it might seem really
excessive, but I really don't want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause then once I have it, there's no way
to control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that that's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To anybody who is scaled for sure,
because you've got a lot of room for loss,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then also anybody who's not scaled
because like the example earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've only got five plants,
one of the benefits is that you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: slow and you can scout every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you can, you know,
do, do soaks like this because every plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is precious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether every plant is precious or
you've got a lot to lose from sheer
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers, it really does sound like a best
practice for anybody who's actually just a
[SPEAKER_00]: conscientious grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would also say, you know,
it doesn't just stop with pruners and
[SPEAKER_02]: shears.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could also, if you're reusing a bunch
of pots, like even spraying down those
[SPEAKER_02]: pots and getting all the loose soil out
and just really starting clean with,
[SPEAKER_02]: with, with everything that you're using
within the production is also a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: good idea as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you mean like spray down the pots
with like isopropyl?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you could do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% bleach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them, but make sure you let them dry
before, you know, you put soil in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like just another way,
you know, I'm sure you re-use like
[SPEAKER_02]: seedling trays or I'm sure that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all don't do stuff from seedling,
but you know, where you put your cuttings
[SPEAKER_02]: or just any type of plastics is a good way
to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, pots and things like that,
that you keep reusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That also, it does not hurt to,
uh, to get, you know, empty them out,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of, kind of brush them out,
get all that, uh, like any, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, roots that may have been in
there, get them out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any like old soil, uh, you could even do a
dip within the 10% bleach, let them dry
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once they're dry, they're ready
to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got clean pots that you can
reuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's a good, a good, um, sanitation
procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so I'd like you to speak briefly
to the other cross contamination that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've just kind of alluded to a couple
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to give you just a couple
of data points and then just kind of let
[SPEAKER_00]: you run with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that, um, um, you know,
you mentioned how the, you can get an
[SPEAKER_00]: infection from pot to pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would like to know what the
mechanism for that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you mentioned, you know,
stuff getting on your shoes and the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it sounds like we need to be
careful with pot to pot prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, you know, litter,
maybe, maybe we're even using a 10% bleach
[SPEAKER_00]: solution on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so kind of speak to that if you would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so it's, it's easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say you're growing kind of more in an
indoor facility, it can be a little easier
[SPEAKER_02]: to sanitize surfaces as you will with,
um, you know, 10% bleach or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how big the operation,
a lot of commercial growers will use
[SPEAKER_02]: Xeritol or Sanidate, some of these
oxidizers that can really cyst open and
[SPEAKER_02]: kill infecting propagules, um,
really efficient on surfaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so, so that's one and you don't want
like excessive splashing going on
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and yeah, if you have debris on your
floor, again, like you really want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: rid of all that plant debris, that soil
debris, root debris that may fall out from
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that you've harvested and you're
trying to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, cause yeah, those, you know,
we talked about earlier how these
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens can survive and, you know,
decaying tissue and soil, uh, and just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of stay dormant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so it, it's easy to spread that around
when it's just kind of sitting on the
[SPEAKER_02]: floor, sitting on your bench and it's not,
and it's just sitting there and not
[SPEAKER_02]: getting swept up, taken care of,
putting in the trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, even after you sweep up,
it's a good practice to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even sanitize those floors, sanitize those
benches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if you have a canopy, you know,
like cleaning that canopy, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: off every now and then, uh, can,
can really help, again, like your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your whole goal is to lower the
contamination is to lower these pathogen
[SPEAKER_02]: populations within your growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did, what did you specifically mean
by splashing?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of, that word seems kind of
out of context.
[SPEAKER_02]: So splashing, there's multiple ways you
can splash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people, uh, within cannabis
industry that I've personally seen,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's for everyone,
uh, does, a lot of hand irrigation.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so within other crop, um, production
at a higher scale, it's a lot of drip
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation to avoid the splashing that I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, cause say, say I have a bunch of
debris or I've got debris somewhere and
[SPEAKER_02]: now, you know, I'm, I'm splashing
everywhere and the water's getting on the
[SPEAKER_02]: floor and it's, you know, you don't want
anything to splash into your, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: your healthy, like, you know,
uncontaminated soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, from a potential contamination source.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, with boots,
like you can get things on your boots and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're walking around in the water
and then, you know, say you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I really want to stress is
you don't want to go trudging around in,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, say you've got a section where you
have more mature plants, older plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and there's a lot of soil and you
know, you're working within that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you're irrigating,
your boots are all muddy, what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go into your cutting or you
know, younger tissue seedling bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really want to make sure that that
stays really clean because those young,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, cannabis plants are a lot more
susceptible to these diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like even at, you know, a lower
population, they could, they could be
[SPEAKER_02]: compromised and get an infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you want to be careful of how
you're even contaminating, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, bay to bay or, uh, or,
you know, um, garden to garden,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, bringing any soil and really
bringing contaminants with you in
[SPEAKER_02]: different sections, uh, wherever you're
growing as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so it's something to really keep in
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and even like cleaning your boots off,
you know, that's a, you get into the habit
[SPEAKER_02]: of it, spraying them down after each day
and, and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so guilty of that splashing from a
hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had not even ever considered that
because I am one of those people that hand
[SPEAKER_00]: waters from a hose with a water wand on
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just go plant to plant and you know,
so long as the soil isn't hydrophobic,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will almost immediately soak into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a moment there that it does
kind of collect on the top and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm doing, you know, using the rain
setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's all these micro splashes
and it's probably aerosolizing all sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff from the top of the pot that is,
you know, very likely going to be spread
[SPEAKER_00]: to the nearby plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so before we move on from like
cleaning stuff, is there, is there
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that I have missed that,
that, uh, I should ask?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think we've covered a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you always want to inspect your new
plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, you know, the lung,
the youngest plant materials, super
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptible to these diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I know you, you know, if you take
cuttings from mother plants, you always
[SPEAKER_02]: want to inspect that mother plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know within commercial facilities,
they don't, they don't want to keep a
[SPEAKER_02]: mother plant for more than two months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they always want to be starting with,
uh, really clean plants because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it really starts in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to start with healthy plants and
end with healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and yeah, just make sure you get
all that debris off the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not, you know, bringing
contaminants from one field to another
[SPEAKER_02]: field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, you're properly sanitizing
your tools and, uh, all the equipment that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're using to grow again, just as
another safety net as that prevention
[SPEAKER_02]: umbrella we've been talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so sort of really help your,
your grow to be the most successful you
[SPEAKER_02]: can.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all on the same team.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all just want the plants to be,
uh, as happy and as, as, uh, healthy as
[SPEAKER_02]: they can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just putting these things into place,
it, it seems like a pain, but it always
[SPEAKER_02]: pays off when you don't have disease
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so it's all good practices to keep in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now see, that is such a great summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now would be a great time for me to
like wrap up this show and thank you and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, but there's one more question
that I want to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when you and I were first on the phone
and talking about whether or not we
[SPEAKER_00]: thought this was going to be, uh,
an episode we wanted to do together,
[SPEAKER_00]: you said something in passing that
totally, you know, got my attention and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted to ask you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you were talking about your
research there at University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut and you were all excited
because you said, that you had just killed
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole greenhouse of cannabis for
research and you were all excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, would you tell us the story?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like why, why did you kill an entire
greenhouse of cannabis and why were you
[SPEAKER_00]: thrilled about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a total like, if there's like any
plant pathologist listening, they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, yeah, it's like, we only feel that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, when we see sick plants,
we like get really excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I want to give a little context.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at UConn, I, I predominantly study,
uh, root pathogens within leafy greens or
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's what I focus on.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, since the doors have really
opened for cannabis and not a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people have been working on it,
we had gone to a commercial facility in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2019 and they had symptomatic plants with
the same symptoms that we've just covered
[SPEAKER_02]: in this show, reduced growth, yellow
tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: They even had one plant that fully wilted
that they bagged and was like trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and at UConn at any research facility,
we can't take the tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wasn't allowed to actually take the
roots and take, uh, any of the infecting
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took it because these are cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not leafy greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go to a commercial cannabis
facility.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for clearing that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so we had gone to a cannabis facility
cause they're, you know, having some
[SPEAKER_02]: issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just checking it out and we ended up
taking the, they were growing mature
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plants and coconut core.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so we had taken the coconut core
surrounding the roots of all the
[SPEAKER_02]: symptomatic plants, brought them back to
the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, we had actually ended up getting
26, uh, organisms, uh, it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did serial dilution plating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people can get like more,
but we had collected from a good bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within that, uh, fast word.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had identified them morphologically
and molecularly, we got 21 of those
[SPEAKER_02]: isolates were pythium meriotylem,
the one that I spoke about earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's very, the cause is very severe,
uh, symptoms within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've seen that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then three were this globosporangium
irregular that was formally the pythium
[SPEAKER_02]: irregular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one was a fusarium oxysporum that
we actually got from, uh, a cutting,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, in rockwool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so fast forward, we've got these
isolates and as a plant pathologist in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to actually publish and be confident
about our findings that these organisms
[SPEAKER_02]: were the ones that were causing the
symptoms within these plants, we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: do what's called Koch's postulates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to isolate those organisms and
then we have to re-infect the same crop
[SPEAKER_02]: with those isolates, uh, separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can see the effect of each one of
these isolates, uh, one, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to see, uh, if they cause disease
and the they caused a lot of disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I've been working with root
pathogens for about six years now,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I, I really haven't seen this type of
virulence or severity within, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: within seed lanes, uh, as much as I have
with cannabis, uh, when I had introduced
[SPEAKER_02]: these pythiums that I had gotten from the
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, just to kind of wrap it up,
we had a whole greenhouse with a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plants and they were,
uh, I had inoculated them at two weeks old
[SPEAKER_02]: after I'd grown them from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so they were pretty young and,
and they were growing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'd inoculate them, uh,
how tall were they?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say, I want to say they grew to
about a foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are about foot, uh, kind of young
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got about a thousand of them and
all of the 21 pythium mariotylum isolates
[SPEAKER_02]: that we had gotten from that facility that
we introduced back onto healthy,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, we couldn't do marijuana plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, all of them went down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, chlorosis, they all wilted,
uh, only, you know, uh, some as soon as a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of days after that pythium was
introduced to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so it really showed, wow, yes,
these, these pythiums that we got from the
[SPEAKER_02]: facility, um, are very pathogenic
pathogenetic, uh, to cannabis and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and caused high virulence or high severity
when we put them back on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then as you know, as a scientist,
it's like, okay, so now, now we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to report it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you can't just take a
disease from a plant and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, it causes disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have to, like I said,
uh, yes, you have to prove you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I didn't just randomly get this
organism to prove that it can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: cause symptoms and infection when the
plant that you got it from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I guess it was very exciting
because like I said, I, I, cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: very susceptible to pythium and that just
kind of opened our eyes to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: wow, like research really, you know,
it's exciting because I'm sure there's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be a lot more research projects
and opportunities coming up to help these
[SPEAKER_02]: growers and help everyone, uh,
really not only identify, but help control
[SPEAKER_02]: and the things you're talking about and
understanding more about it, because it
[SPEAKER_02]: seems, uh, you know, I always,
I work with poinsettias a lot too within
[SPEAKER_02]: our lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do some with ornamental growers and
poinsettias like really susceptible to
[SPEAKER_02]: pythium as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, if you talk to any growers
who grow poinsettias, it's a big
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogenetic pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look out for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, who, like cannabis is the next
poinsettia when it comes to pythium
[SPEAKER_02]: because, uh, cause pythium is pretty
severe on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate you sharing that story
and you know, uh, you know, props to
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Connecticut for doing
whatever legal like hoops they had the
[SPEAKER_00]: jump through in order to be able to do,
you know, uh, cannabis research,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's hemp or type one is,
is, you know, it doesn't matter because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just nice to know that we've got
university ag departments working on our
[SPEAKER_00]: side now and that, and that people like
you are doing that kind of work and
[SPEAKER_00]: killing thousands of plants so that we can
all the rest of us learn best practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so shout out to University of
Connecticut for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I, so I guess in, in,
in wrapping up, thank you also to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cora, for, for joining me here on shaping
fire and sharing your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've, um, since you work with
us on a daily basis in a university
[SPEAKER_00]: setting and you know, you're getting ready
to defend your own PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's really nice to have somebody who
has got such specific examples and easily
[SPEAKER_00]: accessed metaphors and knowledge where you
can go right to the point instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: dancing around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for coming on the
show and, uh, and sharing your expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been very fun and you've been also
awesome shango and just, it's been a
[SPEAKER_02]: pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn more about,
uh, different molds and how they involve
[SPEAKER_00]: with the cannabis plant, I recommend that
you go back and check out episode 28 of
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping fire, which is all about botrytis
and powdery mildew in scientific detail
[SPEAKER_00]: with, uh, Kevin McKiernan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that is a bit more of a genetic
approach than this show was, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: more about, uh, usability and best
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, oh my goodness, you will know a
lot more about botrytis and powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: after that show, uh, from a genetic level
and best practices to, uh, to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and if you have enjoyed,
uh, Cora and you want to keep up with her
[SPEAKER_00]: and her exploits in the lab, um,
you can follow Cora, uh, on her Instagram
