[SPEAKER_01]: The more we learn as students of living
soil, the more we uncover what we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know and desire to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We move from simple concepts to harder
ones, always building a bigger picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: the world for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: During Shaping Fire episode 79 with Joey
Berger on creating soil amendments and
[SPEAKER_01]: natural pesticides from local plants,
I stumbled into a gap of my own
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding right there during the
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey was explaining the challenges to
using aerated compost teas on compacted,
[SPEAKER_01]: low oxygen dirt, and I realized that I
really didn't have a good context for what
[SPEAKER_01]: he was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I learn on every Shaping Fire
episode, but in that moment, I realized
[SPEAKER_01]: that while I use aerated tea and could
discuss aerated versus anaerobic inputs on
[SPEAKER_01]: a convention panel, that I really didn't
have it solid in my head from a
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative perspective, how to use it as
a regenerative tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I laughed it off during the show and kept
going like I'm supposed to as a host,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when the show was over, I immediately
got on the phone and called up my buddy,
[SPEAKER_01]: soil scientist Layton Morrison,
and interrogated him for an hour and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half on aerobic and anaerobic inputs and
their uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of that conversation,
I realized how useful and entertaining
[SPEAKER_01]: this information really is, and I figured
you might get off on it too.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, geologist and living soil scientist
Layton Morrison returns to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Layton has joined us before for episode 59
on water and watering, and also for
[SPEAKER_01]: episode 54 on geology and biomimicry in
living soil cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Layton is a lifelong enthusiast of both
aquaponics and living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: His obsession with biosphere, too,
led him to set up aquaponics experiments
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Rodale Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Layton has worked with world-redowned soil
biologist, Dr. Elaine Ingham, blending his
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaculture insights with traditional
compost and compost tea strategies to
[SPEAKER_01]: prove that natural farming techniques can
replace modern synthetic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Layton is currently founder of Kingdom
Aquaponics and co-host of the Living Soil
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversation Show on Future Cannabis
Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Layton is a sought-after speaker and past
co-founder of the Science of Organic
[SPEAKER_01]: Regenerative Cannabis Cultivation
Conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're gonna talk about aerobic and
anaerobic living soil environments and how
[SPEAKER_01]: to effectively use each to build your
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Layton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's great to be back, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a pleasure to chop it up with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabulous, fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get right into it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the discussion of the day is aerobic
versus anaerobic growing environments for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of cheesy to start off a
discussion with a definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to it, anaerobic and
aerobic environments are just at the
[SPEAKER_01]: fringe of the science that a lot of
cannabis folks know.
[SPEAKER_01]: For natural farmers and for serious
experience cultivators, the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing around aerobic and anaerobic as
terms is something that they do every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most consumers and probably a lot of
everybody else is not going to be as
[SPEAKER_01]: readily comfortable with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you define the difference between
aerobic and anaerobic growing
[SPEAKER_01]: environments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, Shango, it'd be my honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anaerobic means void of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be zero parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And aerobic, to the best of our scientific
explanation at this point, would be eight
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million or greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is a top end of that,
which is problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get to 12 to 15 parts per million
of oxygen in an aquatic environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll actually start doing damage to
fish, their eyeballs, their slime,
[SPEAKER_00]: the biofilm on their scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is definitely a top end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll give you a quick short story.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was down at Rodale working under
Elaine, she had a brewer that she was
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated with, wasn't getting to work
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she asked me to take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I basically said, well, your air pump
is undersized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're having problems growing
out these organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made me start to think like,
oh man, what if I brewed with pure oxygen?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a tank of oxygen and I figured
out a way to cool it because, or warm it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't subject the water or the
organisms to ice cold liquid oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started brewing with oxygen and I
killed everything very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a fun little fact that yeah,
there is a point of too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to find this particular balance
where our tiger our target microbes can
[SPEAKER_01]: most survive or most thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This eight parts per million threshold,
where does that come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: With most things in science, it's not
usually just like put somewhere randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does something happen at more or less than
eight parts per million of oxygen that
[SPEAKER_01]: allows some process or disallows some
process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that the threshold point?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it probably comes from larger
organisms, not microbes, so fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've been studying animals and
mammals and fish for a long time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there was some
realization that you would not get certain
[SPEAKER_00]: species of fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm staying in the aquatic
environment for right now that could live
[SPEAKER_00]: in lower than eight parts per million in
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like trout or temperature
sensitive fish for the most part would not
[SPEAKER_00]: do well in less than eight parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's kind of where that
boundary got set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting because if you look
at swamps where you have stagnant water
[SPEAKER_00]: and low levels of oxygen, you end up with
more reptiles, turtles, snails,
[SPEAKER_00]: salamanders, snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I think that science decided
that at eight points or eight parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million was the sweet spot for definition
of aerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, my next question was going
to be like, do we consider aerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: environments to be living and anaerobic
environments to be dead?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that I had a little bit of
problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That definition, because I'm pretty sure
that the rice paddies, well, where they
[SPEAKER_01]: grow rice, are anaerobic environments,
and yet they look healthy and they grow
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you just named another anaerobic
environment a wetland that I hadn't
[SPEAKER_01]: considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can be teeming with life,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so would you give some examples of
anaerobic and aerobic environments so that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can kind of picture them in my head?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I honestly, the only thing that I
pictured as an anaerobic environment was
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, you know, a sludgy pool of
water in some city concrete with filth,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm getting over this idea that
anaerobic does not mean unalive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just might mean off-putting to the
human palate and nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of this stems from the
soil food web camp and the natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally try my best to make
everybody realize that it's all life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't care where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the definition of a ferment
is basically the use of a biological
[SPEAKER_00]: process with zero oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still biology in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure we'll go down that rabbit
hole deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's some things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero oxygen, ice cold, no atmosphere,
no gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet the tardigraha can live in outer
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they most recently harvested some
bacteria off the outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: International Space Station in a test that
they'd started about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that biology was still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a extreme environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's even more extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottom of the seafloor under incredible
pressure that would just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: compact a submarine off of these volcanic
vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got super hot, super cold,
no light, no oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet you have organisms growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be another prime example of an
atmosphere or a condition or environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was void of everything that we think
of as alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the obvious one is, you know,
the other end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm going to stay in aquatic
environments because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're breathing air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the examples are a little easier in
aquatic environments too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also shout out to the tardigrade,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Water bear has got to love him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm part of the fan base.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me ask this in a different way
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I, so my first time coming
across a anaerobic ferment was one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends here on Vashon, Trevor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the first person, actually he's the
first person for me to really be aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: trying natural farming here on the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had these five gallon buckets that
were, you know, filled halfway with
[SPEAKER_01]: invasive plant material from his property
and the rest with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he had some aquarium bubblers in
a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he had most of them that were
just, in my eyes, just rotting in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they smelled really, well,
I could be nice and say pungent,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they smelled like crap, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like how they smelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were off putting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I couldn't believe that he was
going to put this stuff in his plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But his plants always looked really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a very talented cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wonder myself now, if it's
inaccurate for me to say anaerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: environments are dead, they are just maybe
the ones that I don't prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible that it's just because as a
human, I'm a species that is oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: loving, that I am naturally discouraged or
pushed away from anaerobic environments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they are environments,
like it's an whole ecosystem that I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want less of that and more aerobic
because that's the kinds of thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps me alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any, does it make any sense to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually touched on something in the
last little comment about your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So humans have a natural defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called their nose, the nose nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wouldn't eat something that would
make us sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so therefore we're naturally turned
off or retch or remove ourselves from
[SPEAKER_00]: places that do not smell aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a primordial defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, even in a ferment, even in an
environment with zero oxygen, it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still biology that lives there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, again, not something that we
would typically want to stick our hands
[SPEAKER_00]: in, put our nose near, drink or eat
because of that primordial defense
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism of, you know, don't play with
this because it smells funny or smells
[SPEAKER_00]: bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that has made me, I mean,
like I'm realizing it right now that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that this has made me prejudiced
against anaerobic fermentations and inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: in general because they smell bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in my head, I'm like, oh,
they smell bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's death.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to pour death on my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bro science of the worst kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I love the way you said dead because
let's face it, when life leaves the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: animal plant or human, generally there's
not a very nice smell for a period of time
[SPEAKER_00]: until the complete decaying process or
fermentation is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when I first crash landed
back here in March 4th, two days before
[SPEAKER_00]: the shutdown, 2020, I was, you know,
looking around going, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: this place, you know, Oxnard is amazing,
you know, Ventura County, look at all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the lockdown hit and I really didn't
have anything to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my jobs dried up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole world was reeling as to what
this meant and what was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I decided I was going to,
you know, at least continue my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I decided I was going to make a
compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem was I didn't have any
inoculant, nor did I have any fish frass
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the pile going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was I collected greens and
browns, scrounged them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, diversity, diversity is much
different browns, many different greens,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I could clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I poured them, I put them in a
cylinder made out of six by six wire and
[SPEAKER_00]: some insect screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wet them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to the beach and I
collected some kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you know, as many diverse types
as I could find, threw it in a five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: compound bucket and sat it in the sun for
five days and watched it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it started to foam, I whipped out
my microscope and took a look at it and
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, bam, look at the life in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had just turned to a funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't smell putrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't smell like poop, but it didn't
smell like it did when I first collected
[SPEAKER_00]: it, when it was not anaerobic and it
smelled fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it was something in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I poured that on my compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within two weeks, it was some amazing
organisms growing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our thought of that something bad means
automatically is dead, is incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's still a lot of life
there, as we've just discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's, you know, a primordial
instinct to reject something that does not
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like something we want to consume,
but that doesn't mean that it's dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so if we now understand the
difference between aerobic and anaerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: environments and we get the idea that,
you know, generally one is not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: better than the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just different expressions of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are talking about our favorite
plant, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so will you kind of like bring this on
home and talk about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the nature of the cannabis plant
in that we, as cannabis cultivators,
[SPEAKER_01]: are trying to create aerobic environments
because that's where our cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: thrives?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's reel it back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were the original land races coming
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were coming from the jungle in India,
and they were coming from mountaintops in
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan and Pakistan with no moisture,
and the other was coming from extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the interesting thing about,
perhaps, let's go right to the Amazon,
[SPEAKER_00]: the jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone's ever been there, they'll know
exactly what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just such a weird place where
everything is rotting around you so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the soil is just teeming with death
and life, and the air is crisp with
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're living in a place where,
in the soil, everything is going through
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be an anaerobic environment
or an anaerobic digester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the absolute opposite is happening in
Pakistan and Afghanistan, where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: zero humidity and very little rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant has proven many different
things to many different people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but her ability to live in an environment
that is so hostile, it's not funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not even talking about Rudy Alice,
and that's another one, but each in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis family.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it triggers its own flowering because
it doesn't get the light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's why I think that so
many of these different practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: from natural farming, fermentation,
to soil food web growing in super soils
[SPEAKER_00]: that are super aerated, both methods show
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's unpack that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You took that in a way that I wasn't
expecting, because what I thought you were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to say is that the microbe life,
the rhizosphere that the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: has evolved to interact with, right,
where the cannabis plant is getting
[SPEAKER_01]: sunshine, it is photosynthesizing that and
turning it into exudates that come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: its root structure and feed the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, those microbes are
living and excreting nutrition that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've got this back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were going to say that for
the cannabis plant, it has that
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with oxygen loving microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is always going to be best
grown in aerated soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But perhaps that is untrue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will cannabis grow just as effectively in
an anaerobic soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love about you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: No punches held.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Alan Atkin's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it right, because Alan's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alan Adkisson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm horrible in enunciations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't spell because I come from New
England and I can't announce either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, wait until you start saying
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhizosphere.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead, Alan.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's proven that it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, you can actually hold
back viruses or genetic drift from
[SPEAKER_00]: continuing in an anaerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember distinctly this was the
first Regen conference in Humboldt at
[SPEAKER_00]: beginnings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Elaine, myself, Joshua went to see
Kev.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kevin was excited to see Elaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right away, this earth box came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be a fly on the wall and know how
much Elaine preaches of the horrors of
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic environments, I was just
enamored that he was explaining how he had
[SPEAKER_00]: basically saved a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget the name of the virus that causes
dudding, but had saved the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped the dudding, and was actually able
to now grow the plant out to some degree
[SPEAKER_00]: of success by exposing it to full sun and
an anaerobic root base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought Elaine was going to fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also SIPs where you're using
anaerobic water underneath soil and having
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots push through and down into that
anaerobic water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some efficacy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I think that you have to look at
what cultivar you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you took a plant or a cultivar
with a strong dominant history that came
[SPEAKER_00]: from perhaps Afghanistan and threw it in a
swamp or Amazon, I don't think that it
[SPEAKER_00]: would perhaps do very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although nature proves us wrong all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that environment, I would say that,
again, personally speaking, I prefer the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle ground biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that in nature,
you get extremes more so now than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a natural setting, perhaps you
would get a drought during the summer and
[SPEAKER_00]: a deluge in spring and fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both in spring and fall, you would be
thresholding on anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the summer, you would be obviously
extremely aerobic as things dried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, believe it or not, but as the soil
structure dries out and the biofilm cakes
[SPEAKER_00]: and turns to flake, soil structure can
easily collapse, especially if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to pressure, either from a foot or
from an extreme rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that aerobic summer soil all of a
sudden gets pounded by a deluge in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before harvest, that soil structure is
going to collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're back in an anaerobic
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing you can do to change
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because over time, it will happen
naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not going to instantly turn
compacted soil into aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow suit, now is a good time to
start using your fermented plant extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: to finish the plant, even though its roots
are basically soggy and not in an aerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, something else that you need to take
into consideration, too, and that is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability of that root and the
rhizosphere, which is the coating around
[SPEAKER_00]: it where all the magic happens,
interestingly enough, can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms that eat certain elements and
excrete oxygen and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also change the pH of the soil
around the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of magic happening in
this microbial plant-soil interaction that
[SPEAKER_00]: science hasn't completely caught up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yes, we've identified these five
phosphate-solubilizing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in nature, they're in a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is what I want to call
biological succession, exactly like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's plant succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go from the swamp, zero oxygen or very
low oxygen, all the way up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: redwoods, very oxygenated, highly fungal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The swamp is bacterial dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing is happening in a biological
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are moving through succession on a
constant basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole system is in flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking that into consideration,
I, again, don't think that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: right or wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I would caution you to use
common sense and biomimicry and not just
[SPEAKER_00]: waterboard your cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely give it some time to dry down
if you're going to overwater it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know people that water stress,
and they have good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I think it's comfort level as to
what you feel is your best methodology for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen extremes, and they've shown
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whether they got full genetic
potential, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have to be done in a
side-by-side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I've tried to get a
cannabis cultivator to do a side-by-side,
[SPEAKER_00]: it starts out great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the documentation at the end never
seems to quite happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are documentation challenges with
citizen science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be a big fan of it, but even I don't
like to document everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to talk about one more aspect
before we go to our first commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: break.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we come back from the commercial
break, we're going to talk a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: about taking your soil from an anaerobic
environment to becoming aerobic and how to
[SPEAKER_01]: condition the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to hit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the last thing I want to hit here is,
in this first set, giving people a picture
[SPEAKER_01]: of what anaerobic and aerobic environments
are looking like, we just pinged the
[SPEAKER_01]: extremes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how most of us are farming,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of us are farming with,
maybe it's new, young soil, or maybe it's
[SPEAKER_01]: last year's soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's just say, unless you just bought
a partner parcel and you are working on
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible soil, or if you just brought your
pots out of a dry garage and they were all
[SPEAKER_01]: stacked on top of each other, so they're
dry, hydrophobic, and compressed,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, generally people are using
fluffy soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with these extremes, that should
be considered the, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I could say gold standard,
but our default setting is to grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: aerobic environments with oxygen-loving
microbes because we're growing an
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen-loving plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to back up if we've confused
anybody because our examples were pulled
[SPEAKER_01]: from extreme examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to make sure people understand
you don't have to suddenly start growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in an anaerobic environment to have the
plant thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at the entire picture,
but really we're still saying grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: aerobic environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super soil or soilless mediums are by
nature oxidative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of pore space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We consider them low-tension soil,
and by tension I mean the ability of water
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold pressure in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, when you're pulling out those
pots after you've been sitting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter, over the winter, dry and with no
plants in them, you are going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobic issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question is how best to land a
inoculant on that material that can hold
[SPEAKER_00]: and take footing, take hold to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where you're best to try to
get a lot of the material back to a
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophilic state so that you're not
fighting it and everything you pour on it
[SPEAKER_00]: just runs over the top and off the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's yucca extracts, which is a
surfactant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it helps the water coating or helps the
water coat instead of bead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've all seen water droplets bead up
on the hood of your car, but you've also
[SPEAKER_00]: seen when water just glazes or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where these surfactants really
play a good role in creating that moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: bond to the material that basically has a
coating of wax around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in the past shows we did talk
about what that really means, hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically when the bacteria are
not in an environment where they're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will go into a cyst form or insist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what that means is they
create a wax coating around the outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in turn, because there's so much
of them and there's obviously biofilm,
[SPEAKER_00]: that biofilm helps to insulate it for a
period of time, although eventually that
[SPEAKER_00]: biofilm will flake off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those organisms will have by then
prevented moisture from getting into that
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so therefore that's why you have that
hydrophobic condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have big hydrophobic problems
until you and I did the biomimicry
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to say that the last two
years, I haven't had any issues with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but God, it was at the top of my list of
issues back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and take our short
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we come back, we'll talk about
taking compressed hydrophobic anaerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and turn it away from the dark side
and bring it to the aerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for folks who wanted to hear more of
what Alan Adkisson's experiments looked
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you can go ahead and listen to
Shaping Fire episode 15 called Open Source
[SPEAKER_01]: Probiotic Growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Alan and I discuss his earth box and
the attractiveness of lactobacterias.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's actually a historian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you actually get to hear about how labs
and inoculated caches were used all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way back by Roman soldiers to help calm
them when they came back from war.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all incredibly interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is soil biologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: Layton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_01]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a replacement for using peat
[SPEAKER_01]: moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_01]: container growing, but organic growers
know that peat moss is an unsustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: resource and the mining of peat bogs
destroys habitat and releases sequestered
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now there's finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that shares the
[SPEAKER_01]: same benefits while also being
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems, it actually is made from
upcycled organic paper and tree bark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_01]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption, and water
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades-long
[SPEAKER_01]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat
moss and handles exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like peat moss, pit moss is inert so
it won't change your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Available in a range of preparations
including a nutrient-enhanced blend,
[SPEAKER_01]: a coco coir blend, and also as an organic
soil conditioner with no added nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to pitmoss.com now to learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's P-I-T-T-M-O-S-S.com.

[SPEAKER_01]: With the national hemp program influx due
to stringent THC testing requirements,
[SPEAKER_01]: brothers Seth and Eric Crawford continue
to release seeds to hemp farmers that will
[SPEAKER_01]: be legal, no matter how you grow them or
when you test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These new varieties from Oregon CBD seeds
have substantial amounts of CBDV,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBGV, CBCV, and THCV while always staying
below the 0.3% THC limit and guaranteeing
[SPEAKER_01]: complying crops for farmers every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, these new varieties cannot be
pollinated by your neighbor's uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen or a rogue male in your own crop
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD seeds are non-GMO certified
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD seeds was founded and funded in
2015 by Seth and Eric maxing out their
[SPEAKER_01]: personal credit cards without outside
investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They continued to refuse outside
investment that would change their company
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD grows tons of fresh food on
their research farms for local food banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally tons of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also give away tens of thousands of
pounds of R&D flour to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: As their company began to succeed,
Seth and Eric started donating money to
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause
too by giving millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon State University in order to
establish the world's leading cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics research program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they treat their employees right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD pays for full health and dental
coverage for their employees, a 401k
[SPEAKER_01]: program, and their minimum starting wage
is 20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus everyone shares food from the farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth has been on shaping fire a few times
to talk about novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check out episodes 25 and 37 on
CBD cultivars and the hemp market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 66 on triploid cannabis genetics
and the very first shaping fire live
[SPEAKER_01]: episode 47 with Seth and soil expert,
Jeff Lowenfels talking about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a hemp farmer and you want to
grow reliable seeds that are sure to
[SPEAKER_01]: thrive in past testing, check out
oregoncbdseeds.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_01]: buying seeds for the 2021 season.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's oregoncbdseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no doubt that auto flowering
cannabis plants have finally come into
[SPEAKER_01]: their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And night owl seeds works tirelessly,
bringing you auto flower genetics that are
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable, thriving, and with extraordinary
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Night owl seeds is an industry leader
because of the focus work of their
[SPEAKER_01]: founder, Daz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daz is passionate about the cannabis plant
and pushing what auto flowers can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cultivators know that these efforts
show through in his seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And night owl seeds really are
extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take a look at the thousands of
photos and buy fans on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: The proof is there and obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes are complex and rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants have vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a fan of Mephisto genetics like
I am, you'll likely also love night owl
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Night owl founder Daz worked with Mitch
Mephisto to build the Mephisto brand for
[SPEAKER_01]: years, including breeding Mephisto's much
loved Sour Stomper and Cosmic Queen
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing both night owl and Mephisto
this year because I want the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And night owl seeds knows how to cultivate
community too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daz puts out great stickers, exclusive
packaging for limited runs, and desirable
[SPEAKER_01]: freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really draws you in if you love
creative branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Night owl even has the secret owl society
text club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just text the word night owl, one word,
to 760-670-3130 for early announcements
[SPEAKER_01]: and exclusive opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you can see lots of photos and
find out about other upcoming drops by
[SPEAKER_01]: following the night owl seeds Instagram
too at Daz.NightOwl.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Daz.NightOwl.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get your packs of night owl seeds
at several distributors, including DC Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: Exchange, Insane Seeds, and Hembra
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's night owl seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difference because we're
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is soil biologist, Leighton
[SPEAKER_01]: Morrison.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in second set, we're going to kind
of shift gears a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the first set, we all talked about
the nature of anaerobic and aerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: environments, some examples, how to think
about them, the extreme examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so far you kind of got a
good picture of, you know, these different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second set, we're going to kind of
go through kind of a specific example of
[SPEAKER_01]: working with your soil when you're coming
from an anaerobic abused soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: what most of us would call dirt,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Before it's teeming with life,
it's compressed and there's not much going
[SPEAKER_01]: on there and most of us would call it dirt
and then we build it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this all comes specifically from,
I think it was three episodes back,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was interviewing Joey Berger and I was
using for an example about how I use
[SPEAKER_01]: these, you know, incredibly aerated teas
in my garden every summer and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I love my brewer and how I like,
you know, bubble it up and then I go and I
[SPEAKER_01]: pour it both as a root drench and foliar
leaf for most of my plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: food and medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he pointed out something that blew my
mind and he pointed out, he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you know, you are pouring your
highly aerated compost tea full of
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen-loving microbes into a soil
environment that's anaerobic because in
[SPEAKER_01]: this example, the soil was unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's all like, those, you know,
those soil-loving microbes, or excuse me,
[SPEAKER_01]: the oxygen-loving microbes are going to
have a rough time of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really blew my mind because I
really thought of aerobic compost teas as
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of being the universal superhero
perfect for any situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I get the idea that, oh,
when I pour it on this anaerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, I'm actually just creating a
bunch of death and sludge in the area
[SPEAKER_01]: because these microbes are going to
immediately die and then they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be removed from the, you know,
from the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I called you, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you explained to me the subtleties
about the type of aerated teas slash
[SPEAKER_01]: ferments that we need to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's kind of go through that process,
if you would with me, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our example, we have got ourselves
an anaerobic dirt environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am happily about to dump a whole
bunch of ultra aerated tea on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a better way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is the better way?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's quantify some stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the greatest spiritual lessons I
ever learned from a friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: John at the Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To define something as right is to
automatically define everything else as
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you let that resonate in
your head for a minute, you'll understand
[SPEAKER_00]: more about what I'm trying to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the greatest strengths that I found
in taking dirt and converting it into
[SPEAKER_00]: aerobic soil is the use of fish frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I started this journey a long time
ago as a kid, but later to pick it up
[SPEAKER_00]: after a divorce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time I was working with
aquaculture companies to harvest their
[SPEAKER_00]: fish manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to think about this for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that manure went from aerobic,
as it came out of the body of the fish,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a water column of 8 to 10 parts per
million, sank to the bottom, where it
[SPEAKER_00]: started to go through an anaerobic
digestion, for lack of better words,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a point where it was screened out
through a filtration, where it went 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would take this material and I
would aerobically stabilize it until I had
[SPEAKER_00]: this sweet smell, which I associated with
certain biology because I was able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the microscopy to verify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about that, that went
from aerobic to anaerobic back to aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what type of organisms will be present?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the environment isn't right,
they will cyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have this incredible toolbox full
of anaerobic, aerobic, and facultative or
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen-tolerant anaerobes, as well as low
oxygen-tolerant aerobes, and everything in
[SPEAKER_00]: between.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my work, here's a great story,
an example, a dear client of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvey Hubbell, whose father the telescope
was named after, called me about a
[SPEAKER_00]: cornfield that had been in production for
60 years, and it was horribly beat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had tried to convert it to a hayfield,
with little to no success, called me and
[SPEAKER_00]: brought me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing I did was obviously soil
testing, infiltration, deep pit
[SPEAKER_00]: percolation, test, the deep pit was so I
could map out the horizons, soil
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry, saturated paste test,
and obviously I put some under the
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope to take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I got all the test data back,
I took into consideration what it would
[SPEAKER_00]: cost to just zero this field,
chemistry-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up that I would have to spend
$2,400 per acre to put the chemistry back
[SPEAKER_00]: in complete balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would have been $24,000 for a
10-acre field to grow hay in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I explained what I found to Harvey,
knowing clearly he wasn't going to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of money, but it opened the door
to allow me to do a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bottom line was, I said, okay,
obviously you've got sparse grass or hay,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got clumps and patches of dirt,
it's horribly compacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took my finger out and I tried to press
it into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, look, I can't do anything,
this is compacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my experience, I'm going to use a
not completely aerobically stabilized fish
[SPEAKER_00]: manure, along with a slightly anaerobic
compost to initially land the first round
[SPEAKER_00]: of soldiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: To begin to convert this soil or dirt
toward soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also asked the farmer that was doing the
hay to get a little bit more diversity in
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed mix, like clovers and some
flowers and stuff that would not hurt the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers, the cows and the horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did an application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I had him seed the whole
property, seed the 10 acres, and right
[SPEAKER_00]: after he seeded it, I came in and applied
this biological concoction or mayonnaise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I asked that I have the ability
to come back in midsummer and do just a
[SPEAKER_00]: biological food, which is essentially a
water, molasses, and kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that after the first cutting,
that I be allowed to come back again and
[SPEAKER_00]: apply a completely aerobically stabilized
compost extract, as well as the fish
[SPEAKER_00]: manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, that company is called Fish
Brew on Cape Cod, fishbrew.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to get this product,
it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot speak highly enough about it,
because again, what I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are getting a complete suite of
biology, both anaerobic, aerobic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And needless to say, I came back just
before the second cutting, and I brought
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvey out into the middle of the road,
and I pointed him at the field that we
[SPEAKER_00]: treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, what do you see, Harvey?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, wow, it really looks healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the diversity of the hay,
and I don't have any patchy spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spun him around to look at a field on
the other side of the street that we did
[SPEAKER_00]: not treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, can you see the difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked, and his jaw dropped,
and he spun his head back and looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: the field we treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, oh my God, that field's alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all the birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is teeming with life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was three applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that field is highly productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that purchased the hay
requested the exact same hay and more of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe they've started the process
of getting another field going so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes to show, once you put nature
back in play, it just compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gets better and better and better
with age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's focus in a second on the best
practice there, because the story is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that the part of it that I
want to tease out seems to be this active
[SPEAKER_01]: point where, whereas I have had suggested
in my conversation with Joey that we just
[SPEAKER_01]: put a super aerated tea on anything,
and it works for anything, in this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular example, you took a compressed
and tired field of dirt and you put
[SPEAKER_01]: partially aerated or somewhat
oxygen-loving microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somewhere in the middle, they are I
mean, is there a middle ground between
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobic and aerobic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there like, yeah, we kind of like
aerobic and we kind of like anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do those microbes exist where
those are the ones that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: incubate?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you called it your first wave
army or whatever into the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an actual array of microbes that
you could go for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of fish brood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's fish brood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it went from aerobic to anaerobic
and then back to aerobic based on my work
[SPEAKER_00]: toward it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this particular example,
I didn't fully stabilize it to eight parts
[SPEAKER_00]: per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left it at about four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was teasing out that whole middle
ground that you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is from one part per million to
seven parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where all the magic happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about throwing your
aerobic-loving organisms in and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to just die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're not going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go into cyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to cyst up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I get it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're going to be consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you did actually kill them all,
so say you did or obviously some are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to get into a situation
where they can't cyst up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to die fast enough and
they're going to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call that a nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of putting aerobic compost tea on
soil is to inoculate the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want these organisms to grow out and
thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the case where you murdered them,
you basically have created a nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solution that's plant available,
but it's mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you water it, all of that,
you know, organ, ah, aminos, all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: peptides, all of those metabolites,
tertiary metabolites that are inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: ectoplasm of the cell, which are all
valuable sources of food for plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: now mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you water, they're going to wash
beyond the roots or some of it is some of
[SPEAKER_00]: it will obviously be caught by the roots,
but not all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we don't use, um,
you know, we don't make aerobic tea and
[SPEAKER_00]: then, and then quickly turn it into an
anaerobic so that, so that we kill off the
[SPEAKER_00]: vast majority of them, because now we're,
we're creating a mobile nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the cause of all of the
pollution that we have now in our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment is due to, you know,
those mobile nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it accurate to use the term,
uh, uh, Focaltative when it comes to those
[SPEAKER_01]: partially oxygen loving and partially not
oxygen loving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, let's hit on that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember science is going at light
speed now and the documentation of science
[SPEAKER_00]: is, is at a crawl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're learning is so outpacing our
ability to document it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we know is that the word
Focaltative anaerobes has been thrown
[SPEAKER_00]: around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the term oxygen tolerant
anaerobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are anaerobes that live and
thrive in zero parts per million,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can function to some degree,
perhaps not thrive, um, in a semi aerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is true on the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have anaerobes that thrive in
aerobic environments that can still
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerate low oxygen environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to kind of like overlap these
ideas of, Oh, it's just an aerobar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's just an anaerobe.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's it's, it's similar to the new
understanding that the 80% of terrestrial
[SPEAKER_00]: biology can live in an aquatic environment
and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you gotta just kind of wrap
your head around how nature is,
[SPEAKER_00]: has inherently created this ability to
live and, and work and grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: environments that are not necessarily the
ones they are associated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so if, if our optimum natural
expression is through, um, having both
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes that are, that can succeed in an
aerobic and anaerobic environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, this is a big case for us to have as
diverse soil as possible, dumping a wide
[SPEAKER_01]: range of, of microbes and nutrients and
all this, because really if the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment has both anaerobic and aerobic
microbes, whatever happens with the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution of our pot, even if it goes
south and it goes anaerobic on us,
[SPEAKER_01]: sure, we're going to have like hydrophobic
stuff to deal with, but the plant would
[SPEAKER_01]: still be able to get into a nutritional
relationship with the anaerobic microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though the aerobic microbes have
sisted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you don't want to leave that plant in
a sustained anaerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this isn't the goal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but the diversification is going to
totally backstop a failure on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you screw it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, man, this is, this goes back to the
horizontal soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, these are methods to take
the extremes out of the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you did overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stored down on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the top overrides and dries out,
it'll pull the moisture back up via the A
[SPEAKER_00]: horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is true with, with the work
that I've been doing with microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was, that was the,
you know, accidental amazement or amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that happened when I started playing
around with, with fish manure was that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was by default catching this incredible
suite of organisms that again,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of them can survive in a terrestrial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came from both aerobic anaerobic
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I stabilized them back to
aerobic, but if I didn't, they still
[SPEAKER_00]: worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's again using biomimicry
and understanding perhaps bigger picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: like before the great human expansion,
um, there was mass migrations and these
[SPEAKER_00]: migrations were, you know, thousands of
ducks that darkened the sky, that landed
[SPEAKER_00]: in that pond and ate and shit and thrashed
and trashed and then bailed out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they just turned this gorgeous,
beautiful, clear water pond into a mucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: nasty smelling anaerobic cauldron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: That pond came back, roaring back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, this is on Buffalo, deer,
moose, fish, fish would come in and just
[SPEAKER_00]: thrash a Harbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the prey fish would come in or
the predator fish would come in and just
[SPEAKER_00]: trash and trash and take a bite out of
every fish and leave carcasses everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of anaerobic aerobic back and
forth is part of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was part of the beauty of the garden of
Eden before we put an end to it through
[SPEAKER_00]: our mass expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I find it really interesting that
the, the, the, what did you call them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oxygen tolerant microbes are, um,
oxygen tolerant anaerobes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that didn't sound right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they're, that they're from the,
the water food for water food web,
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily that you've just, we've
discussed so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for anybody who's not familiar with
the water food web, you should go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: check shaping fire episode 52 with Steve
Reisner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the first time, like I've
been in love with the soil food web ever
[SPEAKER_01]: since I started really caring about
cultivation of cannabis, but to find out
[SPEAKER_01]: that there is a, a, a, an entirely
different food web that takes place in
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it really blew my mind,
but, but now you're talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: water food web and bringing these oxygen
tolerant anaerobes over to help us
[SPEAKER_01]: condition soil, to bring it, to take it
from a zero oxygen to a medium oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can make it to a high oxygen and
slowly, but surely, you know, rejuvenate
[SPEAKER_01]: this soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are most of these oxygen tolerant
anaerobes in the water food web,
[SPEAKER_01]: or are those just your preferred ones to
use because of their ease of accessing
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a great question,
but the answer is, um, do you ever made
[SPEAKER_00]: stinky compost?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not intentionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: If my compost stinks, I failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are, those are terrestrial
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are, um, oxygen tolerant anaerobes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they didn't just happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they were there or present and they
became, uh, active due to either lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen as it went down or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the oxygen went up, as things started
to break down and you moved from
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophilic to mesophilic, um,
they became active again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you can't look at it like,
it only goes in one direction because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the bigger picture that I'm getting
out of this is that so long as we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: working in a non natural sterile ish
environment, like, um, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic hydroponic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where, where, you know, places where worms
can't live, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so long as we are, are using natural
practices, there will always be in all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the water, all of the soil, in every
rhizosphere, there are going to be both
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobic and aerobic microbes because of
the natural diversity of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually what we want to do is we want
to move our soils from being compressed
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt-like anaerobic to be increasingly
aerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal is never to get rid of the
anaerobic microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want them to cyst up and hang out
in case we screw up the pot and we need
[SPEAKER_01]: them as part of our save.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think that there is,
there is a warning here that putting on an
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic stinky tea, um, in, in quantity
on a very aerobic and aerobically
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilized, um, biology is that the
primary, um, nutrient cycle in the
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic world, which is called the
ciliate will buzz around and consume
[SPEAKER_00]: flagellates as well as bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he is nutrient cycling on a scale
that's mind boggling compared to amoeba
[SPEAKER_00]: and flagellates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's, he's, he's nutrient cycling
at 10 X of what they can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if he's consuming all your
flagellates, it's going to take longer for
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil to rebound back because you have
lost ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I never encourage anybody to
use a high quantity of, um, aerobic or
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic, uh, compost tea or a firm ends,
um, on a highly aerobic environment
[SPEAKER_00]: because you are going to step back at a
point where you've lost a lot of your
[SPEAKER_00]: buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to take a fermented plant
juice, um, which again is being fermented
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically, therefore it is being loaded
with anaerobic organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to take some of that and
dilute it out in the natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies, there's no problem
whatsoever with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not landing billions of hostile
ciliates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting a few?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt in my mind that there's going to
be some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but again, you know, diversity is,
is a wonderful thing in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you don't see just one type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you always see, you know, diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you're, it's not like the
soil, even the most aerobic natural soils
[SPEAKER_00]: on the, on the surface of the earth,
the living skin, for lack of better words,
[SPEAKER_00]: is not going to have anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's course it's going to, it's going to
have anaerobic pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we see that even with an
aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aggregates are basically a bacteria
comes along and lands on a clay platelet,
[SPEAKER_00]: divides, grows out biofilm to protect
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That biofilm touches a silt particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep expanding out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that, now that biofilm is expanded
onto a sand particle and this bacteria is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing kids dividing left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before you know it, you have a micro
aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, eventually that turns into a macro
aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and this is something that you and I
have talked about in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, into a rhizos sheath, which is the big
clump that you pull up when you pull up a
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a giant sheath inside of that
sheath on a microscopic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be anaerobic pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to all be a hundred percent
aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the, the, the mythology
of, of, um, understanding, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole bigger picture of what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biologically in a soil system is that,
you know, you are going to have anaerobes
[SPEAKER_00]: and you may actually really need them at
certain times, like overwatering or
[SPEAKER_00]: underwater, you know, where you have the
aerobes that are going to come out and do
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, the heavy lifting for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's again, it's diversity,
diversity, diversity in everything and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard you describe that, um,
that biofilm, I don't know, trajectory
[SPEAKER_01]: before, and I've always loved it where if
I get it correctly, you described a,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, a, a microbe finally getting a good
living environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it removes the hard sis protection
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it starts to engage more with its
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It excretes a biofilm, which is like a
gooey substance that protects it from
[SPEAKER_01]: unwanted other microbes and sticks it and
sticks it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so this one microbe, like now is not
sticking to bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's sticking to another bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now maybe it's sticking to, uh,
you know, another life form and then maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: a food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, in my head, this is how the,
where the word aggregate comes from,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like a collection of,
you know, unrelated things that become a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger thing as community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and so this is building a more and
more complex life system of all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're biofilm and occasional food
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a guessing protozoa and amoeba and
stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's making this big gooey sticky
ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that aggregate attaches to
another big aggregate of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now they've doubled in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can see how this is,
you know, increasing at a geometric grate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is what we want to do as soil
builders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that process that we just
described, is that the heart of building
[SPEAKER_01]: soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that's not super soil because in a
super soil or a soilless medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have sand, silt and clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're very limited for biofilm to
actually occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to occur on each
individual fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can't really start to bond the
fibers together to make aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You follow me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the funny thing is, is in my head,
I'm like, well, yeah, who cares about the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil is medium, but of course lots of
people grow that way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people in pots do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, since you did that, or we did that
podcast episode 54, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was the first time I didn't get
laughed off a stage about talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal soil systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've gotten incredible feedback
on Instagram, thanking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: thanking and saying how great it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was, you know,
it wasn't a great, great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just copying nature, but you know,
traditional cannabis, when it came,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when, when camp came around and
they were forced to go indoors or into
[SPEAKER_00]: containers and diesel grows, they weren't
lugging, you know, the natural soil into
[SPEAKER_00]: the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started growing in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course they didn't want to carry a
300 pound pot down into this container
[SPEAKER_00]: buried underneath the ground or into their
house and cave the floor in because the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor wasn't designed to take thousands of
pounds of, of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was obvious they went to peat moss
and core.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably just peat moss and
compost and, and other aeration because of
[SPEAKER_00]: its lightweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, now you did not have
that biological interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden those, um, you know,
organic raw nutrient blends, the stone
[SPEAKER_00]: dust and crab meal and oyster shell that
no longer worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they went to bottled newts and this,
this soy profile or soil system,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the soil is medium was a great way or
great medium to hold water and to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was like the natural
progression into the soil is mediums was
[SPEAKER_00]: by default, um, based on, you know,
the government cracking down on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on, you know, the free loving cannabis
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that's why I
continuously use the term soil is medium
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or, uh, super soil because there's
still a tremendous amount of people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there using this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they can go back to using meals
and teas with their super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the originals were just growing
in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really weren't amending the soil that
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they didn't want to haul bales of
peat moss up into the hills to grow their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just planted it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's, that's where all of
this, um, struggles come in, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in understanding, you know,
the difference between tension soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: low tension soil and the limitations of
both, um, you know, low tension soil has
[SPEAKER_00]: its limitations and regular soil has its
limitations because you're, unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: fluff it up or unless you have a highly
aggregated soil, you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to push like you want,
because those roots can't bind or pound
[SPEAKER_00]: their way through that compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where time takes place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get that soil prepared for the
growth of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to try to, you know,
get your yields and get your, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, full genetic potential,
you can't, you can't be planting in hard
[SPEAKER_00]: compacted clay plants, not going to do
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, that's the most cogent and
generous description of soil is medium
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've ever heard, you know,
like, like, you know, sometimes I get on
[SPEAKER_01]: my soapbox and I'm all like, well,
you know, I like the way that Jeff
[SPEAKER_01]: Lowenfels thinks about it, where,
why would you want to grow in anything
[SPEAKER_01]: where, where worms can't live,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's, that's at the,
you know, the basis of so much biology,
[SPEAKER_01]: but your description not only explains
the, you know, the socioeconomic and
[SPEAKER_01]: political impacts that, that caused the
cocoa, but the idea that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: using a, a, a, a non-soil cocoa blend is
comparatively better than unbuilt soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just crappy dirt, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but, but then it takes more
effort and natural farming techniques to
[SPEAKER_01]: really breathe life into compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see again how I can't make the,
uh, like a wholesale claim like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it really depends on where you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: What resources do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: What natural inputs do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the legal environment where you
are?
[SPEAKER_01]: How strong are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you an immobile patient?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these speak to what is going to be
best for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's very humbling and a
good reminder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when, when, when so many of us
want to judge folks for their growing
[SPEAKER_01]: style online, you don't know their whole
big picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stop, so stop thinking that we know
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's again, it goes back to defining
something is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even, even if you never intended to,
to say that you're doing, someone else is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did by defining, oh, this is the best
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's everybody's situation and
circumstances are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you so beautifully or eloquently
put, you could be a patient in a
[SPEAKER_00]: wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you could have no access to core or
pit moss or, or nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you may be forced to cover crop
just because you don't have anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the money to go out and,
and buy all these inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's, there's a method
for everybody, or maybe I should say
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a madness to the method of,
of letting everybody grow in a manner that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are most comfortable or due to
resources and then encourage them and
[SPEAKER_00]: find, find ways to help them to better
achieve the end goal of, of growing a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some dank ass cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's go ahead and go to our second
commercial break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we come back, we will talk about
a corollary of strategies for building the
[SPEAKER_01]: aerobic nature in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Loafs, and our
guest this week is soil biologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_01]: For 20 years, Humboldt Seed Company has
been family owned and providing reliable,
[SPEAKER_01]: high yielding seeds originating in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: While the current trend is to slap one
super male into a line of hype strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Company continues to breed
with precision and care by doing large
[SPEAKER_01]: sifts and back crosses to emphasize the
absolute best traits that a line has to
[SPEAKER_01]: offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of breeding takes time,
talent, and space to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what kind of aroma you are
particularly into, Humboldt Seed will
[SPEAKER_01]: likely have something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you love fruit, you can choose from
banana, mango, apricot, papaya,
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry, blood orange, melon,
and lemons across their various strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have all gas, glue, and classic sour
diesel lines as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there are the heritage
California strains like OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Hare, and Headband, and their
award-winning blueberry muffin is one that
[SPEAKER_01]: delights just about everybody's palate,
especially when concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Company is proud to bring to
market the infamous freak show cultivar 2,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has a great THC high, but looks so
much like a fern that some folks can't
[SPEAKER_01]: even identify it as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plant that really needs to be seen
to be believed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for well-balanced CBD
seeds, Humboldt Seed Company can turn you
[SPEAKER_01]: on to CBD strains that actually have
flavor, like the dill and pepper terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: of Willie G's Lebanese Land Race.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you are looking for regular,
feminized, or auto flowers, Humboldt Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: Company has the gear to make this your
best growing cycle ever.

[SPEAKER_01]: their gorgeous flowers and the
extraordinary freak show plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Company, let them know
Shango sent ya.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has also been vigorously tried by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see side by side showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco.com

[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll see you this weekend at the Auto
Flower Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is soil biologist, Leighton
[SPEAKER_01]: Morrison.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the first set, we made sure we
had a good understanding of what the
[SPEAKER_01]: nature of aerobic and anaerobic
environments are, their definitions,
[SPEAKER_01]: how we should consider them, and some
examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the second set, we talked about
this question of putting anaerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: ferments into an aerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we understood that the key to this is
putting the right kind of tea or ferment
[SPEAKER_01]: into the soil at the right stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you're building your soil,
you're going to be changing the nature of
[SPEAKER_01]: your root drench as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here we are in set three.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about some other,
well, we're going to talk about how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that in a best practice, but also we're
going to talk about some of the strategies
[SPEAKER_01]: for building the aerobic nature of your
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Leighton, let's start with how to add
or how to collect these oxygen tolerant
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobes that we're going to put into our
substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you've already plugged fish brew,
which I'm excited to learn more about,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we continually push to get off the
bottle here on Shaping Fire and also to
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease costs by collecting this stuff on
our own properties if we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So teach us a little bit about collecting
these facultative or oxygen tolerant
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobes in ways that we can do it
natural farming style on our own parcels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to clear up one thing
real quick, and that is I plug fishbrew
[SPEAKER_00]: .com for a reason, because it is an
inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you're not letting your pots
completely dry out or if you're in a tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always encourage people, even though
you're not growing there in the summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: leave a house, plants, cover crops,
something in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Periodically water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it completely dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that, then you're going to
maintain that rich, diverse microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: community at a ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I plugged him not because I want
you to continuously use the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to use it once or twice to
really get that boost, because those
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms are key to building those soil
aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about collecting our own or
wildcrafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I already mentioned the kelp,
and one piece of the puzzle I did not
[SPEAKER_00]: mention is that when that kelp had that
white foam on the top of it, that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: key moment to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't to let that foam crash,
which it would if you let it continuously
[SPEAKER_00]: sit out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get really nasty smelling,
and that is completely anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're trying to catch it in the middle
at a low oxygen, so around four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, when you stick your
nose in there, you're going to smell it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going to be just funky,
like an old musty closet or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to smell horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you stick your hand in there,
your hand is going to be covered with
[SPEAKER_00]: biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the key to quickly turning
plant matter into the composting process
[SPEAKER_00]: without going all thermophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermophilic is when the biology heats
that pile up to a point where it kills the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically kills the vast majority of
the biology off because it's getting up to
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures where things just explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the strongest of these organisms,
cysts, can't handle temperatures at 160
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it takes almost a year for
that compost to come back to a point where
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got those diverse organisms,
because it's happening naturally through
[SPEAKER_00]: transference from air and from the soil
that's underneath the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing you can do, you don't
live near the ocean, is go to a healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: pond or stream and look for aquatic
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Algae is a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I encourage you to wildcraft
responsibly and with respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to go pull up some
aquatic plants, don't rip them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull them out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps bring something in as a blessing
to Gaia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring a little seedling in and plant it
right at the edge of where you've done
[SPEAKER_00]: your collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a kind act to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick up trash on the way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed your soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's another method is to collect
those aquatic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give Steve Reisner a plug
from Potent Ponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came up with what he calls his sponge
tech, which is basically buy a clean
[SPEAKER_00]: natural sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tie something to it to weight it down and
throw it out into this aquatic environment
[SPEAKER_00]: and let those organisms naturally colonize
that clean sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a really smart way of
collecting these initial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way to get these what I want
to call oxygen tolerant anaerobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is the silt, the mud at the edge
of the waterway.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of riparian zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are polluted, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to do your homework to
seek out a place that you know is like in
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The least disturbed you can possibly find
within a reasonable traveling distance
[SPEAKER_00]: from where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do this on vacation and ship it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ways of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way is to take compost that's
highly aerobic and that you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: happy with and over wet it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start pushing it toward the anaerobic
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maintain it and watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is kind of like growing out IMO
3.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to screw up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So IMO 3, you're basically adding all
these food sources and then making sure it
[SPEAKER_00]: never hits the temperature 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does, you turn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to continuously do this until
you break the thermophilic phase and it
[SPEAKER_00]: pushes into a mesophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you're going to really
get that rapid protozoa and fungal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually it's more fungal in the IMO
3.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really protozoa until you get
into IMO 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not going to hang on that too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the understanding of where do these
organisms live in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then either harvesting them there or
recreating that environment at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's tease some of this
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go back to the first one where
you said, okay, number one is collect
[SPEAKER_01]: seaweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we were to collect seaweed,
which I am going to because I happen to
[SPEAKER_01]: live near saltwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go down to the beach and
this is our time of year that we get lots
[SPEAKER_01]: of bullwhip kelp that gets washed ashore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I take some bullwhip kelp and cut
it up and put it into, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: fill up a half of a five gallon bucket
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to then cover it with fresh
water or do I need to cover it with
[SPEAKER_01]: saltwater since that is where those
microbes are from?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're just going to use regular fresh
water.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I encourage you to leave,
you know, I don't even cut it up to be
[SPEAKER_00]: honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just throw it all in the bucket and I
left the sand to be all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, if there's a root attached,
I leave that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then once I've done the ferment,
then I will chop it up and, and blend it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the compost as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but for the fermenting process,
I don't even chop it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can, I don't see any reason
why to not or to, um, because really what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to gain is those
transitional organisms as well as that
[SPEAKER_00]: biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really going to help to create the
perfect environment for this biology to
[SPEAKER_00]: really grow out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we've got the seaweed, we've got
the fresh water and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we learned from that prior episode with
Joy Burger that, that creating these
[SPEAKER_01]: ferments, you need to leave these plants
in a different, for a different amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, depending on how bulky they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seaweed's pretty damn bulky.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long would you let, let this ferment
sit before you used it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did, I've done three of them since
I've been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and generally speaking, and again,
the sun has been at different heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the first one was 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most recent one during summer was,
was seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a key is again,
you're looking for the white foam and you
[SPEAKER_00]: may have to do this a couple of times to
get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're looking for that foam
production and you're looking for that
[SPEAKER_00]: smell to turn from like fresh kelp to this
funky, like something that your nose goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, it doesn't recognize it as
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't recognize it as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it sends a warning to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't recognize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when your nose tells you that,
then you know it's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you'll have that and you'll have the
bubbles on the top and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: boom, done the foam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and so I would assume that that is
also the same technique for like the
[SPEAKER_01]: general aquatic plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually probably freshwater plants that
are, you know, around your ponds or vernal
[SPEAKER_01]: ponds or whatever, where you live,
you'll go and you'll put those in fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: water, put them in the sun for seven to 10
days and remove it when you, when you
[SPEAKER_01]: smell the beginning of funk and you see
some of the bubble ization.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how, what are you going to do that
with silt and mud?
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be a pretty different
substance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of adding water, you're adding
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember how I told you to harvest your
silt when you were building your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you to let it dry out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just spread it all out on a big tarp or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so the exact same thing, you're
spreading it out to a point where it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit easier to work with and it
doesn't have that stink to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if, I don't know about you,
but I've done plenty of hiking in and
[SPEAKER_00]: around swamps and rivers and you know,
you find those Oxbows or where you get an
[SPEAKER_00]: eddy, where the water actually swirls
backwards against the current along the
[SPEAKER_00]: edge of the banks and you step in that and
you'll sink to your knee in mud and you
[SPEAKER_00]: pull your foot out and you're like,
Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's no rank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want that rank smell,
but you want that funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like your nose doesn't know what the hell
this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing the opposite of adding
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're adding air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're spreading it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't probably suggest using the sun
because you'd really have to be on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: this to catch it at the right point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want that silt to go from squishy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you grab it, it squishes through your
fingers to the point where it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to clump up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've, you've, you've aerobically
stabilized that anaerobic silt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then am I going to put that
back into water or that's it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and so why top dress with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Top dress with it, blend it with your
compost, blend it with your aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blending part's probably pretty
valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I can imagine if you just top dress
with it, that it would be tempted to shift
[SPEAKER_01]: back to anaerobic as it gets soppy wet
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I would, I would recommend
taking a, like a, a little bit coarser
[SPEAKER_00]: than a window screen and making a little
screen box and then taking that clump and
[SPEAKER_00]: just screening it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're, you're breaking it all apart
into little pieces right over the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever your top dressing or screen it
into a bucket outside and bring it in and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just, you know, throw it on with your
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it won't, it, when you,
when you've micronized it, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like saying, well, I made, you know,
flour meal or oyster meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go back to a shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's never going to go back to that
original state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's permanently broken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's permanently destabilized or
micronized.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then the other variety you
suggested was to take, if I understand it,
[SPEAKER_01]: aerobic compost and then add a bunch of
water to it and then squeeze it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just push it, push it toward
anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure most of the audience has come
in contact with stinky compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason it's stinky is because it's
anaerobic or low oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you can, in all of these
examples, it's so easy to screw them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to learn the craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect to be a one in master.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really, you're looking for certain
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using your common sense and
intelligence to understand that,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, I don't want to put a huge clump of
stinky mud on top of my plant or no,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to let this ferment to a
certain point that it becomes a stinky,
[SPEAKER_00]: nasty smelling thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to catch it at just the right
time where it's in transition and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to help me transition my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of a super soil or a soil
is medium that, that kelp ferment or that
[SPEAKER_00]: aquatic plant ferment, you're going to
know because it's slimy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like gelatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like aloe when you put that,
squish that stuff out on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biofilm that's going to create
the environment to, for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology to explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is, this is a delicate
process and your, the chances of screwing
[SPEAKER_00]: it up are far greater than getting it
right, especially the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and again, if the more you monitor
it, the more you love it, and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to it, the better your chances
of a success will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you're trying to push this nice
aerobic, fluffy compost toward an
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if you want to do it
mathematically, that's, that's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to learn how to do it so that
you can repeat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So add a cup of water into this aerobic
compost that's in a compost in a five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon bucket and watch what happens and
then add another cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then add another cup until the point
where you turn it stinky and then rewind
[SPEAKER_00]: to the point where you've added four cups,
not five, and then repeat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once, once you've got, once you've
added the right number of cups of water
[SPEAKER_01]: and it has just started to turn where
you're going like, ah, there is the
[SPEAKER_01]: telltale funk of transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want to capture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to put that through a screen
and make small morsels of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we did with the other site?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that would be, I think that
would be probably the smartest approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you know, if you're starting
with an unscreened compost, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend just screen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's at least easier to break apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean like you screen it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever possible, screen it first so you
don't have to try to do it when it's wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all these clumps sticking together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, start with a screen compost
and then after you get to that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: rescreen it with the same screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've, now you've broken it apart
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those were, uh, one, two, three,
those are four different varieties of
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting, um, oxygen tolerant,
anaerobes, um, facultative anaerobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the other way too, you're,
you're getting, um, aerobes that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, low oxygen tolerant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting both, both, both teams
that play in the middle environment and do
[SPEAKER_00]: well on the other end of the spectrum,
but they come together and play in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's, let's finish off with,
uh, any other strategies that you may have
[SPEAKER_01]: for, um, increasing the aerobic nature of
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the whole point of this is that
we're moving our soil from an aerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: environment to being, uh, less aerobic and
being, um, excuse me, we're moving it from
[SPEAKER_01]: being less anaerobic to more aerobic by
adding new microbes and bacteria that play
[SPEAKER_01]: around in the middle area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what else can we do to build the
aerobic nature of the soil to help this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this aggregation process on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be do, this would be field
soils because obviously soils medium is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be already completely aerobic
because it's got so much poor space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in a field condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we have highly compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say we just bought a farmstead and we're
growing our six plants or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was old farmland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or ag land or, or just, you know,
well used lawn or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would say that the easiest,
but the thing that takes the longest is a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of cover crop rotations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something like a jackhammer radish,
I think they call them daikon radishes,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, are wonderful, uh, for breaking up
compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've actually seen stuff that was so
compacted that, that the radish actually
[SPEAKER_00]: pushed it itself out of the soil,
which is, you know, pretty unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it was a highly compacted clay
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is understandable, but by using,
um, root crops, um, and crops that have
[SPEAKER_00]: known deep tap roots, there's a,
there's a number of, I don't like to call
[SPEAKER_00]: them weeds because I don't believe they
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're what we call successionary
plants that they're basically providing or
[SPEAKER_00]: building the soil for the next succession
of plants to come in by pulling out
[SPEAKER_00]: certain minerals that are deficient in the
soil, bringing them up to the surface and
[SPEAKER_00]: then dying as a plant and releasing them
on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next plant, the next succession can
come in, but that takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans, humans, you know, we have a
hundred years, uh, mother earth thinks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a hundred years is a nanosecond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we want to do this and have it
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're in a situation where you
don't even have the opportunity to cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop for a year, which in all honesty,
personally, I'd like to see people build
[SPEAKER_00]: soil for three years, um, to really get
that to the point where you can just take
[SPEAKER_00]: your whole hand and just stuff it down
into your elbow without any resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautifully aerobic soil that will
send cannabis plant roots flying through
[SPEAKER_00]: this, through the matrix, but that's takes
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and perhaps amendments like,
you know, tilling and compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your, your strategies is, is dependent
on your, again, resources and the time
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have allotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in, in the situation where I have a
highly compacted soil and I want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants this year in this spot,
um, I would say, all right, so what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do is get yourself some really
good compost and you're going to do mound
[SPEAKER_00]: culture kind of like you go culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically you're just going to build a
half of the horizontal soil system right
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that way you'll get your fast rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your seeds, your tap will have the
ability to push down into the existing
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would highly recommend that you do,
um, a soil chemistry test and a saturated
[SPEAKER_00]: pace test because a lot of these,
um, imbalances cause compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go figure, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So by adding some of these required
micronutrients and or macronutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you are going to naturally put into
play the soil chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is probably the most important
thing I can teach anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to look at soil in three
different lights and, and where those
[SPEAKER_00]: three circles come together is the sweet
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, physical sand, silk,
clay, and organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are their relations?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are their proportions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second soil chemistry without the right
chemistry, you're going to have all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of other battles you have to fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, biology, all three are
equally important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, where the three rings come
together, that's the sweet spot where you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've got a fast growing kind
of soil is medium on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our, you know, natural drainage
and our sand, silk clay below that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: put our chemistry into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's a matter of putting the biology
into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so a good inoculant, whether it's your
own compost extract, as long as you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have good organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've traveled the country a number of
times, worked with men, uh, women that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been baking compost 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the best compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, you've got great compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't have any biology in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great nutrient source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, that's another thing
that, um, awareness for compost and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and taking that word and breaking it
apart, what is compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all composts are created the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take ground up organic matter and
call it compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take biodynamic mayonnaise and call
it compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the texture of both of them are
opposite ends of the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really need to define that word a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but anyways, so back to the point now,
now I have this, you know, super soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is medium on the surface for fast
rooting growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put the biology in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the biology is probably going to
wash through, uh, a lot of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that top matrix, but it will establish
itself as soon as it gets into that zone
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two of what you piled on top
and the existing soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to start building soil
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would cover crop all the way
around the outside of this raised bed,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, or mound culture so that those roots
from the plants that I planted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous soil start to push in
underneath that pile and co-mingle with my
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the more plants you can put into
the soil into play, the faster you can
[SPEAKER_00]: build aggregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aggregation is, is a key or is,
is a direct result of glues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that we, you asked me that
question because one of the things I did
[SPEAKER_00]: not cover, um, was other types of natural
glues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sapro, saprobes are past known as
saprophytic, which we can't call them
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore because phytic means plant and
fungi's are not plants, they're fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So saprobes excrete a glue called
glomulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it again is an incredibly strong glue
for bonding soil particulates,
[SPEAKER_00]: sand, silt and clay and organic matter
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fastest way to get aggregation is
to have a high level of biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're using like this,
you know, medium oxygen, uh, environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, biofilms, um, and you know,
increased the bacteria, make sure you do
[SPEAKER_00]: an inoculant of protozoa, which is what's
coming from fish brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, again, you want to get a really
good fungal presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, you know, Elaine,
Dr. Lane Ingham speaks so much about the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal F2B ratio is because you're missing
50% of the entire soil kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not have mycorrhizae and
saprophytes or saprobes doing the work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you by excreting, uh, acids and building
glues and pushing nutrients and cycling
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the new work coming out on
mycorrhizae insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are relationships of bacteria that
move in and out through the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the hyphae internally into the fungi to
perform processes and also move back out
[SPEAKER_00]: and travel down it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some incredible new, um,
videos showing, uh, uh, with some
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible new microscopy, uh,
techniques showing just colonies of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria moving up and down the channels
of the hyphae as if it was a super
[SPEAKER_00]: highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not all going in one
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're, they're going at each
other from both directions and moving
[SPEAKER_00]: around each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do not have these, these
organisms in play, you're losing 50% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential, uh, of, of, you know,
plant genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you're going to use
mycorrhizae and you're going to use it in
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, you've got to have plants growing
nonstop in that or that mycorrhizae is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you use any soft rock phosphate,
you're going to disassociate that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with the mycorrhizae and the mycorrhizae
is going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember it takes 90 days for full
colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means from the root to the source
of sand, silt and clay to mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you have a super soil and you
do not have sand, silt and clay,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't waste your money on mycorrhizae
inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just throwing your money out the
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those guys are what is going to speed
up that aggregation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the case of a mound culture in the
fall, you want to plant it with a winter
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to plant it with something that's
going to continuously feed your biological
[SPEAKER_00]: kingdoms throughout the course of the
winter or until they go dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it freezes and it goes dormant,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going to be in play in
spring, just like it is in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, those are the, those are the
key ways to, to build soil in a unideal,
[SPEAKER_00]: dirtish environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that the mound style is actually
what you taught during the water and
[SPEAKER_01]: watering episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tip for me to get over my hydrophilic
soil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the hydrophobic, hydrophilic,
yeah, yeah, yeah, it's hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hydrophilic, the soil top had gotten
to the point where when I poured my water
[SPEAKER_01]: on it, it just like slid right off like it
was on the hood of a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just slid off to the side and then down
the side of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that episode, you're all like,
heck, you know, cover, cover all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: with compost and make sure it doesn't dry
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep it nice and moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, maybe it took two weeks for
the constant interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of all that, the compost and the
moisture and the microbes, the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteria in the compost, it just like
woke up all of the cysted biology in my
[SPEAKER_01]: bio, hydrophobic soil and, and it just
like melted away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can see how if you had a pile of
that and they were, you know, they were
[SPEAKER_01]: placed nearby each other on acreage,
how it would have that same effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're essentially softening up
parts of its protective you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sheath and incurred coaxing some of the
life to come back and wake up again until
[SPEAKER_01]: that it can then spread itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, like anytime water moves
horizontally and laterally, it's eroding
[SPEAKER_00]: and you do not want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, that's the biggest
problem we have as a, as a species right
[SPEAKER_00]: now is, is the loss of soil through
transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All 80% of all the soils on the on this
planet came from transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's wind or water and to have bare
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I live out here in Oxnard and
every time the wind picks up, you get dust
[SPEAKER_00]: devils and everything is caked with dust
all the time because these guys are just
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly plowing and rotating and
they're never cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't give the soil a chance to,
to heal itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just pound it with more friggin MPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a result of, you know,
that's why the salt, the soil is just
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing away and they're down into subsoil
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, lucky for them that the,
the soil that they have here is this
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing clay sand, clay silt relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really silty clay sand and the
nutritional value of it is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that again, we have very
dry environment and it's windy and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't, they don't, I shouldn't say they
don't have the best practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the practices that they utilize
because they're producing so much food all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's the necessary of what
I want to call manufacturing farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you just constantly put in another
row, another, another round of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: another round of plants, another round of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just never get a chance to stabilize
it and build aggregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could put this mound out in
the middle of your backyard and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see, I mean, it's going to, it's going to
soften the soil probably within five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six, eight feet of that pile once it gets
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I said, you know,
plant, plant all the way around it because
[SPEAKER_00]: that too is going to help to soften even
further out and deeper down as those roots
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrate and, and build rhizosphere and
introduce all those microbes into that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start building aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're, they're hardworking
little guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have reached the end of our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Layton, thank you so much for sharing your
insight as usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as you know, I love coming to

[SPEAKER_01]: do you have the hard earned data and
science to break down, but also,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're a rambunctious
storyteller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're a lot of fun to hang with.

the, the layering technique of creating
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate for containers and pots and
raised beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then also shaping fire episode 59
on water and watering, explaining how
[SPEAKER_01]: water moves itself around the rhizosphere
and how to determine how much water is
[SPEAKER_01]: enough when watering your plants.
