[SPEAKER_00]: As more and more athletes come forward as
using cannabis for training and recovery,
[SPEAKER_00]: many regular folks who exercise to stay
fit are considering adding it to their
[SPEAKER_00]: health plan as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exercise and cannabis are not obvious
friends, since many people assume that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you use cannabis, you sit on the
couch and eat all the snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that's certainly a possibility,
many more people are up and motivated,
[SPEAKER_00]: hiking or working or surfing or reading or
writing or even taking care of the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of the couch-locked stoner is
really more of a stereotype than an
[SPEAKER_00]: actuality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inspiration for this episode came from
the movie American Beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that film, the Kevin Spacey character
is going through a midlife crisis and he
[SPEAKER_00]: turns to cannabis, weightlifting and
fantasy to get him through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that he's working out because he
wants to look good naked, and I think many
[SPEAKER_00]: of us identify with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me thinking about the relationship
between cannabis and exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to understand if cannabis and
exercise were complementary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to know if cannabis could help
all of us look better naked.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today my guest is Greg Gerdeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Gerdeman is a neurophysiologist with
expertise in the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has received research support from the
National Institute on Drug Abuse and the
[SPEAKER_00]: National Science Foundation and his
articles have appeared in the journals
[SPEAKER_00]: such as Nature Neuroscience, Trends in
Neuroscience and Neuropsychopharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: His research, while an assistant professor
of biology at Eckerd College, included the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular physiology of cannabinoid
receptors and their evolution within
[SPEAKER_00]: neural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg is presently chief scientific officer
at Three Boys Farm in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me again, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's so great to have you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off with a quick summary of
the endocannabinoid system for folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: because while certainly more people know
that they have an endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: than used to know, it's still pretty new
to a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, since you have got a history
of being a professor, you're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: really darn good at teaching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start there so that we can build
on that throughout the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you summarize what the human
endocannabinoid system is and how we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more people do know for sure,
having talked about this for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the endocannabinoid system is really
how the endocannabinoids work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was discovered out of a quest,
scientific quest, to understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis works in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, all of that was mostly biased
towards how it's bad and hurt you and is
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even with that bias, we discovered the
endocannabinoid system, which is intrinsic
[SPEAKER_01]: to our body as a mechanism for resilience,
I believe, and homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoids as players in our
body can be called sort of like the body's
[SPEAKER_01]: own THC or cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, if you're familiar with
molecules at all, they're lipid molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come from the membranes of cells,
not just in the brain, but all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: tissues of the body and act at certain
receptors in order to dampen excitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do many different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a basic level, we've got these
endocannabinoids called anandamide and
[SPEAKER_01]: 2-AG.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're molecules that act in many ways
like THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They act at receptors that are on cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they include CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of the, I guess, traditional,
if you will, endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those endocannabinoids and the CB1 and CB2
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We now know it's quite a bit more
complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a system that your body uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It uses all the time to regulate
metabolism, motivated behavior,
[SPEAKER_01]: the synchrony and rhythms of your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, many people will know that when
all of this was discovered, it was hugely
[SPEAKER_01]: surprising to brain scientists,
people like me who study receptors and how
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs and hormones and neurotransmitters
work, because the CB1 cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor, when it was discovered way back
in 89 and more thoroughly in 1990,
[SPEAKER_01]: we discovered that it's the most abundant
receptor system in the brain by far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our brains are really highly,
highly evolved to respond to cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we evolved with the
endocannabinoids in our body, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids in cannabis has been with us
a very long time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at the endocannabinoid
system as our body's master regulator,
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly trying to bring us back to
homeostasis, like you said, or bring us
[SPEAKER_00]: back to balance, if we're running hot in a
category, it will help bring it down and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring us back to center.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're cool in a category or slow or
stagnant in a category, well, it amps it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter if you're high or low,
it's bringing you back to best case
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario for your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this makes a lot of sense then that
this body master regulator would be
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted and be an active participant
every time we exercise, because we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing and blood flow and muscle sets
and adrenaline and all these other things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are playing a role in exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also playing a role in the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does cannabis help us work with the
endocannabinoid system generally when we
[SPEAKER_00]: exercise?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing when we're interacting
with the endocannabinoid system generally
[SPEAKER_00]: when we exercise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, part of what I think is so exciting
is how much we have yet to learn and that
[SPEAKER_01]: now these kinds of questions are something
we can ask out in the open and really
[SPEAKER_01]: explore it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with today's cannabis, that we're able
to understand the diversity of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a starting point, what we've come
to find out and work that I did was part
[SPEAKER_01]: of this, but many other groups have shown
that when you exercise, your body elevates
[SPEAKER_01]: its endocannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the kinds of activities that
can increase circulating levels in the
[SPEAKER_01]: blood of anandamide, at least as an
endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's part of the benefit,
the physiological benefit of aerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: exercise, but it's also been seen with
resistance training and the endomide
[SPEAKER_01]: levels go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the effect that there's sort of
analgesic effect, a euphoric effect that
[SPEAKER_01]: may help to motivate behavior in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all just something that is
intrinsic to how our exercise physiology
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right, the physiology of
exercise is a really unique case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, skeletal muscle and fat tissues
and depth of breathing and so much goes on
[SPEAKER_01]: during exercise that is special compared
to how our bodies normally work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because the human being and our
hominid ancestors, we evolved out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: lineage that evolved to be exercisers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the endocannabinoid system,
I believe, was a key part in what made
[SPEAKER_01]: that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really on this idea that
endocannabinoids actually are part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved ability of these sorts of
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dig a little deeper in that,
because when we were chatting before,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we were setting up this interview
today, I thought it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about the evolution of
humans as a running animal, as a running
[SPEAKER_00]: being, and how essential and integral the
endocannabinoid system is to that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: long distance running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the reasons humans could
get meat is that because over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would run down these animals that
might be faster, but they didn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same stamina that we had, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you riff on that a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think you've got some
interesting stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there are hunter-gatherer groups in
Africa to this day that hunt with sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: persistence or exhaustion techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just like you said, a band of
hunters can basically jog an antelope down
[SPEAKER_01]: to exhaustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for that kind of behavior to evolve
would have been a multi-step process over
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look back tens of thousands of
years to when our hominid ancestors were
[SPEAKER_01]: largely in trees or near them,
there was a big shrinking of the forests
[SPEAKER_01]: of East Africa and areas where homo
sapiens evolved so that you got the
[SPEAKER_01]: development of these big savanna
grasslands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether it's hunting to exhaustion or
just foraging from place to place,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was adaptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the field of biological anthropology
believes these aren't controversial things
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those ancestors who were better at running
were more successful, whether it was
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting or following a vulture to where
something had been killed or just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: to a better place to forage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Endurance running was adaptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so traits that favored endurance
running were adaptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see in humans skeletal muscular
features like the length of the Achilles
[SPEAKER_01]: tendon and certain ways that the head and
the hips sit in their sockets and the
[SPEAKER_01]: length of the femur that make running less
energetically demanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what would have motivated that
behavior in the first place?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because running intrinsically increases
your risk of predatory editors of injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the endocannabinoids fit in nicely as
an explanation in that when you engage in
[SPEAKER_01]: the behavior and you get sort of a
runner's joy out of it from increased
[SPEAKER_01]: circulating endocannabinoids, your sense
of wellness improves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taste of the food you found is
actually better because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all well steeped in research and
similar to how cannabis can affect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have promoted behavior,
a culture of behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a positive feedback loop
driving, we believe, the evolution of
[SPEAKER_01]: humans to be, quote unquote, born to run,
endurance runners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the endocannabinoids are really
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't just get activated when you're
from exercise, but the way they stimulate
[SPEAKER_01]: the appetitive food seeking, they help to
desire and promote feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that goes way back to
deep evolutionary time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even very simple organisms like worms and
hydra that are pre-jellyfish have an
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system that seems to
interact with the control of metabolism
[SPEAKER_01]: and feeding behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where our endocannabinoid system
evolved from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in vertebrate animals that,
of course, include mammals, became
[SPEAKER_01]: mammals, became humans, the base of the
vertebrate family tree, what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: invertebrate cordates, that's when these
CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: have evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only there do you start to see a DNA
sequence that's like the CB1 cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lo and behold, in the time span of
evolutionary development, vertebrate
[SPEAKER_01]: animals have these systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is special about them?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about a vertebrate animal?
[SPEAKER_01]: An evolutionary biologist will identify,
they have identified, what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: vertebrate innovations that appear in our
lineage and nowhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are including a peripheral
nervous system, a very incredibly complex
[SPEAKER_01]: and large head and brain, an adaptive
immune system that recognizes previous
[SPEAKER_01]: threats and responds and remembers them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things that the endocannabinoid
system is all about regulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoids and the CB1,
CB2 receptors are master regulators of
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism, inflammation, the immune
response, and regulation of the complex
[SPEAKER_01]: brains and nervous signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not cannabis culture talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's as mainstream as science get,
that the endocannabinoid system is the
[SPEAKER_01]: master regulator of physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't see that talking in other
literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I can go on about this
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me point you in a continued
direction because I like what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about because basing the
endocannabinoid system in this long
[SPEAKER_00]: history of human evolution, I like how A,
it takes it out of drug culture and like
[SPEAKER_00]: stone culture and even out of science
because science is often trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: like pure medical science is often very on
a pedestal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get to evolutionary science
and anthropology, suddenly things get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more visceral and a lot less
cherished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so going back to what you're saying,
I love the beauty of the idea of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system appears in us as
our DNA starts to become more human.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then part of that is that when we
spark the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: it creates a state in us that we enjoy
food and we're also chasing our food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is the endocannabinoid system
modulating our running experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: giving us that runner's joy, but also
we're chasing down our food so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get more complex fats to build our brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh yeah, once you get there and you
capture the animal and you eat it,
[SPEAKER_00]: your endocannabinoid system is already
like primed for a fantastic meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how that comes together, it's just
fricking beautiful, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like hell yeah nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful because it teaches us more
about who we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I like to say a lot
that the science of cannabis has taught us
[SPEAKER_01]: much more about how cannabis works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taught us a great deal about the
biology of who we are and what it means to
[SPEAKER_01]: be well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But jumping into your scenario,
yeah, you run, there's a control of your
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism and your repetitive drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what has also been very cleanly
and repeatedly shown in various animal
[SPEAKER_01]: research models.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoid system helps to
stimulate neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not only collecting fats to feed
your brain, you're stimulating mechanisms
[SPEAKER_01]: that promote the growth of the brain that
help to create resilience to the anxieties
[SPEAKER_01]: of life by promoting healthy regeneration
of nervous tissue, which we know does
[SPEAKER_01]: happen throughout life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been lots of studies showing
that cannabinoids stimulate neurogenesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: including plant cannabinoids, including as
a consequence of exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't happen if you block the CB1
cannabinoid receptor, even some undersided
[SPEAKER_01]: research that I really like by a group in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of mine, Susanna Wolf,
was the first author of one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: A difficult experiment to do, giving
animals an enriched environment over a
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of listeners may be familiar with
sort of this rat park literature about how
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of, well, a lot of animals are not
housed in a good situation in research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of deprived.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you give animals enriched
environments, there are lots of measures
[SPEAKER_01]: of health benefits there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, they're not as likely to
be, you know, self-administering cocaine
[SPEAKER_01]: and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point here is Susanna's work was
that she did a very long controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment that's hard to fund and found
that enriched environments stimulated
[SPEAKER_01]: neurogenesis, greater rates in brain areas
where it occurs, the hippocampus of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mouse brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that this was blocked in animals that
had CB1 receptors blocked, either
[SPEAKER_01]: genetically they didn't have it or they
were blocking it with a chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: antagonist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to the running thing, we know that
over the history of hominid evolution
[SPEAKER_01]: leading to homo sapiens ourselves,
as greater running mobility occurred in
[SPEAKER_01]: the fossil record and over the course of
evolution, as species began to become more
[SPEAKER_01]: mobile and better runners, their brain
size also increased, their head size,
[SPEAKER_01]: their brain size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this makes sense from a natural
selection perspective in that as an
[SPEAKER_01]: animal, as a species is getting better at
running, your survival demands are
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're better at foraging, you're getting
more metabolic support, but the complexity
[SPEAKER_01]: of the environment moving and traveling
farther, covering more different terrains
[SPEAKER_01]: at different rates, your processing
speeds, your need for processing speed is
[SPEAKER_01]: greater to be able to see changing
environments, remember your environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: have flexibility to new encounters that
you're more likely to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the evolution of humans as were to
be runners also included a growth in the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain and endocannabinoids we know are
stimulated by running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that endocannabinoids are
linked to neurotrophic factors and things
[SPEAKER_01]: that cause increased neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see it, we know the mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of the fun about talking about
evolution is it is always gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: speculative, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's something that's happened in
the past, but man, the pieces are really
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful to make this perspective and
support this perspective that the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system helped to support
the evolution of humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: The evolution of who we are as runners and
the metabolic activity that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the thinking on exercise and
metabolism is that Western community,
[SPEAKER_01]: Western society is dealing with such
issues related to metabolism, diabetes,
[SPEAKER_01]: obesity, sedentary lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we evolved not only to be runners,
but our metabolism evolved with a running
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of set point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we're kind of hard plumbed to burn
through calories like we're running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we don't have exercise in our life,
that extra calories that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: intake, cause you're just set to that,
it ends up going to inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we run an exercise, that's
another thing, oh, by the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoids clearly do,
they dampen down inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I love the whole area and it
does support how natural cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, as a compliment to that
physiology is, but it's not just about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about understanding ourselves and how
an active mobile lifestyle is healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how we evolved and it's a natural
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with patients a lot around the
country and often I'll get people saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to use cannabis because I have
insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can talk all about using THC
short-term and CBD to make the sleep cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: better, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always start with, are you drinking
coffee in the morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're drinking coffee in the
morning, the caffeine half-life means that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go to sleep, you still have
active caffeine in your body, even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: only had one cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, no one wants to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one wants to give up their cup of
coffee to get rid of their insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to keep their cup of coffee and
then they want to take some kind of purple
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered cannabis to help slow them down
at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, to use your example,
people are often, why do I have
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid deficiency or why is it so
common?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we go through the modern
American things, stress, poor sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: poor nutrition, too many pharmaceuticals,
environmental toxins, but really it's that
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bodies are designed over generations
and generations to be mobile, to do
[SPEAKER_00]: physical work, to take in calories,
to burn them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're driving our cars and sitting
on the sofa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, hell, most of the time I'm
working, I'm either standing up talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: people or I'm sitting at my computer or on
a plane sitting at a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm one of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to get more mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like what you said how cannabis
teaches us more or reminds us more where
[SPEAKER_00]: we came from, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's showing that, okay,
if modern life is not working for most
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, what can we learn about how
things we used to live that can help us be
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And health and fitness is not all about
endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can sometimes get into, but
endocannabinoids are a master regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's legit to say that the
endocannabinoid system has been under sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of a multi-pronged attack with the modern,
that is to say, Western lifestyle with all
[SPEAKER_01]: the things you're saying, sedentary-ism
and not having as many leafy greens that
[SPEAKER_01]: will support a healthy microbiome and
probably healthy fatty acid balances that
[SPEAKER_01]: help to generate the endocannabinoid in
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know chronic stress wears down the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Endocannabinoids are a buffer against
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you beat up your buffers,
you run dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a metaphor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But promoting a health and well-being from
an endocannabinoid perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, is an exciting direction that I
certainly like looking at it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our second set, we're going to start
talking specifically about how cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: can help us with different types of
exercise and athleticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we go to the first commercial
break, I want to go all the way back to
[SPEAKER_00]: where we started this set, because you
talked a little bit about how cannabis can
[SPEAKER_00]: help motivate us towards exercise,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've laid out this case that we do
need movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we move, our endocannabinoid system
will reward us with all of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, increased health and thriving
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know I'm not the only one who,
you know, I'm busy and I travel and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't find the time for as much exercise
as I want to, even though, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I continually am getting better at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I liked what you said, though,
that there are aspects of using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that can help motivate us towards
exercise, when that is not the general
[SPEAKER_00]: belief, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are thinking about,
you know, lazy, sedentary stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly there are other factors that
play a role in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why don't you tell us a little bit
about how cannabis can help move us closer
[SPEAKER_00]: to exercise so that maybe some of us can
get a little more motivated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I mean, I think that that's
very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to, in my view,
the way we're talking, because,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, we can talk more later that
there's a lot of talk about cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of recovery because of
anti-inflammatory values.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having an anti-inflammatory a little
on board ahead of time exercising a
[SPEAKER_01]: natural one may be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're talking about motivation and
we're talking about that kind of sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: affect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're probably talking about using
it in low doses prior to exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's because you just learned
that it helps you get in a zone,
[SPEAKER_01]: helps you be less attached to other
distractions so you can focus on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly remember 20 years ago talking
to someone when I was first getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: this research, a scientist I was with at
Vanderbilt said, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be at this running club out in
Eugene, Oregon, and we would all take
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles like half an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: An hour before we ran, then we'd all like,
you know, we'd go on this like 12 mile
[SPEAKER_01]: run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, it's totally helped me
get in the zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard that many times now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been much more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of ultra athletes talking
about that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whether it's that or even,
you know, not just a long distance zone
[SPEAKER_01]: where you need to sort of wear away the
hours while you're exercising.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be just a way to sort of let
loose of what's holding you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think about it in terms
of weight room training and that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: exercising where you might be
self-conscious about form or what your
[SPEAKER_01]: performance is, how much something's
weights are rattling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a judicious use of cannabis
can maybe help you get past that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that your own resistance is holding you
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I related when I was talking to you
earlier about hand drumming, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: something I love to do and have trained
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times what holds you back
from making a great rhythm is yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your inhibition from actually making
the impact with the drum and just feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the same thing is getting in
with the training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like, if you're training and
trying to get over a hurdle, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: value to being coached through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because it helps release sort
of your descending neural pathways that
[SPEAKER_01]: put a little safety check on your own
actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get coached through something,
you're able to push through a little
[SPEAKER_01]: harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not trying to go too far about
what I know that endocannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis does or doesn't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like to think about the idea that
having a little bit of cannabis on board
[SPEAKER_01]: can help you to get past your own
resistance and sort of negative body type
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever and just do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe, maybe with experience,
then going to the gym or your,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever your training situation is taking
that little bitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am, I do tend to say that this would
be what we call a micro dose, just a small
[SPEAKER_01]: little dose can even kind of be a
conditioned experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, okay, there's my exercise
zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, during the, during the
introduction, I talked about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that great scene in the movie,
American Beauty, where the Kevin Spacey
[SPEAKER_00]: character, you know, he, you know,
he's having, you know, all sorts of life
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but to kind of reclaim his life,
one of the things he decides to do is he
[SPEAKER_00]: gets a, he gets a weight bench and he's
starting to smoke some weed again and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: putting on some of the music that
energizes him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I get that man,
you know, I know that if I get too high,
[SPEAKER_00]: then, then, you know, using resist,
like doing resistance training at the gym
[SPEAKER_00]: or something, like being at the gym is too
weird and bright and I just don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but if I just have like, you know,
a little hit off my one hitter,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for many people that'd be a vape pen,
like nowadays, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that little bit, it kind of loosens
up the fact that I generally don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be there lifting weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and suddenly I'm like,
all right, I'm here and I'm in,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a much better mood than I was a
couple of minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of gets me over that initial
hump of, oh my God, I got these,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these other things I should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, cannabis for a lot of
people makes you very, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: emotionally present with where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that's really the only way that
I can work out is if I forget the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: my life that, you know, acts as a
distraction, all the stuff I should be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you know, and, and most of
the stuff we're talking, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about today is going to be
tincture based.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, specifically with lifting,
you know, a little, a little inhaling
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by some, some weight training.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that really works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it does for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I, I laugh a little bit about the
American beauty reference because my,
[SPEAKER_01]: my buddy, Mike, who got me back into
training a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm in the best shape that I've been
since college.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and I've been happy about that
and doesn't always involve a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but it usually does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, uh, he laughed at me and refer
to that exact, exact clear clip when I
[SPEAKER_01]: came to him a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, I'm not happy with how I
look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he jokes, cause that character,
you know, was asked like, why,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are you trying to hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you trying to run certain,
you know, eight miles or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I just want to look good naked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I don't look good, but you know,
public health and epidemiological studies
[SPEAKER_01]: have shown that overall cannabis users
tend to have better lower body mass index.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not that we are fatter and
lazier and actually so germane to this
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation, Shango, you know,
a paper just got, it's not even fully
[SPEAKER_01]: released, but it was announced as a
pre-release, um, by a group out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado and Ken Hutchinson is one of the
senior authors who did a online survey
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst people using cannabis and legal
States had something like 600 respondents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the questioning was, do you endorse
the use of your cannabis around exercise
[SPEAKER_01]: and a large majority?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was approaching around 80%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of cannabis users associated it with
helping them or endorsing it with that
[SPEAKER_01]: exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: More of them were relating it to the
recovery phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but a significant number, I look
forward to reading the actual paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: a significant number did discuss it in
just the way that you and I are that it
[SPEAKER_01]: helped to, to motivate them or support
their performance in some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, I was at a panel on
the Emerald cup in December with some
[SPEAKER_01]: great athletes and they too were,
you know, across the field, a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of, um, athletes do feel like
there's a benefit to whether it's flow
[SPEAKER_01]: state or something of that, whatever you
want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you and I have just been talking about
it in terms of, all right, I'm there,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think these are all just fascinating
topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and moreover, there are topics
that are all about helping people feel
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the break, we are going to come
back and we're going to talk more about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and the actual physiology of
exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you are listening to shaping fire and
my guest today is Greg Gerdeman,
[SPEAKER_00]: chief scientific officer at three boys
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to home growers, patients and
commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably talking to you when you plan
out your next growing cycle, be sure to
[SPEAKER_00]: check out Humboldt CSI seeds at Humboldt
CSI.com Caleb and specta and his family
[SPEAKER_00]: have lived in Humboldt County for over a
hundred years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary sense of me at cannabis and
Humboldt Mendocino and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his lineage and the hard earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long time heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ask around Caleb,
also known as inspecta and pirates of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald triangle is a breeders breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_00]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year here on Vashon Island and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment right now and visit Humboldt
CSI dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an up to date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Humboldt CSI dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_00]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes sold by true terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are certified organic, non-GMO and
food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that they are extracted from
real plant sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no solvents of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, terpenes from true terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is, other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you stack those terpenes to make
your blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes also have strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, like Durbin Poison, Sunset
Sherbet, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_00]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_00]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
true terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your oil, or edible, or capsule,
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose true terpenes for a top-shelf
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to shapingfire.com board slash true
terpenes to find out more, or click on the
[SPEAKER_00]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Greg Gerdeman, Chief
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientific Officer at Three Boys Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we were talking a lot
about the historical significance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system and how we evolved
as mobile human beings, and then a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about motivation, because as we all
know, you know, getting motivated to
[SPEAKER_00]: exercise in the first place is,
you know, is a challenge for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, including me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this set, we're going to talk more
about the impact, the interplay between
[SPEAKER_00]: the human endocannabinoid system,
cannabis, and exercise, and how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: working together to, I don't know,
build a better human.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Greg, why don't we start there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, specifically, how does
supplementing our body with cannabis help
[SPEAKER_00]: us strengthen and build muscle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I'm a scientist,
I'm always going to back up and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, we're not totally sure about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's the cannabinoid system and
working with cannabis in that it can help
[SPEAKER_01]: support better metabolism and storage of
fats may help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's another piece that's pretty
mysterious is that we now know that there
[SPEAKER_01]: are cannabinoid receptors actually on
mitochondria that are the AP generating
[SPEAKER_01]: powerhouses of the cell, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really weird that there's a
neurotransmitter receptor that's on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface of neurons and all over the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also found on mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of what makes this receptor
system so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's literally a mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoid system is not just a
system like here's a group of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: producing cells and they project
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the case we're talking about
dopamine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can point to every dopamine cell in the
brain and they project everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's the dopamine system right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoid system is more like an
endocannabinoid mechanism that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: fundamental cellular mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all over the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in when it comes to exercise and you're
talking about building muscle,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's certain aspects that,
well, endocannabinoids may be involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of the healing of your micro tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of thing that is involved in
building muscle mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's something I want to go into
that that you haven't heard from me yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a recent study came out that I'm
really excited about that looks at how
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors
work at the at the neuromuscular junction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the neuromuscular junction is where
when you're doing any voluntary movement,
[SPEAKER_01]: moving a hand, finger or foot,
there are neurons that are coming called
[SPEAKER_01]: motor neurons from your spinal cord really
comes from your motor cortex down to your
[SPEAKER_01]: spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your spinal cord sends motor
neurons to your muscle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the release of neurotransmitter called
acetylcholine at that neuromuscular
[SPEAKER_01]: junction is what causes your muscles to
contract and move.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the neuromuscular junction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whereas we know that cannabinoid
receptors and endocannabinoids act at
[SPEAKER_01]: connections between cells and the brain
synapses, like practically every synapse
[SPEAKER_01]: in the entire human brain is impacted in
some way by endocannabinoids, if not using
[SPEAKER_01]: it on the regular studies of the
neuromuscular junction have been less
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a study just came out recently,
it was in the journal scientific reports
[SPEAKER_01]: just in the last couple of months,
showing that endocannabinoids are released
[SPEAKER_01]: by contracting active muscles and travel
backwards and hit the neuromuscular
[SPEAKER_01]: junction in this similar way that it does
in the brain that I helped to describe
[SPEAKER_01]: like 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the brain, there's a key difference
here in the brain, endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: traveling backwards dampen the release of
neurotransmitters and kind of slow things
[SPEAKER_01]: down at the neuromuscular junction,
where physical activity is stimulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoids actually increase the
level of neurotransmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a study done in mice,
but there were some really key findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, they showed a synthetic CB1
agonist did this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish they had used THC, but such as big
animal research, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nonetheless, they mimicked it with a
cannabinoid agonist activator and it
[SPEAKER_01]: increased at a very, this is very heady
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're like counting vesicles of
neurotransmitter released basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They show that at that level, it's
increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the inverse of what happens
in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why would this be adaptive?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe this is an ability,
part of the ability of exercising muscle
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue to overcome fatigue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just start increasing the release of
how effective the motor neuron is driving
[SPEAKER_01]: the muscle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the cellular physiology of fatigue
and why it happens is not so obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe this is a breakthrough
understanding in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But secondly, they looked at a mouse model
of a disease called myasthenia gravis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you familiar with this at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune
disorder and it manifests with muscle
[SPEAKER_01]: weakness and clumsiness related to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a short version.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get muscle weakness because again,
it's autoimmune where the body is
[SPEAKER_01]: developing antibodies to the receptors for
acetylcholine that respond to the
[SPEAKER_01]: neuromuscular junction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you develop antibodies, they attack
your own receptors at your neuromuscular
[SPEAKER_01]: junction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the efficacy, the tightness of
connection between your spinal cord
[SPEAKER_01]: telling your muscles to move is degraded
by your own immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of these insidious ways that
autoimmunity fucks us up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people that have myasthenia gravis,
well, it is something that is very easily
[SPEAKER_01]: modeled in a mouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a mouse basically allergic to
their own acetylcholine receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts just like myasthenia gravis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get muscle weakness and progressive
failures because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they showed that giving the mouse a
cannabinoid helps to prevent and treat
[SPEAKER_01]: myasthenia gravis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, clinically, if you have this,
what you will be prescribed is a medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: that helps to enhance the release of
acetylcholine or block its breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: This new discovery is that cannabinoids
acting at CB1 receptors enhances the
[SPEAKER_01]: release of acetylcholine at the
neuromuscular junction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there, here's another of the
limitless examples about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot stand up in front of a group of
doctors and talk about clinical data and
[SPEAKER_01]: say that there's any proof whatsoever that
the use of cannabis, be it a tincture,
[SPEAKER_01]: a pill, a joint, I cannot say that the use
of cannabis can be a treatment for
[SPEAKER_01]: myasthenia gravis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have literally zero clinical evidence
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the biological underpinning has now
been elegantly described that it may be
[SPEAKER_01]: the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping that in this era of new
upstart cannabis companies that I am
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in, these kinds of things can be
dovetailed into studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if not really expensive clinical
trials, patient outcomes, let's recruit
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are using it for myasthenia
gravis and find out, does it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's observational study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as strong as the controlled
clinical trial, but they all start to
[SPEAKER_01]: justify one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we move in that direction,
it'll be easier for us to fund those
[SPEAKER_00]: increased in size studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, this is interesting too,
because while I don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with that particular autoimmune
disease, I work with a lot of other folks
[SPEAKER_00]: with autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most commonly, usually lupus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how these manifest for different
patients is different from patient to
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But decreased mobility is incredibly
common, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that high doses of whole plant
cannabinoids really work to help,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard patients call it loosen the
joints, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To make them feel less like they're
rusting, like the Tin Man and Wizard of
[SPEAKER_00]: Oz, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel like they're loosening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I've never heard this
explanation that you just gave,
[SPEAKER_00]: it certainly seems to be more evidence in
that general direction that adding
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid supplementation to our body
from this plant acts like an oil can on
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that's trying to stop our
mobility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure seems to act in a lot of places
like that, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a redundancy of function that
helps to support these different
[SPEAKER_01]: directions that would enhance mobility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, this piece I'm talking
about, could cannabinoids help to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: the function of your neuromuscular
junction on this subtle way, but a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that could underlie when people were
talking about getting into a flow state,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your neuromuscular connection is just
getting set up and more high fidelity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got the sense of wellness that
comes from the way the endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: are acting in the limbic system of your
brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got the sense of enhanced
bronchodilation that's happening from
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids working on your upper
airways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all fits together in some pretty
fascinating ways, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it certainly does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a matter of fact, I'm thinking to
myself, I'm like, my God, this is like a
[SPEAKER_00]: big commercial for yoga.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like low impact muscle movement of that
kind creating an increase of
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's circle this all the way back
around to the strengthening and building
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle before we move on to different
types of athleticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know a lot about sports
physiology, but my general understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: is that how we're building muscle is that
we rip the muscle and then as our body
[SPEAKER_00]: goes to repair that, it repairs it bigger,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're building muscle mass and
then so you rip it today, you heal
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow, you rip it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's clearly something that is going
to be partially regulated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having the cannabis to help us be present
in the moment is good and to focus so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can lift more weight and have better
form, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the muscular level, how will this
support our building and strengthening of
[SPEAKER_00]: muscles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know that it will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, and that ripping and
tearing is an intrinsic part of that does
[SPEAKER_01]: include inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have talked to a sports physician
who has expressed to me that he thinks the
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-inflammatory actions of the
cannabinoids actually would be working
[SPEAKER_01]: against bulking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, if you're weightlifting to
build mass, that may be contrary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little observation into my own
little circles and use of cannabis related
[SPEAKER_01]: to strength training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't even say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at a molecular level, we don't really
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And me talking about what happens at that
neuromuscular synapse is not really
[SPEAKER_01]: addressing how the tissue is remodeling
during the recovery that can help build
[SPEAKER_01]: mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there would be an interference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how important inflammation is
to the actual mass building that goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an interesting question,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we need some inflammation in
the area, maybe we don't need as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people love cannabis for
recovery, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe, OK, we rip up the muscles,
which causes its repair and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe if the cannabis is decreasing
inflammation X variable amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe that's where we're getting some of
our ease of recovery from these sports.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, again, cannabis isn't just
the endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoid system isn't just a
master regulator of inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much broader than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in many vascular beds,
endocannabinoids act as vasodilators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that may not happen all the time,
but vasodilation is something that is
[SPEAKER_01]: taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, supplements, that is, that are,
for example, nitric oxide donors are taken
[SPEAKER_01]: by weightlifters to improve the amount of
weight you can go, the circulation of
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygenated blood to the tissues is
enhanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe cannabis does that at a level that
is not exaggerated, but supportive of
[SPEAKER_01]: sustained muscle function during training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned cannabinoid receptors on
mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the other kind of supplement that
is really used to boast both performance
[SPEAKER_01]: and recovery are supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supplements like creatine phosphate and
things that will support the regeneration
[SPEAKER_01]: of ATP.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, and this is certainly conjecture on my
part, but if the cannabinoid receptors on
[SPEAKER_01]: mitochondria are involved with making
mitochondria more efficient, maybe that
[SPEAKER_01]: has something to do with replenishing ATP.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very testable question that I
don't think anybody has gotten to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I certainly haven't seen anything on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually leads us right next to
our other, our next category of sports,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is endurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, if we've got receptors on the
mitochondria, we know that the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the efficiency of the creation and
burning of that energy is going to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: way related to the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess it could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't take that as a baton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't sure exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so let's talk about running and
swimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, we clearly talked a lot about
running at the top of the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these, you know, by our using
cannabis, how do you see that for runners
[SPEAKER_00]: and swimmers to add to their overall
training regimen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I just think if it,
if it improves their experience and their
[SPEAKER_01]: adherence to the discipline of their
sport, then it's going to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits of sticking with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it could be of great help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of this could be this aspect of
getting in the zone or combating fatigue
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis can be involved with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I'm saying, there's lots of
cellular molecular basis for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The metabolic benefits that may happen
with using a way of using cannabis and in
[SPEAKER_01]: your life around training may help to
support the kind of changes that again,
[SPEAKER_01]: help to shift you to a different set
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I, my training partner and I,
we've talked about exercise as a vision of
[SPEAKER_01]: homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you push yourself out of your zone
and part of the recurrence of training to
[SPEAKER_01]: get your time better, to get your
endurance better is you're kind of forcing
[SPEAKER_01]: a homeostasis to a different set point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my, you know, my buddy used to
talk about me hitting the red zone because
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, when I first started
training in the gym two years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, since the first time in a long
time, I would work out with my buddy Mike
[SPEAKER_01]: for like 20 minutes and I would be like,
I would be redlining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the act of continuing to train is
really pushing your body into that zone,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I do very much believe we evolved to
get into, but you know, 20 years out of
[SPEAKER_01]: shape is 20 years out of shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to sort of, re-engage
yourself to be adaptive in that set point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there may be some consequence where
you don't feel so good when you go weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: without training.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's another, that's another story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let me, let me ask this question
in a different way too, because I was,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was setting you up because I thought you
were going to tell me that, that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that cannabis can, can help the
performance of swimming and running the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual physicality of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you went to mindset, which makes me
think that maybe my whole direction is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I thought you, you know,
cannabis is considered a endurance sport
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancing drug, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is banned in many sports areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this actually creates this idea in me
that, that maybe it's banned, not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily because it will make you a
better swimmer through the physical act of
[SPEAKER_00]: swimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe the reason why it's sports
enhancing is just because it keeps your
[SPEAKER_00]: head in the game so much more and your
ability to ignore distractions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from the competitor in the next
lane over, you know, maybe that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I was actually, yeah,
huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I do think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I know like the NCAA right
now, it views CBD as a banned substance,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, because it's a schedule one,
but you know, even thinking cogently about
[SPEAKER_01]: it, I've talked to a physician with the
NCAA who's, you know, saying, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an anti-inflammatory and that's
performance enhancing because
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation, that's a wild story because
we're going to stop letting people take
[SPEAKER_01]: ibuprofen beforehand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, that anti-controlling
inflammation that may occur during the
[SPEAKER_01]: course of a distance sport certainly could
help to promote, you know, sticking with
[SPEAKER_01]: the behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the mental focus, the letting
go of grasping, you know, there's a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: other dialogue out there about cannabis
and meditation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and I think there's a
intersect there and that both are,
[SPEAKER_01]: have a relationship to letting go of your
grasping, of your discursive mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helps with getting into a
meditative place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helps with possibly, like you said,
not thinking about the competitor,
[SPEAKER_01]: not thinking about what you look like,
or even being able to forget the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: your ankle isn't feeling very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not like I'm trying to tell people
to push through pain that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that takes me to another little piece
that, you know, when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: why cannabis could be performance
promoting, whether it should be used in
[SPEAKER_01]: sports.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I know we're not primarily talking
about things like head injury,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I was speaking at a conference on
traumatic brain injury a couple months
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I spoke to a fellow who's a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a sports physician at a, at a NCAA
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Works with football players.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, he was talking about the use of
cannabis in sports.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't go down this whole wormhole,
but my feeling is that whether or not
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or CBD, even on the sideline of,
of games could, would be preventing people
[SPEAKER_01]: from serious brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it could, I think it's more a
question of our athletes, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: contact sports.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our athletes should have a absolutely
right to be medicating with this medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: because we should be concerned not with
just getting them back on the field,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with their longevity as human beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think CBD and full spectrum cannabis
products should be part, should be allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: and supported by professional athletics
because it helps to promote the longevity
[SPEAKER_01]: and health and wellbeing of the athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question of whether they can get
back on the field real quickly and earn
[SPEAKER_01]: their paycheck is not the one that the
medical profession should be focused on as
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a big cultural shift to,
to shift our view of, of sports players
[SPEAKER_00]: from entertainers to humans and,
and have some kind of interest in their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their longevity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like being aware of them as a
human instead of.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hang out with a group of 55 year
old NFL players, they're, they're nearly
[SPEAKER_01]: near the end of their natural life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were like on the offensive line,
those guys don't have a long life
[SPEAKER_01]: expectancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times, even with a lot of
wealth, it's not very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I don't want to roll this up in a
whole different conversation, but that is
[SPEAKER_01]: something I feel powerfully about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's talk about the, the last of
the three categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about strengthening and building
muscles, endurance sports, like swimming
[SPEAKER_00]: and running, um, for myself, I play
racquetball and, uh, I absolutely know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I play differently with a little bit
of THC, um, in my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, if I, if I smoked it,
it may actually decrease my, my breath a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, cause I happen to have asthma,
but I swear I've got like a sixth sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: where the ball is going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the physics better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I, I attempt and succeed more
aggressively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so like, what's, what's your take
on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just, am I getting more creative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I just more, less averse to risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like, like what about these
dexterity and mobility based sports where
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to visualize where a sport action
is going to take place and then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, the fun part about all of this is
that because the endocannabinoids and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the receptors that cannabis
works on are so everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the brain, then you can just think
about the neuroscience of performance and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and think, well, cannabis could totally
influence that all the ways you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, whether it influences you with
greater risk taking or sort of sensory
[SPEAKER_01]: motor visual performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, I certainly do have a way to
consider this in that, um, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the neural circuits in our brain and
spinal cord that are involved with
[SPEAKER_01]: executing motor behavior are worse than
some of the greatest expressions of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid receptors are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that the learning and
unlearning of behavioral habits are
[SPEAKER_01]: involved, involve endocannabinoid
signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, I look at the cerebellum,
the cerebellum is part of the brain that
[SPEAKER_01]: sits in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually the name means little brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is anybody who studied a brain function
knows that the cerebellum is involved with
[SPEAKER_01]: coordination and timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and in clinical symptoms of ataxia,
various forms of ataxia and dis
[SPEAKER_01]: coordinated, um, symptoms are related to
cerebellar damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cerebellum, what it does on a neural
circuit level simplified is it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's constantly processing where your body
is in space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's actually happening with your
body using input from what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: proprioceptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you close your eyes and raise your
hand, you can feel very much where your
[SPEAKER_01]: body is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the proprioceptive input is telling
your brain and it's going through the
[SPEAKER_01]: cerebellum to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cerebellum is not only constantly
measuring where you, what your body's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually doing, but it is comparing it
with what you intend to do and what you
[SPEAKER_01]: expect to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these things like the angle of
the racket ball, the angle of the ball
[SPEAKER_01]: coming back off the wall, how you
integrate that with the way, the velocity
[SPEAKER_01]: with which you saw it hitting the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how hard your opponent hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard the sound of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw where on the, you've got where it
hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a memory of how your opponent
throws a wicked spin on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those kinds of things build a
projection in your mind of where that ball
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to get there, you have to coordinate
what your body's actually doing with what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're expecting and what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: In real time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the neuroscience of this is
very, of course it's fascinating and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very mainstream to think that our heads
and our brains evolved to make these kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of computations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the endocannabinoids are really
involved with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the cerebellar cortex where a lot of
the circuitry is involved, every single
[SPEAKER_01]: synapse is regulated by endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that route, it's not surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And much of the research has looked at how
does weed impair you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not surprising that high doses of THC
will gum up your coordination.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's absolutely a way to
overdo it and take so much that your is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to impact your game negatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if a judicious, you know, more micro
sort of dosing of cannabis helps you get
[SPEAKER_01]: in your game and feel that there's all
kinds of biological rationale for why that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are forms of very laboratory
controlled cerebellar learning in animals
[SPEAKER_01]: that are dependent on cannabinoid
receptors to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't happen as well when you don't
have the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's part of the,
I guess, to step back from that a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit to segue into what would be like a
broader sort of gestalt of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this conversation, other conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I speculate a lot about how cannabis could
enhance performance, because I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: underlying neurobiology and physiology is
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also because there aren't very many
people in the world who worked with these
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic knockouts earlier than I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about mice that don't have CB1
cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been studying that sort of genetic
study system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not in the lab 24 seven now,
but then it's not about my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is the data show us over and
over again, lots of different labs that
[SPEAKER_01]: animals, mammals that don't have CB1
cannabinoid receptors live lives that are
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter, more inflammation prone,
more seizure prone, more metabolically
[SPEAKER_01]: messed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, they're prone to early deaths,
all these kinds of things, and they run
[SPEAKER_01]: less.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: CB1 knockout mice are less prone to
running on an exercise wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's part of how our brains evolved for
endocannabinoids to be master tuners of
[SPEAKER_01]: the rhythms of our brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Endocannabinoids help to tune them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when and where and how the compounds
in cannabis might improve that in a
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial way, that has to shake out
empirically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're an N of one and using
cannabis a little bit helps you improve
[SPEAKER_01]: your game, I think that is every bit as
believable and justifiable, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: explainable as it is to say that Louis
Armstrong was better playing trumpet when
[SPEAKER_01]: he was a little bit high.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to speak for a past revered
musician who we know used cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've been around a lot of musicians in
my life who again, you can overdo it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that it also can play a role in your
motor performance, your dexterity and what
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have any clinical data to say
you're going to be a better guitar player
[SPEAKER_01]: or racquetball player by microdosing
cannabis first.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this this science does help us
understand better who we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I've learned from healers of
all stripes, whether they are accepted by
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical establishment or not,
is that the story we tell ourselves
[SPEAKER_01]: matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our perspectives on healing matters,
our perspective on optimum performance
[SPEAKER_01]: matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are systems of our body that help to
promote that, that we can access the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system being a master
player among them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a plant that helps us interact
with that endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a reason why it has been
revered across human culture since before
[SPEAKER_01]: human language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's let's let's pause there and go to
our last commercial break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we come back, we'll talk
about a whole bunch of variables to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Greg Gerdeman, chief
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific officer at Three Boys Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a listener of Shaping Fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant's roots zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil, phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: by out competing potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea was developed at a US
university and has been extensively tested
[SPEAKER_00]: by Colorado growers and independent
laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy mammoth pea near you, check out
[SPEAKER_00]: their website at www.mammothmicrobes.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partner with microorganisms to create
beautiful, thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you know that Shaping Fire has a
fabulous YouTube channel with content not
[SPEAKER_00]: found on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I attend conventions or speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: Joudry of Wonderland Nursery talking about
breeding cannabis for the best terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile, Nicholas Mahmood on regenerative
and polyculture cannabis growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Sunil Agrawal on the history of
cannabis medicine around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben Cassidy of True Terpenes on using
terpenes for health in your everyday life,
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie Gaudino of Steep Hill on the
cannabis genome, and Jeff Lowenfels on the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, and even my own
presentation on how to approach finding
[SPEAKER_00]: your dream job in cannabis and why we
choose cannabis business even though the
[SPEAKER_00]: risks are so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of today, there are over 100 videos

or click on the link in this week's
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Greg Gerdeman, Chief
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientific Officer at Three Boys Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Greg, let's take a step back from the
specifics of sports physiology and let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about cardiovascular health because
even people who are not actively working
[SPEAKER_00]: out or playing a part Thank you so much
for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the part that I always remember is
they talk about him getting high and then
[SPEAKER_00]: playing basketball and they're waiting for
him to drop dead on the court,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somewhere, that got put in my brain
that whenever I'm working out and more
[SPEAKER_00]: endurance stuff and my heart starts
pounding and I'm high, I always just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of in the back of my mind think I'm just
gonna drop over dead and I don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been to my doctor and she's all
like, no, you're not at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, she won't approve a stress test
for me so I can make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's like, there's no reason for you
to be concerned about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, but the beastie boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't get me anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about cardiovascular health,
because that's one of the worst things in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can our use of cannabis help us to
have healthy hearts that won't crap out on
[SPEAKER_00]: us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, if it helps to in the ways
we've been talking about to promote
[SPEAKER_01]: exercise, there's a indirect thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I certainly don't want to come across
like cannabis being a magic pill towards
[SPEAKER_01]: better heart health.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's good measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think public health outcomes from survey
basis that cannabis users are in general
[SPEAKER_01]: tend towards better health.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are concerns around
cardiovascular issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it could be that cannabis,
this is a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stutter because this is a place where
the human observation in what I've talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about, like with better body mass index,
for example, doesn't exactly line up with
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the concerns that have been raised
in animal research that there's greater
[SPEAKER_01]: fat deposition, for example, that part of
what the CB1 cannabinoids receptor does is
[SPEAKER_01]: not only promote feeding behavior,
but it helps promote the storage of fats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the storage of fats helps to create
metabolic cardiovascular risk,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, then maybe that would be some
indication against high CHC for chronic
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There hasn't been, in my view,
big red flags about cardiac risk or long
[SPEAKER_01]: term cardiac improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see more stuff about breaking
down cannabis users and controlled studies
[SPEAKER_01]: and looking at real cardiovascular
performance profiles, whether it's heart
[SPEAKER_01]: rate variability or ejection fraction and
under stress, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know that, again, it is animal
research, but a study that was published
[SPEAKER_01]: very prominently a few years ago out of
Germany showed that in mice, which do get
[SPEAKER_01]: atherosclerosis, and that's like the
hardening of the arteries that is sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: the primary risk factor and predictor of
larger cardiovascular disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: in mice, especially if fed a Western diet,
atherosclerosis absolutely happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in mice that were fed daily really low
doses of THC, the severity of
[SPEAKER_01]: atherosclerosis and plaque formation
related to it was significantly reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this was like published in Nature,
a top scientific journal in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very low dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something like 0.01 milligrams per
kilogram, which is very low for an animal
[SPEAKER_01]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it showed reduced atherosclerosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean like a low dose sort of
wellness level, regular cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption could help limit
atherosclerosis, which is leading to
[SPEAKER_01]: coronary vascular disease, number one
killer?
[SPEAKER_01]: It might, whether you smoke it or ingest
it in some other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should speak, if we're talking about
cardiovascular health, about the worry for
[SPEAKER_01]: adverse outcomes in that smoking cannabis,
taking THC does lead to an increased heart
[SPEAKER_01]: rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clinically, we'll call it tachycardia.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a transient tachycardia increased
heart rate that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's part of what supports panic
attacks when people have taken more than
[SPEAKER_01]: they were expecting or knew how to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that edible starts kicking in in the
second hour and you took way too much and
[SPEAKER_01]: your heart starts racing, that as can
create a negative spiral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it is transient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even within sort of low dose sessions,
you adjust to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people who have emergent
cardiovascular disease or may be at a high
[SPEAKER_01]: risk of stroke, for example, because they
know they've got the potential for clots,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're taking medicines for that,
then they should be cautious around going
[SPEAKER_01]: too high with THC because there are people
who can suffer a stroke or a cardiac
[SPEAKER_01]: incident simply from having an increased
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that is a side effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something for people to recognize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when we published our exercise study
showing that the runner's joy is related
[SPEAKER_01]: to endocannabinoid signaling, maybe it was
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd certainly talk to people who asked me,
all right, so somebody wanting to get back
[SPEAKER_01]: to exercise can be happy about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're someone who's recovering
from a heart attack and you are not used
[SPEAKER_01]: to jogging, you don't want to just boost
that with a hit off a joint and then go
[SPEAKER_01]: run without taking some consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even that said, I mean, there's not strong
clinical data that people are at increased
[SPEAKER_01]: risks of heart attacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there have been some studies to
suggest that patients who there have been
[SPEAKER_01]: some clinical findings of patient with
stroke with a heart attack who had been
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking beforehand and that cause and
effect in those incidences may be related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always been my understanding or
belief, I guess, because I don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of evidence for this, is that the
reason why the heart rate increases with
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking THC or I guess if you're taking
enough edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is, is that it drops my
blood pressure, which causes the heart to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to pump faster to make up for the
dropping of the blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is that scientifically accurate or
is that just a myth that I grabbed onto?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that makes sense in that it can
because it vasodilates, it can drop your
[SPEAKER_01]: blood pressure and that can create exactly
that with with lower blood returning to
[SPEAKER_01]: the heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will compensate by increasing the rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also works in the in the autonomic
control of the heartbeat itself and and
[SPEAKER_01]: can create a transient increase in heart
rate, even if you're sitting down,
[SPEAKER_01]: which shouldn't really be accompanied with
too much problems from blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do take, you know,
THC based tinctures to lower their blood
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that to get that lowering of
the blood pressure, it necessitates also
[SPEAKER_00]: having the increase of heart rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of, you know, I was under the
general idea that the pounding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: heart rate was more related to particular
terpene profiles and the excitement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: adrenals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but then also I know about this other
decreasing of the blood pressure aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really sure how that dynamic
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I I think if somebody said they were
sure about it, they'd be pulling your leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot that hasn't been studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like I mean, you're bringing in the
adrenals and the release of epinephrine
[SPEAKER_01]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I don't think anybody really
knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I too, you know, there hasn't been a
real well controlled study that I know of
[SPEAKER_01]: just looking at changes in resting blood
pressure in people who might be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sort of baseline hypertensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have, again, with just these
clinical anecdotal findings of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: who have found success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to many people over the years
who are like, I started using cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: X, Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my physician came back to me and said,
your blood pressure is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and is that clinical evidence?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, not at the standard that
that we tend to operate when we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about medicines and improving medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a clinical outcome that I've seen
that I've heard discussed, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a repeated way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to know if if cannabis use
can increase and lower the blood pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: of someone who's running high,
I'd sure love to help find out who
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits in that way and win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there if there are variations in
terpene constituents that play a role in
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that's perfectly conceivable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even, you know, there you get into
that whole new angle of terpenes and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of their mechanisms of function are far
from clear in the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's judiciously said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are effective, exquisitely low
concentrations a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people say things like,
oh, mercy and helps THC cross the blood
[SPEAKER_01]: brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is speculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not good data to show those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so far today, we've talked about
using cannabis in a lot of different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to help your human body in a bunch of
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, cannabis can be ingested by
different methods, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's there's combustion smoking
or a vape pen or my favorite tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on, you know,
the best mode to ingest cannabinoids based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the different goals we've been talking
about today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the bottom line is always going to
be that it depends on the person and how
[SPEAKER_01]: things respond and work well for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are if you're wanting a rapid
mode of action, you know, that maybe it's
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly if you're talking about
breakthrough symptom control, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today we're trying to talk about
performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, back to our earlier talk,
you know, if you want to sort of find a
[SPEAKER_01]: place that you become familiar with,
that's a good zone for your fitness than a
[SPEAKER_01]: fast onset like a vape or vaping oil,
vaping flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking a hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be what is most effective for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and if you're not scared of cannabis,
maybe the kind of thing to suggest first,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can get a better sense of,
yeah, this is how quickly this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But tinctures and sublingual application
can certainly come on pretty fast,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a big fan, like you said,
of tinctures and sublingual oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in both for even even I mean,
I'm a growing fan of of the
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the raw acids, I think they're
highly underestimated and that people
[SPEAKER_01]: could be popping those in tinctures to
great health benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it would improve performance,
not sure, but it is a quick mode of
[SPEAKER_01]: action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then when you've got again
thinking back about performance and
[SPEAKER_01]: mobility back to my story of a buddy who
long ago told me that they would eat
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles and go on a run.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who have the kind of sport that
involves endurance, some sort of edible
[SPEAKER_01]: product might be what they find works to
help prolong their zone, their,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, flow state if they get their
block and maybe through the mechanism I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned earlier, maybe there's a way to
help prevent muscle fatigue or promote
[SPEAKER_01]: muscle function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know, it does come down to what
people empirically find works for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, anyway, and I'd love to
I'd love to see a day where we've got some
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger repeatability and then I can give
more recommendations to the naive user.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now I would be cautious about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we talk a lot about
individualized medicine on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that that this feels a lot
like the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, OK, for me, I may like to use a
one to one THC and CBD tincture for
[SPEAKER_00]: overall endocannabinoid health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after workout healing from from,
you know, running into the wall of the
[SPEAKER_00]: racquetball court and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I'm going to go lift and I really
want to be in the moment, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'm going to, you know, take a small
hit off my one hitter, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of a little bubble hat or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I guess that really is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I guess the point here is for to
encourage folks to not assume that all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these solutions are going to be inhaled
based and make sure that you consider the
[SPEAKER_00]: range of modalities that we've got now,
which is the most anybody's ever had in
[SPEAKER_00]: human history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so don't don't feel like it has to be
smoking, just like when you explain to
[SPEAKER_00]: patients that they don't have to smoke
only kind of blows their mind a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we haven't even talked about
topicals in this performance piece,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that is I do tend to think more in
terms of very local inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are different all kinds of
different modes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when we're talking about
sublingual oils, I mean, some dissolvable
[SPEAKER_01]: strip might be very effective as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's I'm not going to go
out proselytizing to people about that
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing cannabis in life into their life
is going to make everything or make make
[SPEAKER_01]: it all better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people are using and enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel like cannabis increases their quality
of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to bring that into
supporting a physical fitness routine,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, do that, because it might help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so safe to experiment with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about don't think that you're just
limited to taking a hit off a joint before
[SPEAKER_01]: you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But try it takes your 15 minutes before
you start working out and see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might don't don't gauge whether it's
working by whether you feel high gauge,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's working with whether you
worked out well and feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't take anything away from us to put
value on the medicine, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: by saying, oh, the medicine helped me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't take anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You helped yourself by using a plant
product that you that works with how you
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, the story that we tell
each other ourselves matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a video that I recently put on the
shaping fire YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a running a series there right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second shaping fire sessions I did was
with Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was with Kevin Jodry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Ethan is very adamant that
there is a great deal of cannabis efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: below the intoxication mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many people think that you need to
get high to get the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, anti-inflammatory is a
great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, serious anti-inflammatory
patients will take two point five
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams every three to four hours
throughout the day and be at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got active cannabinoids,
including THC in their bloodstream all day
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet they don't feel anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've learned a lot from Ethan in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I parrot him quite a lot here in
Florida, where we've got, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me tell you, it's hard to go to a
dispensary as they exist in Florida and
[SPEAKER_01]: find those low dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to be able to take something
really easy at a two point five milligram
[SPEAKER_01]: level repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The companies that play in Florida are
more interested in higher dose products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm not dismissing high
dose and that that's valuable medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got its place, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but no, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to titrate the feeling
high, but to improvement, whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about symptom management or in
this case, we're taking it to a different
[SPEAKER_01]: level of wellness performance,
you know, improving, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: functionality and mobility and helping us
live our best selves, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you what do you think about these
CBD isolate vape pens that we're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to see, you know, you know, sports people,
you know, hitting on during press
[SPEAKER_00]: conferences and stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know I know that generally
you're a whole plant guy like I am,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That we that, you know, we want to use the
whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're so in vogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that there are people who are
listening to the show because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, cannabis and exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then their sports heroes are like
pushing or being a coming attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: these CBD isolate pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, like, I think that isolate,
you know, unless unless you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: your whole plant somewhere else and you're
just spiking your your regular daily use
[SPEAKER_00]: with some extra CBD isolate using CBD
isolate on its own doesn't sound like a
[SPEAKER_00]: great idea to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's see, there's I don't want to
disparage any athlete stepping out
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting CBD in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I I I've really enjoyed meeting
some great athletes in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I I praise them for coming out and
helping normalize it because nobody helps
[SPEAKER_01]: to normalize the conversation better than
these athletes that we really as a society
[SPEAKER_01]: tend to worship, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And and it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBD is a great compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I it's it's amazing how things
have shifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for us to be dismissing CBD in any
way, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because CBD is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the isolate that that's not what
I want to be involved in developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not ever going to be my first choice
as a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got to be cut with other agents
because CBD by that I mean diluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something else in a vape pen than
CBD because CBD doesn't stay in solution
[SPEAKER_01]: very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you talk to people in the
business and they might they might say
[SPEAKER_01]: something like it sugars out or it
crystals up or what they're meaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes out of solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and that that CBD does that very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there will be something else added
to help it dissolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something you're breathing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm cautious about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm not trying to dismiss any
athletes, but I also know that the CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: market is booming because there's it's
it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there's huge interest going into the
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, some subset of athletes,
I mean, companies seek them out to give
[SPEAKER_01]: them these endorsement opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, again, that sounds like I'm
speaking negatively about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's more as a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the only reason that CBD
isolate got so hot in the first place is
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's an artificial market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got we still have got federal
prohibition of whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and for the moment, you know,
CBD isolate is only being selectively
[SPEAKER_00]: enforced by the federal government based
on the claims that you're making from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it's schedule one,
they're not actually going around the
[SPEAKER_00]: country and busting people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're busting people is for saying
you cannot say that CBD will solve your
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever your issue is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not busting people for having
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If if we had federal whole plant legal
everywhere, CBD isolate would just
[SPEAKER_00]: disappear because whole plant was so much
more effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's artificial prohibitions on it
and therefore thus CBD isolate world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much cannabis, you know,
so call them type three cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties, hemp varieties, whatever that
are CBD producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know very well, there's so much
growing now in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the boom and that CBD isolate
is because it's been imported in mass in
[SPEAKER_01]: huge volumes, not as hemp flower,
but as you know, this first extract sludge
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes in from so many different
places and gets them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: refined and distilled down into CBD and
there's a for all these market reasons it
[SPEAKER_01]: exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're living in a space where,
you know, grocery stores and health food
[SPEAKER_01]: stores are talking about selling CBD
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in CVS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Urban Outfitters is the last one I
read today is going to start carrying CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that they are oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope there's so much growing now and a
market to support farmers that are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and having a good farming life that whole
spectrum are fuller, less processed oils
[SPEAKER_01]: that isn't taken down to the powder and
sold around as a molecular commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep, you know, let's keep cannabis
flower and cannabis extract oils as the
[SPEAKER_01]: health and wellness and supplement
commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just boiling it down to molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, I'm as classically
trained molecular pharmacology guys you
[SPEAKER_01]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but that's where I stand with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is another great
place for us to plug home growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, find, find a chemo bar
that you like grow it in your backyard or
[SPEAKER_00]: over the summer, make your own tincture or
smoke it yourself and know exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm never going to speak against home
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I've been paid by entrance by
entities that, you know, want to have more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a market control, but whether it's a
medicine or, you know, I just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have the human right to access
this plant and nothing makes it more
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible than having a plant that you
tend and learning from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm not against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Greg, thank you so much for sharing
your vast experience with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, you've got this unique
combination where, you know, all these
[SPEAKER_00]: years teaching anatomy and physiology,
but then also your, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid research, you provided a
great entree to this, this nexus is a
[SPEAKER_00]: nexus of ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for taking your time
and, and, and joining us and being on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.

episode 14, all about synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and Greg breaks down what the heck
these things are and why they are not
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally occurring cannabinoids and why
they are so much more dangerous for the
[SPEAKER_00]: human body.

cannabinoids, which are not dangerous at
