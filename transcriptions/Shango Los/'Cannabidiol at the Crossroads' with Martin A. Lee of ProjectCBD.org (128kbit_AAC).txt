[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to figure out how this works
before I do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we are in the midst of a major
pro-Canada's cultural shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might call it a surge in our society,
and I think CBD and Abedal has been a big
[SPEAKER_02]: part of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet, 10 years ago, very few people knew
anything about CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a well-known compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't really part of the medical
marijuana experience in California and
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aside from a relatively small number of
scientists, it really wasn't on anybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yesterday, we had this huge explosion
in interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in California, you can get CBD in gas
stations, even though it's not technically
[SPEAKER_02]: legal to do that in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, in that sense, it's not unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all over the country like that in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think what I'd like to do is focus a
little bit on the history of some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: current scientific and therapeutic
developments and also look at the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, when we first rediscovered some of
the CBD-rich drugs, which are very
[SPEAKER_02]: strange, as we called them back in 2009 in
Northern California, we had a sense right
[SPEAKER_02]: away, because we knew about CBD from
scientific literature, that this could
[SPEAKER_02]: have a major impact on the medical
marijuana community and the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not simply because CBD had a great deal of
therapeutic potential, according to the
[SPEAKER_02]: extensive animal studies and some
pre-clinical work and some clinical work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, also, we had a sense at the time that
CBD, because it's not toxicating,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's not subtracted like THC,
and I always add the like THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: because CBD is a mood changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't get you stoned, but it is a
mood changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be anti-depressing, anti-anxiety,
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, we suspected at the time that this
could be a real game-changer in that it
[SPEAKER_02]: could help to liberate cannabis from the
drug abuse paradigm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, right away, we sensed back in 2009,
the group that ended up forming Project
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD, that it could have a major influence,
even above and beyond what it might do for
[SPEAKER_02]: someone therapeutically, that it could
influence the social landscape as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think our intuition has been born
out, although in some ways, observing or
[SPEAKER_02]: watching as the whole CBD narrative is
unfolding, while it's been very exciting
[SPEAKER_02]: and amazing and remarkable, it's also been
somewhat disconcerting.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some ways, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things we didn't expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just to start now with the early
history, and we're gonna move through
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly, because we don't have that much
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD was first isolated from a hemp plant
by Roger Adams, a University of Illinois
[SPEAKER_02]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, in 1963, Rafael Mishulin,
the eminent Israeli chemist, he
[SPEAKER_02]: synthesized CBD, he elucidated its
chemical structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, at that time, there wasn't really a
lot of research that followed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the focus was on THC, if anything,
because THC got in Ohio, and it was the
[SPEAKER_02]: concern, and it was the interest of most
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a little bit of research,
some in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brazil, for some reason, has always been
ahead of the curve with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1980, there was an interesting study
that showed CBD had strong anti-seizure
[SPEAKER_02]: properties, but it was a relatively small
number of people involved in that
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't really go anywhere, for some
reason, even though it showed it had
[SPEAKER_02]: significant anti-seizure potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big breakthrough in 1988, when the CBD1
receptor was discovered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Rousseau has talked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stimulated a great deal of research
that would follow from this very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very exciting research that would have
major implications for medical science and
[SPEAKER_02]: how we understand human physiology and
human biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: That also triggered more interest in CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: A key study in 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: government-funded study.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was published in the Procedure of the
National Academy of Sciences in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very prestigious study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four authors, one of whom was a Nobel
Prize winner, a Nobel laureate,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jewish Axelrod.
[SPEAKER_02]: The study concluded that both CBD and THC
were powerful antioxidants that had strong
anti-seizure properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strong neuroprotective properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: This research has been misportrayed by,
I think, some of the CBD hemp companies as
[SPEAKER_02]: having laid the basis for a patent on CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: government patent 2003 based on the
research into THC and CBD, not just CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be familiar with cannabinoids
have been found referring to THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have antioxidant properties,
have particular application as
[SPEAKER_02]: neuroprotectants, for example,
limiting neurological damages following
[SPEAKER_02]: ischemic insults such as stroke and
trauma, or in the treatment of during
[SPEAKER_02]: degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's, and HIV dementia.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: government speaking from one side of its
mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other side of its mouth is this is a
dangerous drug with no medical value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we have a study from 2016 published
in the U.K., Philosophical Transactions of
[SPEAKER_02]: the Royal Society.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's talking about, again, the
neuroprotective properties of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The research, again, based on CBD and
other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see in red summarizing
cannabinoids protect neurons on the
[SPEAKER_02]: molecular level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normal brain aging and neurodegenerative
diseases are suppressed by cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very powerful, sort of anti-aging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet, it's been known for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a slide I have to give credit to
Dr. Russo based on a relatively recent
[SPEAKER_02]: translation of the ancient Chinese
pharmacopeia in which talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal hemp, you see, protracted taking
may make one fat, strong, and never
[SPEAKER_02]: senile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somehow, we're just catching up to the
ancient Chinese.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a common theme here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to repeat too much what Dr. Russo
said, but just to summarize quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does cannabis work?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have plant cannabinoids that mimic the
effects and augment the effects on
[SPEAKER_02]: endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Endogenous cannabinoids are part of the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to spend too much time on
these slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get to CBD, but because CBD and
THC interact with the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system in different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't repeat the things that Dr. Russo
has said, so we'll skip to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea is that the endocannabinoid
system is dysregulated in almost all
[SPEAKER_02]: disease states in one way or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dysregulation might be an expression
of a deficiency or an expression of an
[SPEAKER_02]: excess if you're dealing with obesity or
certain inflammatory conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: diabetes, liver disease, heart disease,
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving along, I don't want to repeat
again all the information, but three key
[SPEAKER_02]: components to keep in mind as we turn now
to CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: The receptors, cannabinoid receptors,
the endogenous compounds that bind to
[SPEAKER_02]: these receptors, and then various proteins
we have in the body that kind of modulate
[SPEAKER_02]: the level of the endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk more about that in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now CBD in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is known as a promiscuous compound
because it does so many different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to a study published last year,
the author was a Mayo Clinic doctor from
[SPEAKER_02]: Minnesota, eminent medical institution.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that CBD interacts with over 65
different targets in the brain and body.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can probably add to that more easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: These new discoveries are being made all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you take CBD, you're not just
getting one receptor and turning it on and
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many different things are going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the key thing is that unlike THC,
CBD has little direct binding affinity for
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_02]: But CBD does bind to many different
receptors other than the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And CBD also acts in many different
receptor-independent channels or pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at some of the receptors that
CBD binds to, one of the key ones is the
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin receptors, a 5-HT1A receptor
that mediates experience of anxiety,
[SPEAKER_02]: nausea, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD binds very powerfully to this
receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might add that CBDA, the raw version of
CBD, before it's actually heated or
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylated, that actually has more
potent affinity for this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly enough, CBD also binds to
the serotonin 5-H2A receptor, the same
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor that LSD and psilocybin bind to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a panel on psychedelic
medicine later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk more about that and what the
significance is on that panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD binds to many receptors in what's
called the TRIP family of receptors,
[SPEAKER_02]: TRP, TRPV.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole bunch of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, and so forth and so
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these receptors mediate a very kind of
primal, sensory type of experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very ancient receptor system
that seems to be sort of overlaps and
[SPEAKER_02]: intertwines with the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that scientists found
recently is that CBD downregulates genes
[SPEAKER_02]: that are linked to Alzheimer's via this
TRPV1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: By binding to it, it's changing gene
expression of the gene linked to
[SPEAKER_02]: Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just an example of what scientists are
finding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have PPAR receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are receptors that are on the
surface of the nucleus of the cell,
[SPEAKER_02]: not on the outside, as the other receptors
I just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD binds to one of the PPARs also.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very significant therapeutic
implications of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can regulate gene expression and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's many orphan receptors that we
read about in the scientific literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hear about new ones every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: GPR, gene, a couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have different numbers attached to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD, it turns out, binds to many of these
receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: GPR55 is identified a few years ago
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's involved in regulating bone density.
[SPEAKER_02]: When GPR55 is activated, it's associated
with cancer cell proliferation.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is an antagonist, meaning it binds to
this receptor, GPR55, but blocks it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which might be one of the ways that CBD
has an anti-cancer effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have other receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned the glycine receptor here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point is, there are a lot of different
receptors that CBD is interacting with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Curiously, not the cannabinoid receptor,
at least not directly like TNC.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other neurotransmitters that CBD
interacts with that influences levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: these neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: GABAA, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: GABA is the main inhibitory
neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: What CBD does, it makes the GABAA receptor
function more powerfully or better.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you take CBD, your own GABA will have
more of an effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one way that CBD might have an
anxiolytic or anxiety-reducing effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The GABA receptor, that's where valium
hits, that's where alcohol and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will relax you if that's activated.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also the new and delta opioid
receptors that CBD interacts with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adenosine, very important compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is a reuptake inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll explain that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it acts the same way for
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: By reuptake inhibition, we mean that it
will delay the breakdown and reuptake of
[SPEAKER_02]: adenosine, and also of endogenous
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really cool and very interesting
area that I want to focus on for a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2009, scientists from Stony Brook
University in New York discovered that the
[SPEAKER_02]: endogenous cannabinoids, particularly
anandamide, are transported by certain
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules they call fatty acid binding
proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Endogenous cannabinoids are like the plant
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fatty, they're lipids,
they're oily, they're sticky, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mix too well with the blood
because blood is watery.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it work that our endogenous
cannabinoids get to where they need to go
[SPEAKER_02]: or do what they need to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because they hitch a ride on these
transport molecules called fatty acid
[SPEAKER_02]: binding proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can think of it kind of almost like a
little canoe that takes these ...
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, where it takes it is through the
cell membrane, inside the cell,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you also have an aqueous interior,
where the endogenous cannabinoids do lots
[SPEAKER_02]: of important, interesting things until
they're broken down and decommissioned
[SPEAKER_02]: inside the cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in 2015, the same group of
scientists at Stony Brook New York
[SPEAKER_02]: discovered that these same fatty acid
binding proteins were not only carriers of
[SPEAKER_02]: endogenous cannabinoids but of plant
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because the CBD in particular,
which tends to be taken in higher doses
[SPEAKER_02]: than TNC, so I'll talk about CBD in this
context, you have limited space in that
[SPEAKER_02]: little canoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD gets the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a privilege, as you would.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a competition in terms of
getting the space on that fatty acid
[SPEAKER_02]: binding protein between CBD and an
endogenous cannabinoid, CBD gets on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It prevents the endogenous cannabinoids
from going inside the cell to do what they
[SPEAKER_02]: need to do to be conditioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It delays the decommissioning or
deactivation of the endogenous
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that means is they're hanging around
the brain longer, and the more endogenous
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids are in the brain,
the more receptors are going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: signaling in a way that has generally
health positive benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever you smoke weed, whenever you
take pure CBD or a mixture of oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: you are in essence, potentially at least,
activating your own endogenous
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids when you're doing that as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's part of the experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's enhancing
endocannabinoid tone via reuptake
[SPEAKER_02]: inhibition may be a key mechanism where by
CBD and THC confirmed neuroprotection and
[SPEAKER_02]: other health benefits by boosting our own
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an area that's kind of a hot
area now in cannabinoid science,
[SPEAKER_02]: because another thing that's been learned
is that this fatty acid binding protein is
[SPEAKER_02]: over a dozen different ones, and they're
all specific to different areas of the
[SPEAKER_02]: body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a scientist can create a compound
that essentially does what CBD does,
[SPEAKER_02]: that this places the endogenous
cannabinoid, will raise the level of the
[SPEAKER_02]: endogenous cannabinoid as a result.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they can do so targeting specific
areas of the body, which you can't really
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you smoke marijuana, it's a full on
assault or pleasure or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing with other ways that
scientists have been looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can somehow adjust the levels of
the cannabinoids in the body, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you can have greater health effects
if you can boost your endogenous
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it lacks specificity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you focus in this area, there's some
real interesting potential for
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical development here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not a big fan of big pharma,
but we should recognize that there's some
[SPEAKER_02]: value here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing, because we're talking
about cell membranes and passing through
[SPEAKER_02]: the cell membrane, that means that the
quality of the cell membrane, the health
[SPEAKER_02]: of the cell membrane, is it too rigid,
is it too porous, is it too permeable,
[SPEAKER_02]: will have a key impact on this whole
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And diet, it's all about diet and the diet
we eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cholesterol is a very important
element in the cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Healthy fats are really, really key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Omega 3s and so forth for healthy
membranes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So artisanal CBD, we've been talking about
the science of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the grassroots.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned, if I did mention it,
we rediscovered some of these strains in
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern California in 2003.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2009, initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these early strains that we
rediscovered were generally what is called
[SPEAKER_02]: now the type 2 cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't speak so much in terms of indicum
sativa these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: We speak in terms of type 1, high THC,
low CBD, type 2 mixed, type 3 high CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: low THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So initially, the strains that we
rediscovered were the type 2 mixtures,
[SPEAKER_02]: very interesting strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also eventually, the ACDC is that type 3,
high CBD, low THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some ways, it's a bit unfortunate,
because that's kind of got a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: attention, because people are growing
these plants now basically to harvest them
[SPEAKER_02]: for CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we are missing some real
valuable opportunities with these type 2
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, these very interesting blends of
CBD and THC together, which are 1 to 1,
[SPEAKER_02]: 3 to 2, or whatever in ratios,
depending on who you're harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because there's been so much interest
in CBD, per se, I think we'll have to
[SPEAKER_02]: return to those plants, because there's a
lot of value there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big change, a big tipping point in 2013,
the program on CNN that really lit
[SPEAKER_02]: everything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a huge impact, certainly from our
perspective in California, because all of
[SPEAKER_02]: a sudden, CBD is in great demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't before, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's limited within the medical marijuana
milieu, and even just limited within that
[SPEAKER_02]: venue itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all of a sudden, people are hearing
about and seeing on TV these miraculous
[SPEAKER_02]: outputs, and this great deal of interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that combination of not intoxicating,
but great medicinal value was just
[SPEAKER_02]: irresistible for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has spurred a huge increase in the
number of folks interested in cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this whole idea of healing without
the high, the idea that CBD can neutralize
[SPEAKER_02]: THC psychoactivity, depending how much of
each is in the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: While it's significant, I think in some
ways it misses the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is important that people have
options and can get cannabis products that
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't psychoactive like THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very important to have that option.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what it's really all about is managing
psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because from our perspective, without
getting into every condition or every
[SPEAKER_02]: detail, if you have both THC and CBD,
it'll probably help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a matter of just having both
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the question is how much of each?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not so much a matter of,
well, what's the right ratio for the
[SPEAKER_02]: condition?
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's been our experience thus
far in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't match ratios to conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We match ratios to what people are
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea is as much THC along with the CBD
that a person is comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we focus on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a person's sensitivity to THC is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the medical use of cannabis really
depends, at least initially, to a large
[SPEAKER_02]: degree on managing its psychoactive
properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly, we just published a report
yesterday on the Project CBD website,
[SPEAKER_02]: an extensive report on cannabinoids and
drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things we learned from
researching that, and this is available
[SPEAKER_02]: free.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it from the projectcb.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can download it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it turns out that there are certain
enzymes that CBD will interact with that
[SPEAKER_02]: these enzymes are responsible for
metabolizing many different drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cytochrome P450 family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have different genetic variants
of some of these enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly, these enzymes will
metabolize CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except there's genetic variants such that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A person might have a polymorphism,
for lack of a better word, a mutation on
[SPEAKER_02]: this gene that encodes an enzyme that
would normally metabolize CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if there's something odd or off or
unusual about that such that a person
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't metabolize the THC well,
that's going to stay in their system a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could be a key factor in explaining
why some people just can't handle THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke it, and you've got to peel them
off the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 20% of Caucasians have a variant
that would have that effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually two different enzymes
that play into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in other people of African descent,
a little less than 10% have this variant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Asians, less than 5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Caucasians and Middle Eastern,
about one out of five.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to this, you may have some real
problems with THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it underscores the importance of why
CBD would be particularly appropriate for
[SPEAKER_02]: such a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we finding when we talk about
artisanal CBD and people just seem to be
[SPEAKER_02]: using it at the grassroots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Either with the supervision of a doctor or
not, the different kinds of products that
[SPEAKER_02]: one can get, topicals, ingestibles,
the whole slew of different products that
[SPEAKER_02]: you get for high THC, you can also get for
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we all know about epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dramatic effects it can sometimes
have on children with these catastrophic
[SPEAKER_02]: seizure disorders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And CBD was just approved as a
pharmaceutical in the United States for
[SPEAKER_02]: those conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we're seeing on the ground,
where CBD is mainly being used,
[SPEAKER_02]: and our website has 50 different
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look at the preclinical science
and a little bit of clinical science.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the main conditions that we're seeing,
pain, anxiety, and depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what people are using CBD for.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're talking about just sheer
numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is a really great candidate for what
is a very, very complex disease,
[SPEAKER_02]: traumatic brain injury, which resists
treatment generally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But CBD, there's a lot there for people
with these conditions, both for strokes
[SPEAKER_02]: and traumatic brain injury, as the federal
government has acknowledged in the pact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certain football players in the United
States, athletes are coming out saying
[SPEAKER_02]: this really does help.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think another area that's going to
be huge in the near future is metabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: syndrome, diabetes, obesity.
[SPEAKER_02]: At Project CBD, we hear from a lot of
people that share their testimonials,
[SPEAKER_02]: as it were, with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got a number of folks saying that
when they started on a CBD regimen,
[SPEAKER_02]: and usually it's high CBD, low THC,
they did before and after experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at their blood sugar numbers,
their insulin resistance numbers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and going on a CBD treatment regimen,
four to six weeks, brings those numbers
[SPEAKER_02]: down in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've seen this now in a number of
cases with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, and this is all you might say
impressionistic and observational,
[SPEAKER_02]: except there aren't actually numbers of
blood tests that we can look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is going to be huge in the
future, given how widespread, because of
[SPEAKER_02]: Western diet, metabolic syndrome is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, people are using CBD and THC for
cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think here is also great potential,
and where we see from preclinical
[SPEAKER_02]: research, and also anecdotal observations,
is that CBD and THC combined with
[SPEAKER_02]: chemotherapy, combined with radiation,
has a greater than one plus one effect,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they really potentiate each other,
so that CBD can make the chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger, meaning you can use less of it,
which for these very highly toxic
[SPEAKER_02]: chemotherapy regimens, anytime you can use
less to have the same effect as you would
[SPEAKER_02]: otherwise, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And CBD also has its own anti-tumor
properties combined with that,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it can just help the difficulties of
going through chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another area that's very
exciting, and that's part of this
[SPEAKER_02]: grassroots laboratory experiment democracy
we see going on now with CBD and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, people are using it as a
preventive, and I think that's legitimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where this is all going,
but people say, how do they describe it?
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to describe, well,
what's taking CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it like taking CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like having a really good day,
that's what they say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is what they say about LSD
microdosing, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in any case, let's move on quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Impact of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD has accentuated a national and
international pro-cannabis cultural shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD has shifted the public discussion
about medical cannabis from whether it
[SPEAKER_02]: works to how to use it for maximum
therapeutic benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD in the United States, the backward
country that I'm from, has catalyzed the
[SPEAKER_02]: rebirth of the US domestic hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a backward country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp is not yet really legal in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Industrial hemp is growing, and it might
be soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also in hemp, the CBD colossal big
dollars, and that's quite another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're predicting $22 billion CBD
industry by the middle of the next decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these, I think, bright field group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot going on with this huge
consumer demand for CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about hemp CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in 2014, in the United States,
they passed a farm bill which defined hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: legally for the first time as a cannabis
plant where no part of the plant exceeded
[SPEAKER_02]: a grade of 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, they didn't define what
part meant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably there's no hemp plants in the
world like this because you probably have
[SPEAKER_02]: some hemp plant with a tricone that's more
than 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is part.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to get too technical
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point is that the farm bill in the
United States did not actually legalize
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp or CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: All it really did was create a temporary
exemption so that state-licensed farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: in certain states that would legalize the
growing of it could grow it on an
[SPEAKER_02]: experimental basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that experimental basis does not say
commercial use, but they use that
[SPEAKER_02]: loophole, the hemp growers to really drive
a huge fleet through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have commercial growing,
and it comes down to really rather,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a matter of interpretation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it doesn't specify that hemp could
be grown experimentally for commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: use, but it doesn't say it can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to see it one way,
you can say it's legal to grow commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: use according to farm bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to see it letter of the law
kind of thing, then it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can argue about the
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem here is that the Controlled
Substances Act in the United States from
[SPEAKER_02]: 1970 still exists, and it says that
anything extracted from the resin of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where CBD comes from,
the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can interpret all you want,
but as long as the Controlled Substances
[SPEAKER_02]: Act still exists, we've got a big problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk a little more about where I
think this is going, because another farm
[SPEAKER_02]: bill will be passed probably by the end of
the year, which will actually legalize
[SPEAKER_02]: growing of industrial hemp in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So despite DEA and FDA approval,
unregulated hemp CBD commerce proliferates
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here are some images here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see on the left, that's hemp,
industrial hemp grown for fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, hemp has, hemp is a tremendous
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We honor hemp with so many different uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you see, almost looks like binfu.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then next to that is hemp grown for
the seed oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seed oil also has many industrial
uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very nutritious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nutritional, omega-3s and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you see in the second from the
left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then far to the right, that's cannabis
plants, what we call marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what is in the middle there?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that look like, the one second
to the right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those plants, they look like industrial
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it look like marijuana?
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana is the flower tops of high-resin
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Industrial hemp is low-resin cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana, high-resin cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that look like, the Kentucky
CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that hemp or marijuana?
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it hemp weed weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not really, it's high-resin
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they're doing in Colorado,
Oregon, Kentucky, they're growing the same
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that we grow in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have to worry, at least up until
this point, about getting this absurd TAC
[SPEAKER_02]: level and making sure it meets that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they do is they grow plants that if
they were grown to full maturity would
[SPEAKER_02]: exceed that .3% TAC level, so they harvest
them early to keep the TAC level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, unfortunately, that means you're also
minimizing or lessening the CBD content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in California, we have plants that grow
20% CBD by dry weight and a little over 1%
[SPEAKER_02]: TAC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great source for CBD if you're
growing it to harvest the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will all become moot because
eventually these plants are being bred so
[SPEAKER_02]: that you'll have high-resin marijuana
plants that meet the legal definition of
[SPEAKER_02]: TAC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that definition of 0.3% TAC,
there is no scientific basis to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really kind of an absurd line.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means .4% TAC, it's illegal,
.3% TAC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, it's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's what it is in a way of extending
prohibition in another name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pharmaceutical CBD, there's been some
very important developments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you get the pharmaceuticals
Epidiolex, which is approved in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States as a pharmaceutical for treating
catastrophic seizure disorders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I welcome this development.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that whatever helps a person,
we should have access to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday, we learned that the DEA has
scheduled Epidiolex at schedule five,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the lowest possible schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Schedule six would be non-scheduled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Schedule one is where cannabis and CBD are
still at.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's considered dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dangerous with no medical value.
[SPEAKER_02]: What will happen next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will CBD remove, will DEA remove CBD from
schedule one?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to because the law says
anything from the rest is illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can just say, well, we're just
following the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably what they will say.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to what we're picking up our ear
to the ground, that you'll have this
[SPEAKER_02]: confusing legal situation that will
persist for a while in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's very interesting research being
done with single molecule CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has shown some significant potential
for psychosis, although there's been other
[SPEAKER_02]: studies that have come through less
clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Germany, there's been some very
interesting research that showed basically
[SPEAKER_02]: that CBD, pure single molecule CBD,
was as effective as the standard
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-psychotic drugs without the harmful
side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an improvement right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some recent research published
at Yale University also looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: schizophrenics with CBD, pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't turn out quite as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there's a compelling case to
be made that single molecule CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though my personal bias is toward the
plant, can be useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being shown with Epidiolex and the
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it can be useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should recognize that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Example of some other interesting research
is single molecule CBD that was just
[SPEAKER_02]: presented earlier this summer at the
International Cannabinoid Research
[SPEAKER_02]: Society.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rap versus host disease, when you get an
organ transplant or even sometimes a
[SPEAKER_02]: broken blood transfusion, it often talks
the body tries to reject the organ.
[SPEAKER_02]: In acute cases of that, it's usually
fatal, like 80%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no medical technology to help
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The study that was previewed or featured
at the ICRC press conference recently
[SPEAKER_02]: showed remarkable success with single
molecule CBD in preclinical work with
[SPEAKER_02]: graph versus host.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think any time you can develop
something, any aspect of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that fulfills a medical need,
I'm all for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm putting down my favoritism toward
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it helps a human being, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, how do we compare pharmaceutical
versus artisanal CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they both have their place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But pure CBD products lack critical
medicinal terpenes and minor cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: which interact with CBD and THC to enhance
their therapeutic benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's key.
[SPEAKER_02]: At Project CBD, we are not against THC at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We emphasize that CBD and THC should be
seen as sort of like the power couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really belong together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They accentuate each other's medical
benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're using just single molecule
pharmaceutical CBD, obviously,
[SPEAKER_02]: the THC is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not there unless you're using the
single molecule THC, which is legal in the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a schedule three drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So animal studies and anecdotal data
indicate that whole plant CBD-rich oil is
[SPEAKER_02]: effective at lower doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a wider therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has CBD isolates.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need less CBD when it's part of a
whole cannabis matrix to be effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's easier for it to be effective
than with single molecule CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least in some of the studies that we've
seen, you need a very high dose and a very
[SPEAKER_02]: precise dose for it to be effective in
these studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an important comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is with CBD isolates,
that's where we see some problems with
[SPEAKER_02]: drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a report we just put out about
CBD cannabinoid drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll kind of give you the spoiler
alert for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lengthy report on 35 pages,
single space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very serious detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very deep dive that took into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we knew this was going to come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doctors who are not involved with cannabis
therapeutics are going to be dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: patients who are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are doctors and patients who
need to know there's going to be any
[SPEAKER_02]: issues here with drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at sufficient dosages, CBD will
temporarily either deactivate or promote,
[SPEAKER_02]: induce these cytochrome P450 enzymes,
thereby altering how we metabolize a wide
[SPEAKER_02]: range of compounds, including many
pharmaceuticals and THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize most of
the drugs we consume, including more than
[SPEAKER_02]: 60% of marketed pharmaceuticals,
meaning that there's a potential
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patients on a CBD treatment regimen should
monitor changes in blood levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription medications and it need be a
just dosage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't see problems with drug
interactions of just cannabis flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: even high CBD cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't see, we don't know of any
problematic drug reactions with Marinol,
[SPEAKER_02]: pure THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't take these massive doses of
Marinol.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, 10 milligrams of THC is enough
to get you nice and high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with CBD, they're taking really high
doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of the dosage, that's where
you can get into problems with drug
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: With THC, you know, they're kind of like
this guardrails.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bump into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you've taken too much THC,
you know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not all that much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a kind of dysphoria that can set
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with CBD, there's no dysphoric
guardrails to tell you when you've had too
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because people take it in large
amounts, at least in some cases,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where the potential for drug
interactions could be problematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But drug interactions, that doesn't mean
you should forego other medications if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis and CBD can work synergistically
with conventional medications,
[SPEAKER_02]: but patients need to be aware of potential
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see it with chemotherapy and
potential positive interaction here if the
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of the chemotherapy agent are being
monitored.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because with CBD, if it inhibits the
enzyme that metabolizes the chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_02]: agent, the chemotherapy will stay in the
system longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can accumulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these things have to be looked at
seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen other situations with blood
thinners, where there are potential
[SPEAKER_02]: problems with single molecule CBD therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for people who aren't blood thinners.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also very easy to just monitor it
and change the levels of the blood
[SPEAKER_02]: thinners if you need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So see, this is, we're getting to the end
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD at the crossroads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will's DEA rescheduled CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a feeling this is not gonna happen
right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a farm bill that was supposed to
have been passed by now, a 2018 farm bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been delayed because I guess they're
too preoccupied with putting a sexual
[SPEAKER_02]: predator on the Supreme Court to deal with
the farm bill right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been pushed back a couple of
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this farm bill would legalize,
would bring the United States a family of
[SPEAKER_02]: patients and legalize the growth of
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or among other things, biomass to extract
CBD from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happens after that, that gets
confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gonna be a lot of hemp wink wink
growth in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: There already is in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kentucky, Vermont.
[SPEAKER_02]: Montana is the state that's gonna really
emerge as the big hemp state in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the problems with the focus
on the CBD for harvesting the oil and the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory privileging of single molecule
CBD is that it kind of pushes things in a
[SPEAKER_02]: direction of, it kind of limits genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I return to this whole idea of those
type two plants that we were discovering
[SPEAKER_02]: early on 10 years ago that were so
interesting and wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of just sort of fall off the,
fall to the waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people aren't really focusing on
them very much because there's such a
[SPEAKER_02]: strong push for CBD, CBD, CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that whole, what's
happening with the legalization of
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial hemp will result in a kind of
monocropping for CBD, which sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: limits, it's not a direction I think you
want to go in, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly you want to grow a lot of
plants for CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't like the idea of losing the
genetic diversity that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do have is sort of promiscuous
interbreeding, which led us to rediscover
[SPEAKER_02]: the CBD strengths in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CBD only.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it turns out that CBD becomes legal in
the United States, the rest of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't, which I think is a really stupid
way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people think, some people think
it's well, one step at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And incrementally you get to ending
cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think with CBD only you have a legal
quagmire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you grow industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow it for biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You extract the oil and you concentrate
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you concentrate an extraction,
it raises the level of what's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you start out with a plant that's
10% CBD and maybe 0.2% CBD, that's THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's legally industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You concentrate it, both the levels will
increase so that you'll have more than
[SPEAKER_02]: 0.3% THC in your concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that the product maker will
then have to remove some of the THC to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring that product to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somewhere along the process they're
breaking federal and state law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what you're gonna have as a
result of what, it's gonna be a legal
[SPEAKER_02]: quagmire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think CBD only is really workable
in terms of enforcing it either in theory
[SPEAKER_02]: or practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not workable because it's built
on a lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Controlled Substances Act is built on
a mountain of lies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana prohibition is a racist policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I compare ongoing marijuana
prohibition to the Confederate statue
[SPEAKER_02]: still standing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there, it's ugly, it should be put in
a museum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing with cannabis
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, I think I made my point,
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a point to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we, 10 years ago, the drive toward
marijuana legalization, the motivating
[SPEAKER_02]: factor was really social justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people should be unjustly discriminated
against in jail and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know the laws were targeted against
ethnic minorities since the get go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the driving force initially
for legalization, justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the driving force is business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a big change.
[SPEAKER_02]: One doesn't have to comment on the change
really, but it's just a change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should be aware of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, take home messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vilifying either holistic, herbal medicine
or modern medicine is not helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both approaches are valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are best served by having access to
a wide range of cannabinoid-based therapy
[SPEAKER_02]: options.
[SPEAKER_02]: And regulatory policy should not privilege
single molecule cannabinoids over whole
[SPEAKER_02]: plant cannabis remedies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, more information, project CBD
.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of resources there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke Signals, my book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, thanks to Cannacraft,
which is a cannabis business in California
[SPEAKER_02]: that supports some of our working
projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very last, but not least, is a picture
of Emerald Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I'm here, because it's true
what Solomon said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on that note, we'd rather,
of course, consolidate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a wonderful country for workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of public speaking at Project
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get a lot of invitations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can say there is no one more
pleasant or on the dime to deal with than
[SPEAKER_02]: Solomon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much, Martin.
We always love your talk so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful mixture of art and
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I oftentimes say government is missing
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science is missing spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spirit can always have more love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Martin always shows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
