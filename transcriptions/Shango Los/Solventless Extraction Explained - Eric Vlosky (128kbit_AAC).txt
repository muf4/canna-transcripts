[SPEAKER_03]: I record speakers like today and I take it
home and I put it on my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are not able to go to all the
conventions and you want to hear some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these hot speakers that aren't speaking
near where you live, I encourage you to
[SPEAKER_03]: check out the Shaping Fire YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our presentation right now is from Eric
Golosky from Go Pure Pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll be speaking on solventless
extraction explained, rosin, bubble hash,
[SPEAKER_03]: and dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eric is a founding member of Mass Roots
and is now director of marketing at Pure
[SPEAKER_03]: Pressure in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eric has worked with Canvas companies in
every facet of the industry and today
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll be talking about solventless
extraction techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Eric.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try and make this as
informative and interesting as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited about solventless
extraction and thank you all for being
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: By show of hands, how many people here
feel that they are at least somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with solventless extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was hoping for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beginning of this is going to be a
little bit higher surface level and then
[SPEAKER_01]: we're really going to kind of get into
some details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the topics we're going to be
covering today, it will be about 30
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes of presentation and then I'd like
to leave at least 15 for Q&A at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were getting a lot of questions at the
booth so I want to make sure that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: answer as many of your questions as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're going to go through today is
a lay of the land of extraction in general
[SPEAKER_01]: and where solventless fits into that,
some of the advantages and challenges of
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless extraction, how it might fit
into your facility or someone that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, the popular types of products and
textures, as well as, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: myths and what solventless can and can't
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this should give everyone in here a
pretty good idea of what solventless
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction is all about, where it's
heading in the next year or two,
[SPEAKER_01]: things are changing very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main products that we will be
focusing on are ice water extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, otherwise known as bubble hash,
dry sifter, Keef, and of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin, kind of, which is becoming the big
daddy of them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to preface this conversation
by basically saying that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the future of cannabis really is
processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your average grocery store,
anywhere from 10 to 20% of the perishable
[SPEAKER_01]: items are actually produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtually everything else in a grocery
store has been processed in one way or
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're really looking at is
cannabis being pretty much the most
[SPEAKER_01]: versatile drug for recreational purposes
and medical purposes that can be turned
[SPEAKER_01]: into so many different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from every edible that you can
ever imagine, people are already seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: that, vape pens, dabs and concentrates of
every texture that you've ever seen and
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps have never heard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are pretty much on the cusp of a global
market and it's easy for us to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: lose sight, you know, in our states where
we can't even move products across state
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are very siloed and segmented in
the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the concentrates are starting to
make their way up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the popular textures that people
are paying $100 a gram for in California
[SPEAKER_01]: are now starting to be produced in Oregon
and Washington where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been in California and Colorado
for a year or two already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the trends are coming out of
Colorado and California, but I think as
[SPEAKER_01]: time goes on, we're really going to see
products that are sold out for potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: a year at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boutique growers that are so popular with
their concentrates and their products,
[SPEAKER_01]: once those products can cross state lines,
that you'll be seeing people back ordered
[SPEAKER_01]: for who knows how long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of focusing a little bit
where solvent list really fits in,
[SPEAKER_01]: is in the boutique, end of the market,
really high end products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going more from that, you know,
more and more consumers are seeking
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to go into some facts and
some data a little bit later in the
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation, but anyone that follows MJ
Biz, New Frontier, Headset, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: great data sources, pretty much
concentrates are being consumed more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more at the expense of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a high amount of flour is basically
being converted into concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Colorado, Washington, Nevada,
California, those are some of the main
[SPEAKER_01]: areas that decent data is available on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Year over year, concentrate consumption
growth, not just solvent list,
[SPEAKER_01]: but all concentrates in general is
increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we expect to see that same trend over
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pretty much all maturing markets that
once cannabis becomes legal, people are
[SPEAKER_01]: very excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're purchasing joints and flour,
and you know, this is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then their taste preferences tend to
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, oh, well, how about edibles?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is a dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is that going to do for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, as people's tolerances
grow, they're looking for different
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty much across the board in
Colorado and California, concentrate
[SPEAKER_01]: growth is right around 25, 23%,
depending on where you're getting your
[SPEAKER_01]: data from that as a percentage of the
products sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Northwest, the data that we've been
told is right around 18%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely still room there
where it's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more consumption of
concentrates that's going to be happening
[SPEAKER_01]: virtually everywhere as the markets
expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to really define solvent list
extraction, what we're looking at is a
[SPEAKER_01]: process of mechanical separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mechanical separation is different
from using solvents because what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: having is various physical forces that are
separating the trichomes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids as opposed to dissolving them
in a solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're running butane,
any hydrocarbons, CO2, any of those
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent-based processes, what you're
running into is a dissolution of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're reforming that,
taking things out, you know, recovering
[SPEAKER_01]: your solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mechanical separation is anything from
shearing, breaking things open with rosin,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that really is the main distinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm not going to spend time
talking as much day is what's better
[SPEAKER_01]: because people have all kinds of different
taste preferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe at PurePressure that there are
solvent-based concentrates that are
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely elite and made very well and
when urged properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we've also seen is that a lot of
companies will take products that aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: the highest quality necessarily,
and then they will use that to put that
[SPEAKER_01]: through certain hydrocarbon and other
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the big things that we're going
to talk about today is where quality fits
[SPEAKER_01]: into the equation and how quality is such
a big part of being successful with
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important to understand that when
you're actually making a solventless
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate, you're not dissolving it with
a solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems pretty straightforward, but that's
one of the questions that we get all day,
[SPEAKER_01]: every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: To go back a little bit, you know,
hash is being made for as long as a
[SPEAKER_01]: millennia almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: The earliest reference that I could find
when researching for this presentation was
[SPEAKER_01]: 11123 that there's references of hash
being made in the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_01]: So solventless concentrates, you could
call it that, have technically been around
[SPEAKER_01]: for maybe a thousand years or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been making hash in various
ways all across the world, mainly
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated in Asia and the Middle East
where it was getting started, collecting
[SPEAKER_01]: resin from cannabis plants, forming in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure a lot of people, especially
people who have been, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming and been around for a lot longer
than I have, tie sticks, Turkish hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of different products that
before were the concentrated potency
[SPEAKER_01]: increasers that people were consuming and
now we're seeing this absolutely massive
[SPEAKER_01]: proliferation of different textures,
concentrates, extraction methods,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hash has been around for a really long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure a lot of people here may fondly
remember, you know, sprinkling keif on a
[SPEAKER_01]: bowl or a little bit of round bubble hash
and, you know, increasing the potency of
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever they were smoking and layering it
into a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've got, you know, 99.9% pure
THCA distillate that will take you to the
[SPEAKER_01]: moon and back in a tiny little dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've seen a massive, massive evolution
in the way that concentrates are being
[SPEAKER_01]: produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we expect that to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is really the tip of the
iceberg with solventless concentrates as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as solvent based.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows if there's other categories
that are going to get developed that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not even really aware of right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is really all just getting
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty much where we're at with the
main separation here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to give everyone a little
bit of a lay of the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people have familiarity
with concentrates in general, but just to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of educate everyone on where things
break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the primary methods of solvent
based distillate can be run without
[SPEAKER_01]: solvents, such as in steam distillation or
can be used with solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course the main solvent list
categories that we're going to spend most
[SPEAKER_01]: of our time talking about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that you'll notice here is
that on the bottom of this fairly busy
[SPEAKER_01]: slide is that there's a lot of textures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that we run into a
lot is that people are saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, can I make shatter with a rosin
press?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is that you can most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with hydrocarbon, you're looking at a
much bigger array of various textures that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can actually access compared to CO2,
for example, or ethanol or distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply put, hydrocarbon and rosin tend to
be the most versatile in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: textures that you can actually create with
those systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So live resin, terpene separation,
diamonds, shatter wax, butter,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of ways to skin a
cat with how many different forms and
[SPEAKER_01]: textures there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it comes down to personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could go back in time three,
four years and start talking to people
[SPEAKER_01]: about diamonds and sauce, they would have
no idea what your applesauce, like what
[SPEAKER_01]: are you even talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shatter was of course this huge
revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were taking dabs and it was pretty
much all made with butane, sometimes at
[SPEAKER_01]: home, sometimes in a very sketchy on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a very friendly environment to be
doing that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now people are figuring out all kinds
of very, very interesting ways to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: kaleidoscope of textures with different
terpene concentrations, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really becoming such a boutique
industry across the board that now,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as in the solventless category
where before we were really just looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at keif, bubble hash, older forms of
hashish, if anyone's familiar with French
[SPEAKER_01]: hashish, canola or some of the big name
older hash makers, there's all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways to make solventless,
but now rosin has really come onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: scene as a popular concentrate that's
growing very quickly in the past couple
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing I'd like to point out too
is that while CO2, ethanol and distillate,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have them listed as oils,
a lot of these products are being used as
[SPEAKER_01]: substrates for edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on what you're trying to do,
virtually any of these products can go
[SPEAKER_01]: into edibles, which then of course your
complexity of the products that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: offer is times a million because how many
things can we eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are better and less better ways to
make edibles depending on what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: shooting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that we run into
again a lot is that what can rosin really
[SPEAKER_01]: do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you actually turn rosin into?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is that almost everything
that you can with hydrocarbon,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we've actually been surprised by
some of our clients who have been actually
[SPEAKER_01]: taking us to school on what they can do
with some of our equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are doing full on terpene
separations, live rosin with fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash that they're washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are making solventless diamonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make shatter with certain strains
depending on the terpene concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean wax, all the other textures are all
being made by certain companies on rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: presses as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty cool to see that you can
spend a lot less on equipment and
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially make some of these textures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to spend time talking about
the hydrocarbon and the other systems in
[SPEAKER_01]: this presentation, but I just kind of
wanted to show everyone where the textures
[SPEAKER_01]: break down because there's a lot of
variation here and it's something we hear
[SPEAKER_01]: about a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to cover some myths that again
these are all based on questions that we
[SPEAKER_01]: get in our inbox and getting called all
day every day is that solventless is less
[SPEAKER_01]: potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have found a way to isolate THCA
with a rosin press where you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: 99% potency with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's white crystals that are coming
out and they're nucleating those crystals
[SPEAKER_01]: into the large diamonds and then sometimes
they're putting them into other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact of the matter is is that with
a solventless setup you can actually make
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely potent concentrated products.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Chalice of last year the highest rosin
test result of just a dabable oil product
[SPEAKER_01]: was in the low 90% range so extremely
potent and generally speaking this is
[SPEAKER_01]: something we're going to talk about a lot
is it really boils down to quality and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in there in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're running very high quality
material the potency of your solventless
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates can be extremely high.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60% tends to be what we've seen test
result wise to kind of be the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: threshold and that's not necessarily a bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone wants to take a dab of THCA
isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I know I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are looking for a little bit
more of a mellow experience and they can
[SPEAKER_01]: have that with a solventless product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one shatter does not equal BHL.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know one of the biggest misconceptions
that we hear is what is shatter?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what is this even?
[SPEAKER_01]: And shatter is just simply a texture of
cannabis concentrates that behaves like a
[SPEAKER_01]: thin glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can break it with your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It flakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple companies out there that
have really perfected the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: making bras and shatter and it's one of
the more popular products that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: companies especially a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it is popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what state you're in but
sometimes shatter is the buzzword.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shatter equals concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: People almost don't even think about the
other textures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just shatter shatter shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are making shatter with solventless
concentrate setups.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third big one here is that solventless
has less terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know terpene content we've seen tested
as high as 16% or more just slightly over
[SPEAKER_01]: with solventless sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a company called Dablogic here in
Denver that we work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty incredible some of the test
results that people are getting with their
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're able to get even some of the lower
range bubble hash rosins are getting five
[SPEAKER_01]: to ten percent terpene content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you open that jar it's hitting
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're smelling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're really finding is that
you're getting a full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: With most rosin you're finding that as
well as with bubble hash and just as an
[SPEAKER_01]: aside even though it's not up here just
for everyone's information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full spectrum basically means that you
have a range of cannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: and virtually all solventless concentrates
are going to offer a full spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning you haven't distilled it down to
simply just THCA even though just like we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about that can basically be done
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're offering the full range of
terpenes and cannabinoids depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: what the plant is giving you which can
lead to the entourage effect more
[SPEAKER_01]: palliative effects for certain people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically going to be the most
genuine representation of whatever plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that was grown when it's being processed
into solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tends to be the most genuine and
authentic way of making a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one hemp can't be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp is being processed into CBD hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy CBD hash rosin on the internet
today and have it mailed to your door.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want the FBI knowing that you're
buying that from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we've heard a lot too is
people haven't had great experiences with
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: For all the people that have had burnt
popcorn flower rosin I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry is still learning but now out
there you will find products if you look
[SPEAKER_01]: for them that are the highest end that you
can pretty much imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited to see where hemp can
be used with rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a process that doesn't play as nice
with solventless extraction for reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get into but it's pretty exciting
what people are doing across the board
[SPEAKER_01]: here with extremely potent concentrates,
the textures that we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpene content and being able to use
hemp in it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get to the beef here we've got our
three primary categories of solventless
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one probably most people are
familiar with at least at some level and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where you're using cold water and
ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're breaking and making the trichome
heads and stalks brittle and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking it off of the cannabis material
itself into a slurry of water which is
[SPEAKER_01]: then filtered through different micron
screens and then it's dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the basic process of making
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made by hand in drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is made in portable washing machines
that people would buy for using out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: backcountry.
[SPEAKER_01]: People make bubble hash in all kinds of
different ways and probably something that
[SPEAKER_01]: will continue to be improved upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We feel that that is actually one of the
categories that is expecting to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest evolution here in the next couple
of years because many of the professional
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash washers out there either
washing by hand or again using one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these two or three hundred dollar portable
plastic washing machines making grams of
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash full melt that sells for a
hundred dollars a gram in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something not right there but if
that's what it takes to make that product
[SPEAKER_01]: then people are doing a very good job of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drying process is something that has
been extremely tricky and has been the
[SPEAKER_01]: realm of virtually experts only until just
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drying bubble hash you have this wet
sopping mass of trichome heads and stalks
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're doing it right and then actually
dry that down so you're not getting mold
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very tricky process doing with air
drying but now people have found out that
[SPEAKER_01]: with the lycolization process using freeze
dryers you can pretty much take all the
[SPEAKER_01]: headache out of making bubble hash by
popping it in a freeze dryer and 24 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: later it comes out perfectly dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little more complicated than that
but point being it's a lot easier to do
[SPEAKER_01]: than air drying and you don't have to be
an absolute tried-and-true 10-year veteran
[SPEAKER_01]: of drying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry sift or Keef again this is probably
going to be the most familiar category.
[SPEAKER_01]: My picture is pretty blown out there so
you can't see it just pretend that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: Keef in that little box.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've got here is instead of taking
your cannabis material and putting it
[SPEAKER_01]: through water to break off those trichome
heads with cold temperatures you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: shearing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best Keef is usually made very
gently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find that a lot of the bubble hash when
people come to or excuse me a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: dry sift that people come to have us press
for demonstrations is sometimes less than
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% trichomes and the rest plant material,
detritus, all kinds of stuff and that just
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't do very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're making dry sifter Keef you
know you definitely want to be gentle on
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure everyone has smoked Keef,
enjoyed Keef, seen it, smelled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keef can be a little tricky though because
people want to beat it up a little bit too
[SPEAKER_01]: much but the goal with both of these
products is to keep the trichome heads as
[SPEAKER_01]: intact and unbroken as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start beating up Keef you're
going to find that those trichome heads
[SPEAKER_01]: are splitting open, you're getting your
oil and all these other things in your
[SPEAKER_01]: mixture which is not going to be conducive
to rosin which is where pretty much all
[SPEAKER_01]: this is heading and bubble hash and sift
are now mainly being used as precursors
[SPEAKER_01]: that are being pressed into rosin because
consumer preferences for Keef have come
[SPEAKER_01]: way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: People simply aren't buying very much of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the dry sift on the shelf isn't
very good in some places so a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: places are taking that Keef and processing
it into rosin and same goes with ice water
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: What could have passed as high quality
bubble hash a couple years ago is now
[SPEAKER_01]: something that might not ever move on a
dispensary shelf because of people's
[SPEAKER_01]: preferences and how they've learned to
love other dabs basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of places that are doing all of
these are still making full melt bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: hash which is something that is fairly
difficult to create but what that
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially means is that is the highest
quality level of your trichomes that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are receiving through your bubble hash
washing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when you're washing hash none of
your trichomes are full melt and full melt
[SPEAKER_01]: basically meaning that if you put it on a
nail, you melt it, you're trying to dab
[SPEAKER_01]: it, there's zero residue left behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what many solventless extraction labs
are doing that are focused on this are
[SPEAKER_01]: they will take their full melt bubble hash
if they're able to produce it,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will sell that in grams or half grams
for high prices and then the rest of their
[SPEAKER_01]: grades that wouldn't pass as full melt is
what they're going to go ahead and do is
[SPEAKER_01]: mix those all up together and then press
it into rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with rosin you're using heat and
pressure to break open the trichome heads
[SPEAKER_01]: and stalks which is releasing the oil and
then it's being filtered through a fine
[SPEAKER_01]: mesh bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that leaves a lot of the plant material
and the other stuff you don't want behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the oil coming out, it doesn't need
to be purged, it's ready to consume pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much immediately and this picture here
again the fidelity isn't there but that is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually an example of rosin shatter
that's glassed over that somebody pressed
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to talk a little bit about
the physics of rosin and how rosin is
[SPEAKER_01]: being made because people are going to
find that rosin is extremely disruptive to
[SPEAKER_01]: the concentrate industry in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin is something that people can safely
make at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin is something that any amateur grower
can purchase a rosin press and make dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: at home with their own material knowing
that they grew it, it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides in it, they're comfortable with
the quality that they're growing hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: and that they can process it themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we've got here is a little bit of
diagram that one of my co-workers put
[SPEAKER_01]: together for us which is either using
compressed air or a hydraulic cylinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're pressing a bag that is full of kef
bubble hash or flour, one of your
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pressure is being applied and then in
between heat and then you have your oil
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out and depending on the distance
between the center of the bag and the
[SPEAKER_01]: edges of the plates that's really going to
dictate sometimes how high quality your
[SPEAKER_01]: oil is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people will press rosin on a
giant t-shirt press.
[SPEAKER_01]: The evolution of rosin presses has come a
long way from hair straighteners to
[SPEAKER_01]: t-shirt presses to commercial rosin
presses to now we're on the verge of
[SPEAKER_01]: releasing a pretty much fully automated
version of our press that press buttons,
[SPEAKER_01]: it presses, it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in three or four short years you've
gone from guys Shanghai and their
[SPEAKER_01]: girlfriends and wives hair straighteners
to squeeze the juice out of a nub to a
[SPEAKER_01]: fully automated system so it's pretty
incredible to see how fast things are
[SPEAKER_01]: changing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is one of the really big
categories that we get a lot of questions
[SPEAKER_01]: about which is what are some of the
advantages of solvent lists and then where
[SPEAKER_01]: does solvent lists tend to struggle and I
wanted to present very honestly and openly
[SPEAKER_01]: where solvent lists has challenges is
where some of its advantages come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start with the good which is that
it's vastly cheaper to get a solvent list
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction system going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean if you're trying to do bubble hash
and rosin and you need sinks you need you
[SPEAKER_01]: literally have an empty room and you are
going to start making solvent list
[SPEAKER_01]: processing you get that going anywhere
from twenty to forty thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get started much much cheaper more
easily it's it's very simple and you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need that much to get going it's much
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yields are comparable to hydrocarbon
and other extraction methods popular
[SPEAKER_01]: contrary to popular belief this all really
boils down to quality which is something
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get into in the challenges section
but that you can get solid yields with
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent lists if you know your grower and
your genetics are high quality that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really where you're going to be the most
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest advantages is that it
doesn't require in-depth safety
[SPEAKER_01]: considerations you know C1D1 rooms people
are familiar with extraction rooms and
[SPEAKER_01]: build outs it can be extremely expensive
some people can spend as much as a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: or two hundred thousand dollars just
getting a C1D1 room architected and put in
[SPEAKER_01]: place not even including the equipment
that they're putting in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're pressing rosin you're
making bubble hash there's no solvents
[SPEAKER_01]: there's nothing flammable it's pretty
straightforward the safety protocols are
[SPEAKER_01]: much more simple fire departments are very
friendly we work with the Denver Fire
[SPEAKER_01]: Department and I actually gave a talk in
LA earlier this year to fire departments
[SPEAKER_01]: and they they almost laughed me out of the
room because of what I was talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: like oh solvent lists like why are you
even here we know that's fine so the last
[SPEAKER_01]: thing we've got on the advantages is it
retails for a really high price per gram
[SPEAKER_01]: so again every market in every area is
going to bear different prices depending
[SPEAKER_01]: on different consumer preferences but like
I was saying you know in California in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado you're seeing premium grams of
these products retail from anywhere from
[SPEAKER_01]: sixty to a hundred dollars sometimes more
on the recreational side of things think
[SPEAKER_01]: craft brewing that's kind of the best
analogy that we have is you know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to get started with it it's cheaper
most the time that people are really
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in this they have you know
boutique genetics that they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: emphasizing and trying to put out there
some of the big challenges with rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: scalability especially compared to CO2 or
ethanol I mean if you're running a CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: machine you can put tons through those
with our equipment which has some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest throughput on the market you're
looking at 10 to 15 pounds of dry sifter
[SPEAKER_01]: hash in a day which is a lot for a rosin
press but compared to ethanol or a CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: machine you know that's that's a drop in
the bucket for massive massive processing
[SPEAKER_01]: so again smaller production if you're if
you've got a bunch of low grade trim or
[SPEAKER_01]: middle stuff that you're trying to run you
know rosin pressing might not be the right
[SPEAKER_01]: method for you because you have so much
you have to go through the quality might
[SPEAKER_01]: not be there it's probably not going to
deliver the results that you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for the real real big thing here is that
it demands high quality material and
[SPEAKER_01]: certain genetics to be successful so if
your material is very high quality you can
[SPEAKER_01]: be successful if your material is not your
yields will suffer you are not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: making good bubble hash you are not going
to be making great keef and you are not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be pressing good rosin frankly so
you know people sometimes they'll come do
[SPEAKER_01]: demos with us and they bring their oldest
swaggiest material a good find and they
[SPEAKER_01]: think here you know I saw this all this
gold pouring out in your YouTube channel
[SPEAKER_01]: can you do that and you know we're not
alchemists you know rosin and solventless
[SPEAKER_01]: is not alchemy you cannot turn lead into
gold and when it comes to solventless it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really an arms race to who can be the best
grower to make the best nugs the top shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: crystal nugs to put into their solventless
system so dablogic for example one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: companies in Colorado we work with they
probably make more rosin than anyone in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado they work with a company called
Verde natural which is their grow arm in
[SPEAKER_01]: the business there are two companies and
what they do is with Verde natural every
[SPEAKER_01]: time they pull a harvest down dablogic
comes in and they take all the buds they
[SPEAKER_01]: want they get first pick they come in they
pick out all the best stuff and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: sell everything else on the shelf dablogic
washes it now to some people that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: horror story because they're selling their
flower they want to sell their best nugs
[SPEAKER_01]: but again as these markets evolve resin
farming is going to be more and more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing where people are actually growing
specifically for the purpose simply of
[SPEAKER_01]: extracting green dot labs and boulders a
great example there are innumerable
[SPEAKER_01]: examples in California and of course in
the northwest as well there's less but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a growing practice where people are
simply growing just to extract they are
[SPEAKER_01]: not even selling their buds they're
washing it they're blasting it everything
[SPEAKER_01]: and then again it works best with premium
flower whole plant fresh frozen or high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality sifted heath you cannot just run
trim through a rosin press it is not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be successful there's too much plant
material in the bag itself your yields
[SPEAKER_01]: will really suffer so there's always a
little bit of post-processing going on to
[SPEAKER_01]: make some of those premium products
whether you're washing your stuff in a
[SPEAKER_01]: hash whether you're sifting it there's a
little bit more work on the front end a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit less work on the back end
because you don't have to purge it whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant fresh frozen is really the way that
a lot of the elite labs are washing bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: hash to make the best quality products and
then one of the real big ones is it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't reduce or remove contamination so
if you've got PM in your product and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to press it into rosin well
you got PM in your rosin and that is bad
[SPEAKER_01]: and nobody wants to smoke that so please
don't do that that is my humble request to
[SPEAKER_01]: all of you if you whatever problems you're
having in your grow it's gonna come
[SPEAKER_01]: through the bag there's just no way to get
around it you would need a micron screen
[SPEAKER_01]: of a coffee filter three four or five
microns to be able to filter that out and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not even there so you know it has to
be clean and if you've got a big crop of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that's contaminated rosin and
solvent list will simply not work unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to poison people so you know
a lot of people they'll take that material
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'll blast it co2 there are better
efficient ways to process material that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been compromised solvent list just simply
is not one of those ways so just some
[SPEAKER_01]: market information just kind of go over
what we got here premium full melt bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: hash and live rosin can retail for sixty
one hundred dollars a gram in 2017 rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: was the fastest growing sub category in
Colorado and Washington the growth is
[SPEAKER_01]: really happening there and then overall
concentrate consumption growth has grown
[SPEAKER_01]: by 11% in Oregon last year MJ biz I'd
highly recommend anyone who doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase or check out their factbook they
come out with one every year them and
[SPEAKER_01]: headset they it's worth the money if you
want to learn the data this is where this
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty much all coming from and then
13% of the processors polled reported
[SPEAKER_01]: using solvent list as their primary
extraction method so to us we were
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised to see that we thought it would
be less than that but there's actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of companies out there really pushing
solvent lists and that number is
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely growing so getting towards the
end here premium fresh frozen bubble hash
[SPEAKER_01]: can be turned into some really really cool
products that people wouldn't expect on
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom left here you have a hundred
percent solvent list cartridges that are
[SPEAKER_01]: being sold by dad logic no PG no VG no
emulsifiers is coming off the press
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly as it goes into the cartridge that
is absolutely possible can't tell you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: how they'd kill me but it is happening
solvent with sauce that retails for so
[SPEAKER_01]: much it's crazy and then you've also got
THC isolate these are things we talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about as well as food grade oil from
leftovers so whatever isn't your primo
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff can also be made into high-end
edibles so pretty much you can use all
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the buffalo with solvent lists no
matter what you're doing there's a place
[SPEAKER_01]: for it and again the premium fresh frozen
derived bubble hash is really the building
[SPEAKER_01]: block for a lot of these exotic
concentrates texture and things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: being made with rosin so in some solvent
list concentrates are really quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming a huge part of the market here
especially the high-end market because of
[SPEAKER_01]: versatility someone can go buy a rosin
press make all these different textures at
[SPEAKER_01]: home and you could be a one-man band and
make some of these products you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to invest a million dollars in getting
your extraction lab started most of our
[SPEAKER_01]: customers are actually existing processing
labs that might do hydrocarbon or co2 is
[SPEAKER_01]: their primary extraction method but they
add on solvent list to create a premium
[SPEAKER_01]: product so doesn't take up a lot of space
it's easy to get started it's also very
[SPEAKER_01]: simple to learn so we really see solvent
lists is becoming you know one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger ends of the boutique concentrate
market as things evolve in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States and abroad it's a highly versatile
system you can make all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_01]: products with it it's not very expensive
and it's very safe and easy to learn so
[SPEAKER_01]: you know as it becomes more known we're
expecting more and more and more people to
[SPEAKER_01]: really latch on to this and have you know
my little grow I'm going to process some
[SPEAKER_01]: of this and then I'm going to share it so
these are some of the big companies we
[SPEAKER_01]: work with Willamette Valley Alchemy is
here in Oregon same with Queen Bee Labs
[SPEAKER_01]: they do really great work and we were
actually at a dispensary yesterday and saw
[SPEAKER_01]: some Willamette Valley Alchemy hash we
were really excited to see that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely companies out here making
really good products so I'm pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: right there thank you all for coming love
to answer as many and all questions and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever questions that we don't get
through in the next couple minutes we're
[SPEAKER_01]: at booth 406 right in front please come
talk to me come talk to us we're here all
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend and love to answer whatever
questions don't get there so if you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: question go ahead and raise your hand
we've got about 10-12 minutes for
[SPEAKER_03]: questions and I'll bring you the mic
[SPEAKER_04]: the back back in the back so if you have a
pound of really high premium flour and you
[SPEAKER_04]: take it through a good rosin press from
your company what kind of yield in grams
[SPEAKER_04]: of rosin comes out the back end any
typical situation yeah great question
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a range of yields we see anywhere
from 10 to 30 percent so with premium high
[SPEAKER_01]: resin strains you know well-grown Gorilla
glues chem strains there are certain
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that really over perform you are
gonna see in the high teens low 20s and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just with flower rosin the highest
I've ever personally witnessed was 31 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 32 percent roughly out in California some
guy had some material that didn't even
[SPEAKER_01]: look good and it just poured so to expand
on that question just a little bit too
[SPEAKER_01]: with Keith and sift you're looking at 30
to 60 percent for sift rosin and then to
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash anywhere from 40 to 80 percent
we've seen it go as high as into the high
[SPEAKER_01]: 80s some people have claimed low 90s we're
not really sure where that falls but with
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hashing goes way up from there
raise your hand if you've got a question
[SPEAKER_02]: there yeah I used the freeze dryer and you
put like you put like four or five pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: of wet sobby you know the bubble hashing
in the freeze dryer and when you break it
[SPEAKER_02]: out you get like these you get these
wafers they weigh like nothing you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean but then the liquid that comes out of
the freeze dryer smells so good you slap
[SPEAKER_02]: your own mother for what's in there you
just have this cloudy foggy material with
[SPEAKER_02]: this light oil like built up on the top of
it why is all my wonderful yummy smells
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving my bubble hash in the freeze dryer
man yeah so yeah so when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze-drying bubble hash is what's
happening is you are warming up and
[SPEAKER_01]: freezing it's the sublimation process of
your trichome head so when they're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze dryer they're gonna be warmed up
slightly it's all happening under a vacuum
[SPEAKER_01]: so that water that's coming out that's
draining out can have a lot of terpenes in
[SPEAKER_01]: it you know it's coming out of the drain
wow this smells so good yeah yep so the
[SPEAKER_01]: short answer is that it kind of comes down
to process you know we come come by the
[SPEAKER_01]: booth and let's talk about that because
temperatures dry times how long you're
[SPEAKER_01]: drying it there's ways to try and minimize
terpene passive terpene loss through your
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the water that's actually being
extracted there are definitely methods and
[SPEAKER_01]: things that we can you know hopefully
point you in the right direction on on
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know good bubble hash when it's
being freeze-dried right the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: content you know hopefully your hash on
the other end is still smelling is still
[SPEAKER_01]: smelling really good but there's
definitely some ways and things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can even do with that water potentially so
I've got a question in the same vein yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: so so some of my clients are running into
processing rosin that's really terpy okay
[SPEAKER_03]: and it has a hard time staying shelf
stable because the turf layer tends to
[SPEAKER_03]: separate do you find that that is more
process oriented or more cultivar or
[SPEAKER_01]: strain oriented good question so what we
find a lot is very high terpene content
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin tends to be less viscous so it's
very oily it can be hard to work with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of it comes down to a storage properly
so making sure it's in an airtight
[SPEAKER_01]: container as best you possibly can making
sure it's in a refrigerator or freezer you
[SPEAKER_01]: know slowing that process down because
with a lot of rosin if you leave it out it
[SPEAKER_01]: will naturally tend to auto butter you're
gonna get that separation it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: sweats so it depends on the strain it
depends on the material kind of the the
[SPEAKER_01]: short answer is storage can probably have
a huge effect on how well the separation
[SPEAKER_01]: slows way down we tend to have customers
telling us that when they're doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: right that their shelf stability is
somewhere in the realm of two to three
[SPEAKER_01]: months if they're using those techniques
if you leave it out of room temperature if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're leaving it in a non airtight
container I mean 24 hours it can auto
[SPEAKER_01]: butter sometimes so and then the strain
itself again I think that boils more down
[SPEAKER_01]: to the terpene content within it and what
kind of textures you can have available to
[SPEAKER_00]: you other questions what would you say in
general are the best strains to put
[SPEAKER_01]: through one of your pieces of equipment
yep so at the baseline more residue higher
[SPEAKER_01]: potency is gonna there's more to work with
there when you're making rosin so again
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla Glue almost a little played out at
this point people still love it huge
[SPEAKER_01]: producer a lot of the chem strains really
really do well chem dogs there's there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: million bat crosses in the chem strain one
of the one of the companies that we work
[SPEAKER_01]: with a lot Oney Seacoat Tropicana Cookies
there's some fruity strains that work
[SPEAKER_01]: really really well Crockett's Farm some
people might be familiar with them straw
[SPEAKER_01]: Nana there's some fruity strains I wish I
had a more specific answer about the exact
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profile that some companies have
latched onto that they know over perform I
[SPEAKER_01]: was given the explanation once but it kind
of fell right through my head because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was super high level but basically you're
very resinous high yielding high potency
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are always going to be typically
over performers when it comes to making
[SPEAKER_03]: solvent list right now we have time for
one more come on you know you have it
[SPEAKER_03]: guess it was that it's not yeah I guess
that you covered everything well let's
[SPEAKER_03]: give it up for Eric thank you very much
