[SPEAKER_01]: It is truly humbling to read or hear about
a human who totally defines an area of
[SPEAKER_01]: life that their biography is
indistinguishable from a discipline,
[SPEAKER_01]: that their history is also the history of
an art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Rafael Mishulam is one such person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Mishulam was a titan of cannabis
research, and his breakthroughs were
[SPEAKER_01]: breakthroughs for all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: His setbacks set all of cannabis science
back, and his successes were to the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit of all humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's episode is unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Shaping Fire, we don't do company
profiles, or product profiles,
[SPEAKER_01]: or cannabis personality profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always focus on a topic, and then I
curate a guest who is an expert in that
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire is always in service of
education instead of cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to look back on the
life's work of Dr. Rafael Mishulam,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in doing so, you will not only get an
idea of the expansive work and discoveries
[SPEAKER_01]: of Dr. Mishulam, but at the same time,
you will get a really engaging history of
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 60 years of cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you don't fancy yourself someone
who listens to biographies, you'll likely
[SPEAKER_01]: find that your interest in cannabis
medicine and the history of our favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is plenty to engage you in the
scientific work of Dr. Rafael Mishulam,
[SPEAKER_01]: who passed away last week on March 9th,
2023, at the age of 92.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's episode creates a portrait of a
man whose curiosity and unbreakable
[SPEAKER_01]: stamina for research opened the doors for
all of us interested in cannabis medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: and made whatever cannabis normalization
we are experiencing now possible.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Russo is a board-certified
neurologist and former senior medical
[SPEAKER_01]: advisor to GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: He served as study physician to GW
Pharmaceuticals for three phase three
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials of Sativex.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has held faculty appointments in
pharmaceutical sciences at the University
[SPEAKER_01]: of Montana, in medicine at the University
of Washington, and as visiting professor
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been president of the International
Cannabinoid Research Society and is former
[SPEAKER_01]: chairman of the International Association
for Cannabinoid Medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1995, he pursued a three-month
sabbatical doing ethnobotanical research
[SPEAKER_01]: with indigenous people in Peru.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is author of several books of cannabis
medicine and has published over 30
[SPEAKER_01]: articles in neurology, pain management,
cannabis, and ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Russo has joined us before on Shaping
Fire, episode 22 on treating traumatic
[SPEAKER_01]: brain injury with cannabis and mushrooms,
and episodes 11 and 27 about his famous
[SPEAKER_01]: research papers on cannabinoids and
terpenoids, and episode number 67 about
[SPEAKER_01]: treating migraines with mushrooms and
cannabis, episode 80 on cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: hyperemesis syndrome, episode 83 on
cannabigerol, CBG, and of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: the shaping fire sessions on the Shaping
Fire YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, Dr. Russo joins us to talk about
the life's work of his good friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Rafael Mishulam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunate that this has to come up due
to this event, but I hope that the message
[SPEAKER_00]: that we impart today will be valuable to
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that making sure that this story
is preserved for people coming up behind
[SPEAKER_01]: us is important, and it's important to
show the respect for Dr. Mishulam too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me today for this very
special topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you and Dr. Mishulam were very
close.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get us started, for context,
would you give us a little bit about your
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with him before we get
started looking at his career,
[SPEAKER_01]: just so people know from what perspective
you're speaking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew of him by reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time before, but we actually met
for the first time in 1999 at the
[SPEAKER_00]: International Cannabinoid Research Society
meeting in Acapulco, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time we had the
opportunity to meet one-on-one and chit
[SPEAKER_00]: chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He recognized my name as one that could be
an Israeli name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that he had been born to a
Sephardic Jewish family in Bulgaria and
[SPEAKER_00]: pointed out to him that my father's family
had come from nearby in what is now North
[SPEAKER_00]: Macedonia, a town called Monastir,
then currently called Bitola.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an immediate rapport there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I was afforded some respect beyond
that which I had earned at that time by
[SPEAKER_00]: virtue of being a physician who was
interested in cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a bit of a rarity then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me a little bit of an edge in
people taking me seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask you a lot of questions
today, asking you what Dr. Mushulam
[SPEAKER_01]: thought of this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a hard thing to speak for
somebody else, but you worked with him so
[SPEAKER_01]: much over the years and were also social,
even family friends, I think it's fair to
[SPEAKER_01]: say, that you were pretty familiar with
his thoughts on both medicine and the
[SPEAKER_01]: world at large.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that some of the questions will be
more challenging for others because it
[SPEAKER_01]: asks you to say what Dr. Mushulam thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the extra effort you need to
put into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also appreciate that you're speaking for
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I come across something that you're
like, I don't think I would know what he
[SPEAKER_01]: would have to say, feel free to just move
me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a responsibility, but why not take on
willingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start.
[SPEAKER_01]: What initially inspired Dr. Mushulam to
study cannabis and its compounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did he become interested in the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think he nicely explained this in
a resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all your listeners would find very
worthwhile to take an hour and see the
[SPEAKER_00]: film online at YouTube called The
Scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they enter The Scientist and Rafael
Mushulam, they'll find this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to answer your question, it was pretty
clear to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seemed to be the kind of person that
wanted to do something novel and
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his good education,
he was well aware of the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis had remained a mystery for at
least 150 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, morphine was isolated from
the opium poppy circa 1804.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, cocaine was identified from
coca leaves in the 19th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try as they may, scientists around the
world were unable to really get isolation
[SPEAKER_00]: of the, quote, active ingredient,
unquote, of cannabis in the 19th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some isolation of a red oil they
call cannabinol, but it wasn't quite
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wanted to try to figure out what
cannabis had in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just wasn't something that people
were paying attention to in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 1960s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't an easy thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some real challenges that they
faced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can imagine not only you're
describing how scientists around the world
[SPEAKER_01]: were having a hard time isolating things,
but of course, it was all very much
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal internationally, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And comparatively, it's relatively easy to
research cannabis during this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: creeping normalization that we're
experiencing right now, a lot different
[SPEAKER_01]: than when Dr. Mushulam began his research
in the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what were those challenges that Dr.
Mushulam faced in his research due to the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that it was not only not legal most
places, but it was also demonized
[SPEAKER_01]: worldwide at the behest of the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time, cannabis was by no means
widespread in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, early supply came from Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I understand it, people on the
Lebanese side would come to the edge of
[SPEAKER_00]: the border and throw the parcel of hashish
over the barbed wire to someone on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side, presumably with an exchange of
cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were seizures of hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where he got his supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was initially from the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to tell a very funny story about
getting help to go to the police and
[SPEAKER_00]: requesting five kilos of hash,
which he put in his briefcase and got on a
[SPEAKER_00]: public bus and became quite odiferous,
apparently, en route.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time, people just didn't
recognize the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He figured out subsequently that what he
had done was illegal on both sides and
[SPEAKER_00]: that in future he had to go through the
police to get a supply of hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, from the first five kilos
of hashish, they used the latest
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques to get a separation of
different components and found,
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated, identified the structure of THC
and also synthesized it in NOVO.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in 1964.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to that, in 1963, they had found
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabidiol was actually first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shortly thereafter, we can go through
a whole list of other discoveries that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from those initial investigations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we move forward, I have a side
question on him getting his research
[SPEAKER_01]: supply of hash from the police.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen how traditional hash is made
in Lebanon and you described them chucking
[SPEAKER_01]: it over the fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that the hash that was being
gotten from the police was dirty and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: had other items and hairs and straw from
wherever it was made or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that really matter with this kind of
molecular research because you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do an isolation and just pull out the
parts anyway or was it harder to work with
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely had to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be all these impurities and one
way or another, you'd have to get through
[SPEAKER_00]: the crudity of the initial material to get
down to the isolates of the compounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have no doubt it was more technically
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 1963, Dr. Mishulam started
researching tetrahydrocannabinol,
[SPEAKER_01]: AKTHC specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you explain how he suspected it was
present and the process by which he
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered and isolated it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically they use separation
columns, but in terms of it was well,
[SPEAKER_00]: well known that hashish and cannabis were
psychoactive and it was a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying which compound or compounds
were responsible and that includes a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of steps of fractionation and then
fractionation again to get down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: pure compound hopefully that really is
responsible for the activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, testing would have to be
done in animals and they use monkeys for
[SPEAKER_00]: better or worse for a lot of the initial
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they found so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in 1964, they isolated cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They published on that with his partner,
Yahil Gaoni.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even at the time, in reading Professor
Mishulam's old work, I'm just struck with
[SPEAKER_00]: the prescience that he had his predictions
about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quickly, they identified that
cannabigerol had to be the parent compound
[SPEAKER_00]: to THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that same year, they identified the
acid cannabinoids, which ultimately were
[SPEAKER_00]: identified later as the actual parent
compounds in the fresh plant before
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in 66, they found cannabichromine and
then there were a whole bunch of miners
[SPEAKER_00]: like cannabicyclo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't stop there and this is one
of the things I would always appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: about Rafi was he was a chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most chemists are happy to stay in their
lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was never enough for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always wanted to do more.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the biological function?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we figure out what this does?
[SPEAKER_00]: So by 1970, they had tested all of these
compounds and basically found that THC was
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly responsible and they made an
important distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even today, some 60 years later almost,
people make the mistake of saying that CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: or CBG are not psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is absolutely wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them are.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they should say is they're not
intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in 1970, Professor Mishulam knew
that and he said that these other
[SPEAKER_00]: substances were not psychotomimetic,
which was a fancy way of saying that they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't make you crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you took them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was true throughout his career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, he did not confine himself to the
lab and was heavily involved in clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: pursuits with his discoveries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that he discovered cannabidiol
before THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he started looking at cannabidiol,
was his first thought that that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: the substance that was causing
intoxication and it wasn't?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: There had been some prior work actually
done in the United States by a German
[SPEAKER_00]: refugee named Lowe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabidiol had been identified almost
perfectly in 1940, but they didn't kneel
[SPEAKER_00]: down the actual three dimensional
structure until Professor Mishulam in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1963.
[SPEAKER_00]: In science, there are often these
incremental developments and we'd have to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that that was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the timeline that you set up of the
different labs discovering the different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and figuring out their
structure and isolating them, it sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: like this time between 1960 and the early
70s, it was like bang, bang, bang,
[SPEAKER_01]: one cannabinoid after another.
[SPEAKER_01]: That must've been not only an exciting
time to be doing this initial research to
[SPEAKER_01]: finally crack the cannabis secret,
but also THC was something that people
[SPEAKER_01]: could immediately tell there was going to
be medicinal use for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the significance, both in
science, but also perhaps in society writ
[SPEAKER_01]: large, what was the significance of the
discovery of THC and impact at that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd like to take this on a couple of
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, its first notoriety came as an
intoxicant, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, being an extremely educated and
well-read person, Professor Mishulam was
[SPEAKER_00]: very familiar with medicinal uses of
cannabis throughout the ages and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that the wheels were turning with him very
quickly, but people have to understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: earth-shattering these discoveries were.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, most psychoactive drugs prior
to this time were alkaloids, so they were
[SPEAKER_00]: water-soluble substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoids were absolutely a
different kettle of fish because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: lipid-soluble and not alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had no nitrogen in them, so this
really was a bit strange and it made the
[SPEAKER_00]: material very hard to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually dissolve things in water and
instead you have these lipid-soluble,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky substances that are sticking onto
the glassware and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never been easy to work with this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, he quickly pivoted into looking at
clinical indications and probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: first one that really came to the fore was
the idea of cannabidiol as an
[SPEAKER_00]: anticonvulsant.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, he was isolating these
different components from hashish and
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing them with other scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a great collaboration between
the Israelis and the Brazilian scientists,
[SPEAKER_00]: Drs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cunha and Carlini.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1980, they published the first clinical
study of cannabidiol as an anticonvulsant
[SPEAKER_00]: in nine patients and very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would point out that these were all
people that had failed treatment with
[SPEAKER_00]: available drugs at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, people may be really struck by the
fact that was 1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get approval of cannabidiol as
an anticonvulsant as Epidiolex in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country until 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this huge gap of time that he
was very surprised and outraged by that
[SPEAKER_00]: this work had gone on, had shown such
great promise and yet got ignored for all
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be as much of a question about
the scientific method as it is about Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meshulam, but what about cannabidiol
caused Dr. Meshulam to, air quotes,
[SPEAKER_01]: suspect that cannabidiol was an
anticonvulsant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there something in the nature or
something that he had seen in people who
[SPEAKER_01]: used hashish or was it the structure of
the molecule itself that he could look at
[SPEAKER_01]: and envision how that would interact with
the human body?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm really going to attribute to his
open-mindedness.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean by that was he was very aware
of historical references to cannabis as an
[SPEAKER_00]: anticonvulsant coming from the Arab world.
[SPEAKER_00]: These dated back many centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a suspicion that hashish could
work as an anticonvulsant and then it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a matter of seeing what component or
components might be responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why he honed in on cannabidiol probably
was because they were aware at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: that it wouldn't be intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have an advantage if it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't have the liability that can be
attached to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still experience that difference even
today.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk with a lot of research scientists
on shaping fire and more or less,
[SPEAKER_01]: they fall into three different groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scientists that study an intoxicating
substance, but they never touch it
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves because they are not the kind
of person who enjoys intoxicants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the middle, you've got scientists
that don't use whatever it is regularly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they have used it to understand what
the human experience is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got researchers that research
drugs and they like using them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did Dr. Mishulam use cannabis or have any
personal appreciation for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to equivocate a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would tell a story of first human
experiences in trying THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had invited friends and colleagues to
a dinner party and his wife, Dahlia,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is a wonderful person, had made a cake
and there were portions of 10 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there were 10 people
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five didn't show any obvious effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five did, one an anxiety reaction,
the others felt something or felt
[SPEAKER_00]: different in ways that you might imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: One said nothing had happened,
but was laughing outrageously every few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one said nothing happened,
but never stopped talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can draw your own conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he didn't say in relating this story
was whether he was one of the 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I imagine he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can attest to the fact that he was not a
regular user of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another key cannabinoid that Dr. Mishulam
has credited for and we haven't brought up
[SPEAKER_01]: yet is actually one of my favorites,
anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: He discovered it in 1992.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you tell us about the discovery of
anandamide and what it meant for
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid science and patient health
generally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we just have to back up a little
bit to 2018 At that time, William Devane
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lab of Alain Howlett at St. Louis
University had discovered cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to back up a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to that time, people had no idea how
THC worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The working theory was that it somehow
disrupted the membranes of the neurons in
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that alcohol ethanol does,
but there were synthetic cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_00]: were being made and these were
stereoselective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a way of saying that if the
molecule had one configuration in
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensional space, it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if it didn't have the right one,
it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That implied that there must be a receptor
where the thing was working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The search was on for a cannabinoid
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that was found in 2018,
subsequently known to us now as CB1,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoid 1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, there was an all hands on deck
search for endogenous ligands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a way of saying that people were
looking for molecules within us,
[SPEAKER_00]: endogenous cannabinoids, now called
endocannabinoids that would bind with this
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it was super difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that set Professor Mishulam
apart was he thought the endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules, rather than being peptides,
short amino acid molecules, rather would
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be a lipid to lodge on this
receptor, so analogous to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then things get really interesting because
there they were in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the lab again with William
Devane and Lumir Hanush, his associates at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked for these endogenous
cannabinoids in pig brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, that's anachronistic for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that Jerusalem,
where the work was done, is a very kosher
[SPEAKER_00]: city.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a place in Tel Aviv that they
could get the pig brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said each time they went back,
the price went up.
[SPEAKER_00]: After painstaking work over a couple of
years, they had a tiny fraction of this
[SPEAKER_00]: material that they identified chemically
as ericadonal ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they had fun deciding what the common
name of the molecule should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it turned out, William Devane was a
Sanskrit scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew that the Sanskrit word for bliss
was ananda, so they called it anandamide,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a great name, a beautiful
coinage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kept looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found other related molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1994, they discovered another called
2-ericadonal glycerol, less flashy name,
[SPEAKER_00]: just 2-AG for short.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, didn't stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found hundreds of related molecules
that seemingly didn't do a lot on their
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in putting these together in different
combinations, by 1998, they figured out
[SPEAKER_00]: that there was synergy when you had the
main players with these less active or
[SPEAKER_00]: inactive related molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence, the concept of the entourage effect
was born in 1998.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, we have discussed maybe even a
dozen or at least 10 different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and functioning aspects of
the endocannabinoid system that Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mishulam is credited for.
[SPEAKER_01]: To round out this group, is there anything
of significance, any other cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: that he discovered that we should make
sure we mention at this time that we
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, just to make sure we do
justice to his work, his discoveries
[SPEAKER_00]: included CBD, THC, CBG, CBC, the acid
cannabinoids, CBNA, CBDA, CBGA,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabacyclo, and likely a few more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't have asked for anything better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we wrap up the first set here,
I know the entirety of the first set has
[SPEAKER_01]: been how we've been talking about how Dr.
Mishulam's research changed our
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding very specifically of
cannabis and the endocannabinoid system on
[SPEAKER_01]: a level of perspective, one level of
magnitude up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What impact did this entire body of
research have on both the scientific,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, acceptance and interest in
cannabis and in the attraction of more
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists to dive in because Dr.
Mishulam's research opened up the area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in a word, it affected it
profoundly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see if you track the number of
publications on cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, there was a huge
growth in the early 90s, which has
[SPEAKER_00]: continued for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once these molecules, particularly
endocannabinoids, were identified,
[SPEAKER_00]: it then was a matter of experimenting them
to see where they are and what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fascinating thing in retrospect is
every organ system, every type of
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological function that was examined,
there was a role for the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we had discovery of cannabinoid
compounds, then the endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to figure out how they were made
and broken down, the metabolic and
[SPEAKER_00]: catabolic enzymes, how they were
regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how there was this expansion,
sort of a pyramid of fact of research
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities and they were pursued around
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unfortunately, that has not extended
to enlightenment on the political side,
[SPEAKER_00]: nor did it totally break down the barriers
to research, which still remain in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Admittedly, it's easier to study cannabis
now than it was then, but it still remains
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is certainly the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine after Dr. Mashulam's
earliest discoveries, he never wanted for
[SPEAKER_01]: funding, though, during his career.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like he was an early celebrity
and I just assumed that he was well-funded
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to a point, but only after a certain
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: His first application of the National
Institutes of Health, which then has now
[SPEAKER_00]: been the main funder of biomedical
research, domestically and
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally, but his first application
was turned down with the explanation that
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody uses cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is circa 1963.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the tune changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partly it was because of this discovery,
but additionally, there seemed to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: political rationale of something to the
effect that a senator's son was busted
[SPEAKER_00]: for, quote, marijuana, unquote,
and wanted to know if it was going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: him permanently crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, NIH was more interested
in cannabis and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the subsequent 40 years, Professor
Mashulam had NIH funding annually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good story.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without these advertisers, Shaping Fire
would not happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis seed market is filled with
big name and hype breeders fighting to get
[SPEAKER_01]: your attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And occasionally you discover a breeder
who is breeding because it is the only
[SPEAKER_01]: thing they care to do and they would be
doing it even if they never made a dime.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my friend, Craig Hartzah,
who makes seeds as magnetic genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craig comes from five generations of
farmers and is earning his master's degree
[SPEAKER_01]: in horticulture right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been growing cannabis for 15 years
and been breeding for nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hasn't sold many seeds because he
really isn't a sales guy, but I've
[SPEAKER_01]: personally been growing his seeds for
years and I know I can always rely on his
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds to germinate, thrive and smell and
taste great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggested to Craig that he should
probably sell some seeds and asked if he
[SPEAKER_01]: had enough stockpiled to bother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much to my shock, he was sitting on five
full menus in cold storage that he
[SPEAKER_01]: produced in the last two years and hadn't
even tried to sell any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was simply too busy breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we, his friends, convinced him to
make his damn seeds available to the
[SPEAKER_01]: people and now they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the first time anywhere, you can now
buy magnetic genetic seeds at Neptune Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: Bank and on strainly.io.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neptune Seed Bank has just picked up
magnetic genetics for a trial to gauge
[SPEAKER_01]: your interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are carrying three strains from his
Mean Mug, Prominence and Turpinado menus,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are exclusive to Neptune.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an easy way to score his seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pick up those menus plus his
Hillbilly Skunk and Candy Breath Crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: and more on his profile page on strainly
.io.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want very affordable seeds that are
exceptional quality with rare turpinado
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles from a good guy, go to
Neptuneseedbank.com or strainly.io.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it is fun to buy the hype thing
from the brand you admire, but when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to buy the strain you'll love from
an obscure mad scientist, you're ready for
[SPEAKER_01]: magnetic genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magneticgenetics.org and on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has also been vigorously tried by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, but also as a bio-stimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_01]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping fire listeners can get 10% off any
size of Dynomyco on Amazon or Dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_01]: by using the discount code SHAPINGFIRE,
one word, no caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots, or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_01]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plants potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options in who to choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_01]: ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend gaslamp seeds to my friends and
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners who are looking for a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably already know gaslamp seeds as
HEMBRA genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: HEMBRA recently changed their name to
gaslamp seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaslamp seeds is not just another seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaslamp is a female-operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: With over 60 breeders and over 1,000
strains to choose from, you will certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: find something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaslamp seeds has something for everyone,
with over 650 feminized strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 regular varieties, and over 200
autoflowers to choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Names you know you can trust, like
Compound Genetics, Humboldt Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_01]: Night Owl, In-House, FastBuds,
Gnome Automatics, and Ethos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money,
[SPEAKER_01]: but have no customer service.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invited Gaslamp to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_01]: about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have A-plus customer service with
lightning-fast response times.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will get
your order out the same day you place it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most seed banks are simply not this
organized or interested in getting your
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds to you so fast, but gaslamp seeds
cares.
[SPEAKER_01]: You even get free seeds with every order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helene and Caitlin get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been in the cannabis-growing
scene for over a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want some extra freebies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the code SHAPINGFIRE, all one word,
at checkout, and they will give you an
[SPEAKER_01]: additional set of gaslamp-provided
freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an extra $30 in free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy seeds from good folks who will send
you great seeds reliably every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visit gaslampseeds.com today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Gaslamp Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the first set, we talked mostly
about the timeline of Dr. Mishulam's
[SPEAKER_01]: discoveries and clearly how it impacted
not only the research of cannabis itself
[SPEAKER_01]: as a drug, but in a larger form,
the endocannabinoid system, and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts that it had on medical research
for humans as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I want to start out here in the
second set is that how has Dr. Mishulam's
[SPEAKER_01]: research impacted the development of
cannabis-based medicines, and what
[SPEAKER_01]: potential therapeutic applications have
derived from his work so far,
[SPEAKER_01]: contemporarily?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the first obvious ones are the
classic cannabinoids, phytocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, in terms of cannabis-based
medicines, we have synthetic THC as
[SPEAKER_00]: Marinol, which has never had big impact,
but Sativex is an extract of two different
[SPEAKER_00]: chemavers of cannabis, one rich in THC and
one rich in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's approved in 30 countries around the
world for treatment of spasticity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and multiple sclerosis, but not in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the US, for the last few years,
we have had 98% pure cannabidiol as
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidiolex for treatment of severe epilepsy
syndromes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we're looking at future
developments related to cannabigerol,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabichromine, and many others,
and I need to extend the conversation to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the semi-synthetic analogs that
Professor Mishulam made, and perhaps we
[SPEAKER_00]: could run through those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please do, because I'm not sure what
those are.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, chemists like to take a
molecule and see how it might be,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote, improved, unquote, meaning
different, meaning patentable,
[SPEAKER_00]: or longer-lasting or more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good example there would be what's
called HU210.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the HU medicines were all discovered by
Professor Mishulam at Hebrew University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the HU derives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So HU210 was a dimethylheptyl derivative
of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of just a five-carbon side
chain, it was a seven-carbon side chain
[SPEAKER_00]: with two methyl groups on it, and that
made it more potent and longer-lasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So HU210 is something, I believe,
on the order of 50 to 100 times more
[SPEAKER_00]: potent than THC, and it's been a very
important agent in laboratory studies of
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system, but not a drug
for clinical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has appeared occasionally in synthetic
cannabinoids, but it's not something I
[SPEAKER_00]: would ever recommend anybody taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a colleague who did and spent the
whole weekend with a very bad experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: A closely related molecule was HU211.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this one actually got into the
clinics but wasn't approved, and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a sad story.
[SPEAKER_00]: This had the name dexanabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was investigated by a now-defunct
company called Farmos, an Israeli company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They developed this for treatment of
severe head injuries, the idea being that
[SPEAKER_00]: they would give this intravenously after
someone had a severe head injury,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully it would help prevent damage
from the head trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, after this was licensed to the
company, they never consulted Professor
[SPEAKER_00]: Mishulam again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they made a big mistake in
that because they, again, only used this
[SPEAKER_00]: once after the onset of the head injury
and not subsequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked in phase two clinical trials,
but in phase three, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder in retrospect whether they had
administered it multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result could have been different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably a done deal at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there were a variety of agency
developed that yet could make it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: clinics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Mishulam was very active in
research on CB2, the non-psychoactive
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor that's important in pain and
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thought that one of the things the
endocannabinoid system did was provide
[SPEAKER_00]: protection from non-infectious insults or
non-immunologic insults.
[SPEAKER_00]: He developed a medicine called HU308,
which is very active at the CB2 receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not active at CB1, so it wouldn't be
intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been investigated for arthritic
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then more recently in 2018, he came out
with HU580.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is, is they took the
cannabidiolic acid molecule, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: unstable, CBDA, and they made it a methyl
ester.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is they put this group on
it that made it shelf stable, and it could
[SPEAKER_00]: be a pro drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, when taken to the body,
it would break down spontaneously into
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In testing, it has shown very powerful
activity on the serotonin 1A receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: where CBD also works, but it's somewhere
between 100 and 1,000 times more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may have application in treating
nausea of different causes, among other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also might have a role in treating
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really hasn't gotten into the clinic
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There still could be developments there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a two-part question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a request for a vocabulary
clarification, but then also I would like
[SPEAKER_01]: you to explain its use in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You began the answer talking about the
cannabis analogs that Dr. Mishulam had
[SPEAKER_01]: created.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you said that, I'm like, all right,
that sounds like synthetic cannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've discussed both you and I and then on
other episodes about how synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids can be useful in the lab,
but it's not as great when they get out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab and people try to take them as if
they're from nature and they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You started by describing these analogs
that Dr. Mishulam was making, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: described these agents that Dr. Mishulam
was making, and then you seemed to
[SPEAKER_01]: contrast and say, and also synthetic
cannabinoids, where if he made them,
[SPEAKER_01]: it sounds like they're all synthetic
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first part of the answer, I'd like you
to tease those apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then second, for people who have never
thought about the use of synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids in research, in the lab only,
but not actually used out in the real
[SPEAKER_01]: world, would you explain what that lab
tool is for?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, of the ones I mentioned,
HU210 was the only one that was a CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: agonist, so would cause intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: HU210 and related drugs in the lab would
be used to look at binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you had an unknown substance who
wanted to compare its activity to
[SPEAKER_00]: something, it could be compared to HU210
as one example, whether your new substance
[SPEAKER_00]: could displace HU210 from the receptor,
compete with it, so it'd be a measure of
[SPEAKER_00]: potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have decried the use of high potency CB1
agonists as potentially quite dangerous,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these other agents, HU211,
308, 580, were all for entirely different
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes and really would have no activity
on the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like analog agent and synthetic
cannabinoids are probably in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket, but we delineate between them
because some of them are for use solely in
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab and should not be used outside for
people for either medicinal or
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the other ones are also synthetic,
but they're also promising as actual
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just refer to them differently then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: While Dr. Mishulam's role was clearly set
in pharmaceuticals, you and I have spoken
[SPEAKER_01]: on this program often about both of our
belief in whole plant medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant cannabis resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were Dr. Mishulam's personal thoughts
about whole plant medicine and using the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole resin instead of isolating compounds
and then mix and matching them to make
[SPEAKER_01]: something patentable since he worked in
the pharmaceutical realm, but also his
[SPEAKER_01]: heart was in pure medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: He straddled both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the time that we worked most
closely together was between 2003 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were both working actively with GW
Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have an annual research meeting
which he attended, I attended as a senior
[SPEAKER_00]: medical advisor at that time to the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with people at the company and
also with other cannabinoid scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly European and get together and talk
about projects and plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what we know now about
cannabidiol, cannabigerol and the others
[SPEAKER_00]: came from that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: He absolutely understood and aided the
development of these whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines, Sativex and Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, he was working on the
semi-synthetic analogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would highlight a point of difference
perhaps, he and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so sure he was absolutely
convinced of the role of the terpenoids in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may recall, I pointed out in 1998,
he had coined the term with Professor Ben
[SPEAKER_00]: Shabbat of the Entourage effect initially
applied to endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next year, the same payer published
another article and pointed out that the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing could apply to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that plants might be better
medicines than their single components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I already felt that way and I really
seized upon this and although some people
[SPEAKER_00]: have misattributed coining the term the
Entourage effect to me, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have popularized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through my efforts to show the synergy
between terpenoids and cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he needed a little more
convincing.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time in 1999, they pointed out that
this idea that plants could be better
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine than single compounds was a
theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the ensuing 24 years, we've had a
lot of proof for that theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good scientist is thinking about
possibilities and also retaining an air of
[SPEAKER_00]: skepticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you have to play devil's
advocate with your colleagues or with
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, because the whole point is
that we're hypothesizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to go into it assuming we're
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be our own devil's advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much has changed in cannabis research
in the last decade of Dr. Mishulam's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was Dr. Mishulam's opinion on the
current state of cannabis research and the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential for new discoveries in the
field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he never stopped working.
[SPEAKER_00]: He continued throughout his career to find
new things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've mentioned many of his
accomplishments, but in more recent
[SPEAKER_00]: decades, he worked with the late E.T.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob on endocannabinoids and their role in
treating osteoporosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did some clinical work on cannabidiol
for graft-versus-host disease that affects
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really never ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the more recent work on making the
methyl esters of the acid cannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_00]: make them more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the important work on the CB2
receptor done with Paul Pacher,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's at the National Institutes of
Health, and the idea that the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system provided protection
from non-infectious insults.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wording of this question is kind of,
I guess, juvenile, but I think the point
[SPEAKER_01]: of it is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabinoid research expanded here in
the last 15 years or so, did Dr. Mishulam,
[SPEAKER_01]: was he at all annoyed that there were
people who were not approaching cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine properly in some way because
there were so many people do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was he generally thinking that this was
badass, that there were all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of scientists looking into
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was not prone to criticize that often.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, he was quite willing to decry the
dearth of clinical work that had gone on
[SPEAKER_00]: in any number of areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is certainly manifest by the fact
that, again, here's a bench scientist with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lifetime record of accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the International Association for
Cannabinoid Medicines, a clinical group,
[SPEAKER_00]: was begun in 2001, he was right there at
every meeting and contributing and
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraging people to do more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another place that we got
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: All told, I tallied it up after word of
his demise.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and I were together at meetings or
working together in at least 14 different
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually must have been a pretty
heartfelt list that you worked on after
[SPEAKER_01]: its passing last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: To wrap up this set, I was curious,
you told that great story about the cake,
[SPEAKER_01]: but how did Dr. Mishulam view the use of
cannabis for recreational purposes in
[SPEAKER_01]: society?
[SPEAKER_01]: Has his research affected his stance over
the years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a little bit of a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something he talked about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My impression would be that he thought
that a lot of it was a distraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was laser focused on clinical
applications for this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't a prohibitionist overtly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any kind of sense, but I think far more
interesting to him was how can we harness
[SPEAKER_00]: these substances to treat disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see him being all, listen,
I'm trying to get the labs going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys getting busted for illegal weed
is in the news that it's not helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that he's necessarily against the use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was never so overt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure he may have harbored internal
feelings of a similar nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can follow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take another short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of good people launching
new businesses in cannabis, psilocybin and
[SPEAKER_01]: other psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very strange time for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the same moment that psilocybin
mushrooms are illegal at the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: level, they are becoming increasingly
legal in states across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: These businesses leading the way into the
future of plant medicines require
[SPEAKER_01]: specialized legal representation by
attorneys who have depth, not only in
[SPEAKER_01]: litigation, mergers and acquisitions,
but also in psychedelic and other plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Light Law Group has been empowering
cannabis businesses since 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the market has diversified into
psilocybin and other plant medicines,
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Light has been right there evolving
with their diverse clients to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: legal expertise with a high level of legal
acumen, creative strategy and precision
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes with an intimate and specific
understanding of both business law and
[SPEAKER_01]: plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a business owner trying to
navigate the labor market, with layered
[SPEAKER_01]: local and national drug laws on your own,
you are at risk of fumbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: These confusing and quickly changing laws
complicate everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Light Law Group is ready to help you
when hit with a lawsuit or because you
[SPEAKER_01]: were shafted by a vendor or business
partner, or simply because you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay legal and could use some preventative
guidance before cultivating a controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: substance as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Light Law Group is a collection of
folks who care profoundly about their
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know this is true because I know the
folks from Green Light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a huge difference between a big
legal firm who has decided to start
[SPEAKER_01]: representing a few drug companies versus
working with a collection of high
[SPEAKER_01]: integrity, passionate lawyers who are
personally interested in new plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines and firmly believe in their
power to heal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contact Green Light Law Group today and
learn more about the services they can
[SPEAKER_01]: offer your industry leading cannabis or
psychedelics company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Green Light Law Group at

seem to be all the same, but Multiverse
[SPEAKER_01]: Beans constantly works to provide you with
cannabis seeds and a buying experience
[SPEAKER_01]: that you won't find elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiverse Beans works directly with the
breeders to secure as many packs of your
[SPEAKER_01]: favorites as possible so that they have
your favorite beans long after others have
[SPEAKER_01]: sold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some shops simply buy breeder minimums,
but I get messages all the time from
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders saying some version of Multiverse
asked to buy my entire run.
[SPEAKER_01]: At MultiverseBeans.com, you can find rare
cannabis seeds from night owl seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: including the dark owl sub-label,
Mephisto Genetics, Square One Genetics,

[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_01]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copert has the beneficial insects,
mites, and nematodes, microbials,
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky cards, and air distribution units
you need to partner with nature to defend
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ethan, how has Dr. Mishulam's work
impacted the development of new drug
[SPEAKER_01]: therapies beyond cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that there are other areas
of medicine that are benefiting from his
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the endocannabinoid system is
ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the major homeostatic regulator of
human physiology and that of all higher
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's had a huge impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that hasn't extended
towards education of medical students on
[SPEAKER_00]: the system and its importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, this idea that there were these
lipid molecules rather than water-soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules, the cannabinoids, led to a real
expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the endocannabinoid system isn't
really confined to the two known
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become a much broader concept and
includes a number of the TRIP receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: and even some of the serotonin receptors,
particularly serotonin 1A, which I'm happy
[SPEAKER_00]: to say was an extension of work that I did
with colleagues at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Montana back in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's been an ever-expanding,
it's like the tendrils of the plant have
[SPEAKER_00]: extended in all these areas of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an amazing thing to see over the
30 years since the discovery of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's one of the reasons why
some people are even skeptical or
[SPEAKER_01]: suspicious of cannabis because they say,
oh, you people talk about it like it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: panacea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like as if it's going to solve all
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that only comes from people who don't
understand the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_01]: because that is the whole point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, by working with cannabinoids,
you can work on all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that the skepticism for
that is going to be overcome until more
[SPEAKER_01]: people are familiar with how the
endocannabinoid system actually functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, it's important to say
there really aren't a lot of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cures.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are a tremendous number of
things that cannabis treats effectively,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least as an adjunct, if not directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did Dr. Mishulam feel was the most
rewarding aspect of his career?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, his list of recognitions and
awards, it's a long list.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the list of what he achieved is
different than the achievements that he
[SPEAKER_01]: himself was most proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, that's a hard one for me
to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was not the kind of guy that rested on
his proverbial laurels.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was always more work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think it's something you'd
dwell on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when we look at this list of
accomplishments over the course of six
[SPEAKER_00]: decades, it's astounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the obvious pattern is the guy never
quit working or thinking about what's
[SPEAKER_00]: next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, he was a role model in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: To an extent, if I can compare myself,
it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get a paper accepted for
publication, I'm happy for a little while,
[SPEAKER_00]: but thinking about what's next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of the restless mind
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: While Dr. Mishulam was involved in
cannabis policy creation in Israel,
[SPEAKER_01]: much more than ever in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice do you think Dr. Mishulam
would give to U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: policymakers and regulators regarding the
regulation of cannabis and cannabis-based
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be really concise,
and that would be to follow the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I have no doubt that he had
pervasive skepticism about the ability of
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians to incorporate the kind of
scientific knowledge that was going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't remember him wasting a lot of
time with criticism of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be some remark in passing,
but again, his concentration was always on
[SPEAKER_00]: advancement of the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking forward, I mean, clearly Dr.
Mishulam mentored so many, and he even
[SPEAKER_01]: mentored so many people who never met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knew him through his research and his
interviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice do you think that Dr. Mishulam
would give to young researchers interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in studying cannabis and its compounds
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the first thing he'd say was
expect to work hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very deep and difficult field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the thing that attracted me when I
really got into it circa 1996 was,
[SPEAKER_00]: boy, this is complex, but it's all so
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, I became addicted to cannabinoid
knowledge very quickly and led to a career
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's happened to plenty of other
scientists and physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to really identify his personal
role in this because the thing that most
[SPEAKER_00]: people who met or corresponded with Dr.
Mishulam will tell you was how availing he
[SPEAKER_00]: was of his time in helping them with
whatever question they posed to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've met hundreds of people,
not just scientists, who said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I wrote to him and I was
shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got back to me and, you know,
or even we talked on the phone or Zoom and
[SPEAKER_00]: he gave me all this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are just blown away by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the way he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: As he explained, he didn't have a lot of
hobbies, but he was always willing to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of an amazing set of
circumstances that Dr. Mishulam even got
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a researcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: His family was persecuted by the Nazis.
[SPEAKER_01]: His father was placed in a concentration
camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: He even survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, Dr. Mishulam found his way
to Israel where, you know, we all know his
[SPEAKER_01]: research blossomed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, as a Jewish person,
this would have been part of his culture
[SPEAKER_01]: and his awareness his entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: In what ways do you think it influenced
his life choices or even research choices
[SPEAKER_01]: that he grew up in persecuted times?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, because we had so much
one-on-one time, these were things I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk to him about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, his early experiences and what
they went through in the war.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, basically, Bulgaria was occupied
by the Nazis early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a certain, well, definite level
of collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very strange situation developed in that
King Boris in Bulgaria decided that they
[SPEAKER_00]: would protect the Jews of Bulgaria to an
extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had invaded Macedonia next door
and basically allowed, even collaborated
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Nazis in sending the Jews of
Macedonia to the death camps, Treblinka,
[SPEAKER_00]: in most instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: There went all of my family on my father's
side, with the exception of my
[SPEAKER_00]: grandfather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it was a difficult
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you mentioned, his father spent time in
a concentration camp, but when it burned
[SPEAKER_00]: down and he helped the people that were
victims of that, they decided to let him
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after the war, Bulgaria became a
communist country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, again, an increase in
anti-Semitism and that's when he
[SPEAKER_00]: emigrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He emigrated to Israel in 1949.
[SPEAKER_00]: What came out of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not something he dwelled upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think that it probably caused
him to take nothing for granted in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an extremely open-minded person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also wasn't tainted by politics,
which is so easy to have happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can give a lot of examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1999, when I met Professor Meshulam,
I also met Professor Mahmoud El-Salih from
[SPEAKER_00]: the University of Mississippi,
who was an Egyptian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wondered, geez, how are these guys
going to get along?
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, they've been colleagues
forever and, you know, the politics of
[SPEAKER_00]: their nations never entered into their
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when I went to do research on
cannabis in Morocco in 2002, I was
[SPEAKER_00]: delighted with how curious people were
about Professor Meshulam there and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reverence that they had for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really transcended politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, Professor Meshulam had
Palestinian researchers in his lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there, the business with
science, it wasn't politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me of how you referred to his
thought that he wasn't as interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, he thought that science
should inform regulations and policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine him having that same idea
about politics and race and how he
[SPEAKER_01]: interacted with others, where it's like
the science was the priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's better for us to all be friends
and focus on the science than letting the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the world into our lab to slow us
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to finish this episode with,
you know, a bit of a personal question for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate the time that you've
offered us and sharing your personal
[SPEAKER_01]: stories of Dr. Meshulam.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously the two of you were
such good friends as to feel like family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious, what was Dr. Meshulam's
impact on you as both a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher, but also as a human being?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he was a role model in every
respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a very magnanimous and magnetic
guy, very warm, funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mentioned we had this
immediate bond as fellow Sephardic Jew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I considered him like my surrogate uncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was 22 years older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked a little bit like my father.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for all I know, we could have
been genetic cousins on some level,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was interchanged during the
Ottoman era between, it was a Bulgarian
[SPEAKER_00]: Macedonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all part of the Ottoman Empire at
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it was a great
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I miss him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really proud that he asked me to
write the first chapter of his last book
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thought that they needed an article on
the history of cannabis and that should
[SPEAKER_00]: begin with one of the oldest cannabis
cultures in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it happened, I had this huge amount
of data I'd amassed with nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here he asked me to write a book
chapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was very pleased with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, he provided me with what I think is
one of the best compliments I've ever had
[SPEAKER_00]: in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably about 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at a conference in London
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he tried to introduce me to somebody I
already knew, Gerich, the Swiss scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said something, the effect that of,
I'd like you to meet my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said, he has many crazy ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I left like hell because if you knew
Rafi, that was a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly took it as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a beautiful story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can imagine that, you know,
right now in this week or two after his
[SPEAKER_01]: passing, those types of thoughts are heavy
on your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you look back and appreciate your
friendship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, Ethan, for taking the time
to discuss Dr. Mishulam with us and
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing your personal stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we all know, over time,
history changes and people forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very important to record these
people who mean so much to us so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can remember them as they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you dear listener, if you would like
to hear more from Dr. Russo, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: you do, I've got a bunch of places for you
to check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the top of the list is, you can go
check out Dr. Russo's company where he
[SPEAKER_01]: does research.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's CredoScience and that's
credo-science.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also find ethanrusso.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go to the library tab,
you can see all of Ethan's papers there
[SPEAKER_01]: under that tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which is really convenient if you want
to look at his work without, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to find out, you know, where the
papers are online and trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: permissions to download them and all that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan's a big fan of having as many of his
papers available as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to reach out to Ethan
directly, he always offers his email
[SPEAKER_01]: address, which is ethanrusso.comcast.net.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I just want to say that
Ethan, you know, I think gets back to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody, or at least tries to get back
to everybody, but also realize that he is
[SPEAKER_01]: an active, everyday researcher still.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes it takes him a while to
get back with folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you might not get the reply
you want until he's stuck in an airport
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere for a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a great series on the
shaping fire YouTube channel, the Ethan
[SPEAKER_01]: Russo shaping fire sessions, which is a
series of 10 short videos on an array of
[SPEAKER_01]: topics that I thought were being under
considered in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Ethan and I sat down in his front
room and he addressed those various
[SPEAKER_01]: topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, you know, I don't think
