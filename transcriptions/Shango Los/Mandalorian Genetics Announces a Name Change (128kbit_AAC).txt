[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there friends, it's Shango from
Shaping Fire and I'm here with my good
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Dan Jimmy from Mandalorian
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of you have noticed that Dan has
been kind of teasing that he has a big
[SPEAKER_00]: announcement coming and today is the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're here on my patio for him to let
us all know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dan, what's the story?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the big news?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we'll get into it, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are gonna go through a name change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, as of today, it'll be the
name going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be switching to
NoModematics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a good direction and I
think it's gonna be really beneficial for
[SPEAKER_01]: the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mandalorian Genetics is a cool name and
we've all grown to love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, a lot of people call you Dan
Mandalorian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have been a hard choice to decide
to leave Mandalorian as a brand and switch
[SPEAKER_00]: to anything at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's honestly one of the hardest decisions
I think I've made over the last couple
[SPEAKER_01]: years with the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's also one of the smartest
moves that we could have done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to embrace the change,
grow as a company and having Mandalorian
[SPEAKER_01]: as a name moving forward as we grow could
be potentially dangerous for the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can see how there'd be a threat
because, you know, the Disney folks have
[SPEAKER_00]: got lawyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have lawyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, they probably have
lawyers for those lawyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think to sidestep and move forward is
the best thing we could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was often a good move for small
business owners like us just kind of avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole shtick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though you liked the Mandalorian
Genetics name, you're moving on to Gnome
[SPEAKER_00]: Automatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it about the name Gnome Automatics
that you identify with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly the Gnome side.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Gnome side, my cousin and I have joked
for years that I'm the Gnome as I'm the
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter one of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of you guys know that my cousin
and I, you know, run the Mandalorian page
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Mandalorian Genetics side of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's always kind of called me a Gnome
and he's also 6'4".
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of fitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of identify with that for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the Gnome side is embodying me
into the brand a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_01]: making it more original.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Automatics side is,
you know, it's a twist on the word autos
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's where our primary focus is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do work with photo period plants,
but the Automatics is something I've
[SPEAKER_01]: embraced for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the marriage of the two is
really good for the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, like, you know,
it's definitely where you built your
[SPEAKER_01]: reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where I've, you know, showed passion
for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, some people might be curious
because, you know, if you look across the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire country, there are a couple
different cannabis companies that use the
[SPEAKER_00]: word Gnome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any concerns about,
like, brand confusion or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure there may be a little bit
at first, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think with, you know, that tie in
with the Gnome Automatics and the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: we advertise, I think people get a clear
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this video helped, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it makes it more intimate to all
of our followers and all of our customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get a clear picture of what we're
doing and why we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've always been really big with
the outreach with your customers,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of folks in the cannabis
industry, you know, they make
[SPEAKER_00]: pronouncements to their fan base and they
don't really include them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you reached out to me,
you're all like, you know, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make this name change without everybody
who follows the brand knowing why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can come along for the ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that speaks a lot to how you
interact with everybody by, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of embracing folks, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where my heart is, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I like to embrace, I like to be
one on one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for lack of a better term,
intimate with, you know, my customers and
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumers of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's just one more step in
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so do we all need to change where we
follow you on social media?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like, do we have to move over to a
new Instagram page?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you going to be able to keep the
same Mandalorian pages and just change the
[SPEAKER_00]: name?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be able to keep the same
Mandalorian page, you know, and change the
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because fortunately, with the Gnome
Automatics pairing, we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: options to go down that road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that'll do is it'll allow us to
keep the confusion low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, with the full Duplex
page myself, you'll be able to see all the
[SPEAKER_01]: work and everything coming out from there,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so the Gnome Automatics page is up
today, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you want to get on the new
mailing list that is going to be dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: to Gnome Automatics drops, they should go
to gnomeautomatics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you misspell it, we got those
domains, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll redirect you to the right spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Dan, thank you so much for taking the
time to have a sit down with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really excited for this name change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not only does it make sense as
you grow as a company, but I can imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're excited about diving into all
this new gnome related artwork,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thrilled about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm really looking forward to
what we can do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of good artists out there
that have done the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waiting to finish up on our
illustrated version.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's going to be exciting for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so thanks for joining us this morning
here on the porch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why don't you go ahead and check out
gnomeautomatics.com and sign up for the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter right now so you can find out
where the new drops are taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
Thank you, Dan.
