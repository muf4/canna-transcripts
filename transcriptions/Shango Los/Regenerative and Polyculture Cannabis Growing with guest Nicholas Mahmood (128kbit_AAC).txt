[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for spending some time with
us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful to see the farm You know
the one of the reasons why I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: come over and and visit you Nick was
because you know You do something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't seen done much at all But
especially in commercial cannabis and that
[SPEAKER_01]: is you do a lot of inner planting,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You do you do inter planting where there's
the cannabis plants and then plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: are around it But then also you also do
companion planting Which I would think of
[SPEAKER_01]: as a different thing, you know plants that
are doing a job right attracting pests or
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that and You know most
commercial cannabis farms you get grids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's monoculture and and yours Looks
significantly different than that So so
[SPEAKER_01]: tell me a little bit about the experience
that you've got with with not using a
[SPEAKER_01]: monoculture and instead doing tons of
inter planting yeah, so I would say I've
[SPEAKER_00]: gone through some evolution of like
growing more for market style kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: situations and that So I have done like
more like this is for managing for easy
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and this is for that But my
evolution has always been further towards
[SPEAKER_00]: nature and that you know I spent a lot of
time out and about in the world on foot
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Living by fire and under a tarp
and and walking around the woods and the
[SPEAKER_00]: canyons and paddling lakes and oceans and
so like I had this imprinted in me all
[SPEAKER_00]: these natural spaces and Ecologies that
were really dynamic and and never
[SPEAKER_00]: fragmented in straight lines and so you
know as I realized I wanted to learn more
[SPEAKER_00]: about taking care of food and and growing
plants and feeding myself from the land in
[SPEAKER_00]: that way instead of the hunting and
fishing and walking the land I Started it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like we started to Interplant like
what we were seeing and and then
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizing the benefits of different
plants and what they do and starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn more about how plants are
interacting with their ecological role,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is that ecological role and and So
yeah, you know at the foundation that
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity All those different plants are
playing different roles at different times
[SPEAKER_00]: of the year based on the climate You're in
you're gonna develop your own spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity and complexify your matrix to
whatever degree you want because at the
[SPEAKER_00]: more complex it is the the more
intelligent it is and so You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's definitely a lot of information so
you can research what different plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing but there's needs to be more spent
time spent outside of observing and and
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with plants without
necessarily having to Understand them
[SPEAKER_00]: completely but rather open up to listening
to the plant and see what it what
[SPEAKER_00]: information it brings to you and not
that's where I feel like You know the the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship to the garden becomes this
listening this place of listening and then
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting and always trying to honor
that space to Give back to it and to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: it in this sacred Manner that it's taking
care of you and not approach it with this
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that I just want to get this one crop
out of here and it's going to this market
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know regardless I'm I just want to
figure out how to grow that one really
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you know, and it's I don't think you
know I don't think that's a very healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems very Like we're taking too much
from the space and so what also happens in
[SPEAKER_00]: that case where you Take so much biomass
from a place all at once as you take stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: From it and so if there's nothing else
there to recover or to feed the system You
[SPEAKER_00]: deplete it very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so modern agriculture is depleting
soils very rapidly, which is why there's
[SPEAKER_00]: such a kind of like everybody is going and
re mineralizing and reamending and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these things because of this fear that
it's not going to be enough and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're also cropping the place harder
than maybe it can be Create so the
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing things into a regenerative place
in requires bringing the perennials into
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden and allowing a root system of
greater depth and complexity that Remains
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ground all year to be there as the
carbon sink for the water To store and for
[SPEAKER_00]: more growth to occur in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's interesting because you've
already started Harvesting for this year
[SPEAKER_01]: and and your rows that you've already
harvested it looks like your garden is
[SPEAKER_01]: still full because of all of the
additional planting and and I like your
[SPEAKER_01]: idea that You know, even after you've
removed all the cannabis biomass your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden is still full and alive Whereas in
a in a mono crop you remove all the
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass and you've just got a you know
bare place, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your garden is going to be very much alive
all winter long even even once the once
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants have left now this particular
Farming spot you've only been here for
[SPEAKER_01]: about three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you you are you're helping,
you know build and and and You know help
[SPEAKER_01]: help Give that give the Lance more
personality and and bring it back to how
[SPEAKER_01]: it was before they put up all these this
this timber Did you choose plants for the
[SPEAKER_01]: inter planting and companion planting?
[SPEAKER_01]: intentionally because they were indigenous
to this area or because you know That they
[SPEAKER_01]: were positive companion plants for
cannabis or both both and I would say in
[SPEAKER_00]: the development of the garden I look at
what's already there and what plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: already there and I I do my best to make
sure that all those plants are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like that I have some level of care and
and That I like those plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we don't want to engage in the design
of our space and Always point out what's
[SPEAKER_00]: not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to approach a new space
regardless of if it's been abused or if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a thriving grass or if it's this and
honor it for What it is and how great that
[SPEAKER_00]: is and to try and figure out how to
partner with that space to encourage that
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological because everywhere on the earth
there's biology that exists and even in
[SPEAKER_00]: less productive places It's there to some
extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what we should be trying to do
is encouraging the evolution of that
[SPEAKER_00]: biology to become more and so establishing
gardens should be you know more about
[SPEAKER_00]: aligning ourselves with the culture of
microbiology and ecology of the place that
[SPEAKER_00]: it is and less invasive Action and less
machine use and less straight lines and
[SPEAKER_00]: more integrated poly culture that
Incorporate some of the things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally there to begin with as well as
introduce things that are really good at
[SPEAKER_00]: recovering minerals and our have really
extensive root systems that are good at
[SPEAKER_00]: catching excess nutrients that might be in
the beds where you're putting a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: your manures in your waste your your
carbon and mulches and so You know setting
[SPEAKER_00]: up your guild and in relation to a
hillside, you know The downhill side is
[SPEAKER_00]: where the nutrients Leech and so you want
a recovery crop on the downhill side so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you do water if you water You
know, usually on a hillside you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: water in this climate and and when you do
you whenever you put water out there you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make sure that if you're putting a
certain amount you want all that water to
[SPEAKER_00]: be used the most efficiently that it can
so you want the most extensive root system
[SPEAKER_00]: that can recover those nutrients into
biomass, which is the plant matter itself
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that plant matter becomes the
biomass that feeds the soil again and the
[SPEAKER_00]: more you care and maybe utilize those
crops to become biomass for the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology the more that crop will start
to grow even more vigorously and and I
[SPEAKER_00]: find this a lot especially with like
comfrey and these kinds of if you let the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop just grow or If you let the comfrey
just grow and don't cut it and use the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass You'll see that it stalls out and
flower and it doesn't get any bigger but
[SPEAKER_00]: if you use the biomass and Cut it it the
root system grows more the plant grows
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger And so our comfrey start to become
bigger and bigger and you've got a monster
[SPEAKER_00]: comfrey out there Yeah, and that's you
know, that's the the goal is to overgrow
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden space with biomass and then
you utilize the biomass that's in excess
[SPEAKER_00]: or you manage the strongly competitive
varieties of weed species and use those as
[SPEAKER_00]: bio biomass recovery So their root systems
are now valuable the bind weeds the star
[SPEAKER_00]: thistles the things That people don't want
are all contributing in a really good way
[SPEAKER_00]: To complexifying that biology so we
shouldn't just be focused on the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to grow We need to take into
account the bigger ecological picture So
[SPEAKER_01]: on the on the flip of that though There
are some crops that we do want to grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things that I thought was
pretty cool It was that you've got all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this food intermixed with the cannabis
plants So you've got you know You've got
[SPEAKER_01]: your your comfrey and your thistles and
your things that you're probably not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: Do much with but then you also got you
know potatoes and apples and and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: rutabaga you had and so so tell us a
little bit about that about what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling from the garden that's Both
providing your income through the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but also feeding you Yeah,
a lot of it can feed us and a lot of it
[SPEAKER_00]: that even can feed us We let feed the
garden too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of our crops are our crops that
we eat You know, we grow thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of potatoes, but there are also
there for other purposes so like we we use
[SPEAKER_00]: that crop in particular to keep the
rodents really well fed and We've had zero
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with Any kind of rodents even
though we have tons of rodents in there So
[SPEAKER_00]: we have you're just giving them something
better than cannabis stock You're super
[SPEAKER_00]: charging the ground with lots of
nourishment and whether that starch gets
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed by a person or by an arthropod
You know and the more it stays in that
[SPEAKER_00]: space The kind of more regenerative the
crop becomes so it's like every time
[SPEAKER_00]: something leaves a space it enters a The
realm of becoming energy intensive so you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to carry it somewhere and then you
have to drive it somewhere and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to sell it and then somebody drives
it to a fridge that's turned on to store
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, but We're trying to move in
this direction of naturalizing systems
[SPEAKER_00]: creating abundance that's always in the
ground and teaching people how to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish those things around them so that
they can go outside and Identify the food
[SPEAKER_00]: and utilize it when they need it and that
it doesn't have to be as much go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: market as it is to You know Understand
what's growing around you and participate
[SPEAKER_00]: in that process Yeah, they do this every
day
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's triggered by an arrival
sometimes it's triggered by dogs barking
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty crazy right on I got one
more question for you before before I let
[SPEAKER_01]: you get back to the harvest which is
Exactly that right, you know a lot of a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the farms that I tour not only are
they on grids But they're they're set up
[SPEAKER_01]: to be easily mechanically harvested,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got they've got easy to walk rows
and and you know, they've got areas that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can pull the sled down and and then
chop and drop and all that and and Yours
[SPEAKER_01]: is like the antithesis of that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know your rows are a little bit
like this and they get wider and thinner
[SPEAKER_01]: and and you know You've got you've got all
this companion planting right,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you might have to like dig out the
the stem to get to it, you know to cut and
[SPEAKER_01]: And I you know I can imagine a lot of
these guys that I've talked to who all
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to talk about is Scalability
down in the valley, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've got we've got 40 acres of
Hydroponic greenhouse or you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: these these these types of things where
everything's super mechanized.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Can you say a little bit about your
process and what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for is you're not mechanized
and yet I just saw your your curing room
[SPEAKER_01]: filled with plants everything looks
perfect and and and you know Uniform
[SPEAKER_01]: enough, you know, yeah how Essentially,
how are you doing that coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: What looks to an outsider as a
disorganized garden, but which is
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, you know I think we in the art
of scaling like You can only you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: scale craft beyond a certain point craft
to me Craft cannabis or artisan cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is something that stops at a pretty small
scale and so, you know the the mechanized
[SPEAKER_00]: piece only takes you further down the path
of commercial cannabis or You know
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate cannabis and As we've evolved we
played with the machines we played with
[SPEAKER_00]: the big leafers and and doing that and
what that did and we just haven't liked
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, it feels abusive to an
extent to the bud and it feels like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just losing a certain level of sacredness
and You know now we do all the big leafing
[SPEAKER_00]: on the live plants and prep really well
for big chunks of harvest to come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: that is really Helped us so we big leaf
and then we spend one day bringing lots in
[SPEAKER_00]: at once we do a good job taking care of
those plants before it's time and And so
[SPEAKER_00]: the system is really good and it only
takes like four people to kind of do the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing Efficiently we might use up to
six or seven here and there when things
[SPEAKER_00]: get tight in terms of weather or some kind
of component like that, but but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: really it's For us, it's we went that
Direction we just are going further back
[SPEAKER_00]: the other direction more by hand
outgrowing what we can even dry and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just only taking the highest quality into
the To the shop and then knowing that some
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna end up Feeding the soil for next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's not bad at all You
know, you grow a hundred percent of your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants you you take the top 50 to 75
percent and then the last 25 percent you
[SPEAKER_01]: just let drop right there and now it's got
all of the nutrients that you know next
[SPEAKER_00]: year needs yeah, and it's a really nice to
start that in the fall cut all the
[SPEAKER_00]: branches and make little piles of branches
and bury those with mulch for the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: and you create these little pockets of
Underground homes and so you get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: underground biology that lasts way longer
and more places for things to hunt and
[SPEAKER_00]: more places for things to lay eggs and
really focusing on creating that habitat
[SPEAKER_00]: for the evolution of the biology to begin
to become more complex means continually
[SPEAKER_00]: layering different sized chunks and
branches and layers of hay and manure in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring and and it just keeps getting
better and better and better so to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain degree your entire garden is like
one big hugel because everything just
[SPEAKER_01]: drops and rots on top of each other season
after season and You know, it was pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: remarkable actually when you know,
you were you actually pulled up the hay
[SPEAKER_01]: often so you're you pulled it up Potatoes
you pulled it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here's some, you know cool bugs and
then but then the one time you pulled it
[SPEAKER_01]: up and you bought brought up some of the
soil and it was I mean, it looked
[SPEAKER_01]: decadent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and and and and if I understand what
you said correctly, you really only bring
[SPEAKER_01]: in hay from elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is Is sourced from here on
on your acreage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like you're you're missing
out?
[SPEAKER_01]: With anything no, no for me everything you
need on the property I mean so the We take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of animals and so animals have some
inputs and so our inputs that come on to
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm Always go through the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take care of the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's We're not getting them out
into the forest or on pasture as much
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're managing this business and
this new place and all this and we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: use them more in the woods, but we can't
We'll bring them minerals that they need
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can't get them into the space where
they can Acquire them for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know our inputs are hay and
whatever the animals kind of need which is
[SPEAKER_00]: just some Minerals, there's a really good
Salt's that for animals that are
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so the important thing is is that the
process of of the production is
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding the the biological Breakdown
of anything that's coming into the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: so anything that comes here goes through a
lot of biology before the plants get any
[SPEAKER_00]: use out of it and so That's how we think
about everything and then we think about
[SPEAKER_00]: our garden beds as the digestion chambers
for it all so we don't do any you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Teas and we don't do fermenting and
we don't have recipes for anything We just
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that we mulch really well that
And have a lot of home and diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: space and habitat for the biology to
really express its potential in that
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere and then that brings all the
wildlife and it really does increase and
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulate the health of the whole area the
garden becomes this like birthing point
[SPEAKER_00]: for all kinds of animals and the return of
different kinds of species of snakes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've never seen here show up on year
three and you know, so it's like it keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing the Wildlife and the deer get in
there and it's all good, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's so diverse that nothing can
really do too much damage to any one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: So and it certainly helps with the with
the balance sheet since you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: running a company, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean you're saving a lot of money on
inputs that other people are putting in
[SPEAKER_01]: and your flowers actually look better So,
you know, it's it's it's you know You
[SPEAKER_01]: might as well save where you can
especially since you're in Oregon and the
[SPEAKER_01]: prices are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rock bottom Yeah, and the bonus if
you're actually if you are actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: small farm and you know, like just a
couple a couple people taking care because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's my wife and I and and You know having
animals really helps because now when you
[SPEAKER_00]: do spend money on the inputs You're also
creating food systems and you're creating
[SPEAKER_00]: other benefits And so you're getting a lot
more bang for your buck when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: running it through a herd Scenario where
then you're able to make all your own
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertility or at least enhance your
fertility to a great degree But the end
[SPEAKER_00]: goal really in a garden becomes that the
garden has enough energy Minerals and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything it needs that just with simple
human Relationship to all that biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need any more things to come to
it so you try to establish a certain level
[SPEAKER_00]: of fertility and then if you're system is
regenerative enough, it never lets any
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals or nutrients leach out of it and
so it recovers all of the important stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and makes it available later and so your
job becomes making the space for the
[SPEAKER_00]: things you want to do better and that's
the real art of regenerative agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: is growing all your own biomass to have a
certain level of carbon content in your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil so that the production and the health
is is high in a big part of that is just
[SPEAKER_00]: having that diverse habitat and allowing
the voles and the moles and the gophers
[SPEAKER_00]: and the snakes and the you know,
the things that we're Normally taught to
[SPEAKER_00]: be afraid of be the things that are
actually making the space as productive as
[SPEAKER_00]: it is That's the shift We're all you know
that we believe in the most is that though
[SPEAKER_00]: we can partner with all those components
as long as we take care of them and and
[SPEAKER_01]: the the your your living life forms are
palpable right, you know, we walk the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden and unlike a lot of monocultures
where it's just plant plant plant plant
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've got all this other stuff
you can feel it but the the bees and the
[SPEAKER_01]: wasps and the little beetles I don't know
what their names are and then the gardener
[SPEAKER_01]: snake and they you know, you can you can
you can feel that you're in a living area
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of a sterile area and you know,
it feels good on my human.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it feels good to be in the garden
and that can only benefit of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: plus you go Right into the soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not in bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so underneath all your plants are
talking to each other Yeah, and that's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to help intertwine with a diverse number
of different kinds of plants and we watch
[SPEAKER_00]: the relationships of root systems working
with each other and there's some that take
[SPEAKER_00]: over nutrient availability there's some
that work in opposition to let other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants grow and It's not really this thing
about being mad at them or saying one is
[SPEAKER_00]: good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just about understanding what's going
on and making the right choices and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting the right things in the right
spaces and understanding the relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can manage them to the least amount
of like Destructive ways possible because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the goal, you know is to be
enhancing the environment not destroying
[SPEAKER_01]: it Well put well, thank you so much for
the tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for hosting us over here on your
farm It's great to meet you so much for
[SPEAKER_00]: coming and really appreciate it right on
cool and the opportunity for this platform
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have Thank you for sharing your
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right Awesome You You
