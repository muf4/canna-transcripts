[SPEAKER_00]: The media loves to swoon about the rapid
growth of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the latest estimates are that by
2020, the cannabis industry will have
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue of $44 billion a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on par with the entire gross
domestic product of the country of Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market will swell as more and more
states legalize and new marijuana products
[SPEAKER_00]: are developed to respond to that demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of us who have been cannabis
enthusiasts for decades have had access
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time to the casual,
unlicensed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We enjoy cannabis and use it to heal
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now though, we're beginning to experience
a change like has never occurred in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've reached a tipping point where new
folks are getting turned on to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: who may never have used it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are coming by way of medical
marijuana because they are seeking natural
[SPEAKER_00]: relief without the side effects of
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are looking for an alternative to
alcohol for partying because even though
[SPEAKER_00]: we like it, alcohol is still a poison and
cannabis is much safer than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: While others simply were always cannabis
tokers who just didn't know it yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: now that they have legal access to
marijuana and have tried it, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: fallen in love with the creativity and
good feelings that come with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is these people who are the future of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will vote for it with their ballot
and they will vote for it with their cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing moves mountains in America
like cash does, right?

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Jane West.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jane is CEO of her eponymous cannabis
lifestyle brand, Jane West.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's also founder of Women Grow,
a for-profit entity that serves as a
[SPEAKER_00]: catalyst for women to influence and
succeed in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jane is a voice for mainstream consumers
and women like her who stand to benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: greatly from an alternative to alcohol and
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're gonna talk with Jane about the
wave of new cannabis consumers entering
[SPEAKER_00]: the market now and how cannabis product
developers can create innovative
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches to meeting their needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Jane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you first began cultivating this new
market of cannabis enthusiasts through
[SPEAKER_00]: your series called Edible Events and the
events were more upscale than nearly any
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabis events and they included
fine art and classical music and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: held at times that worked for folks who
had kids at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you find that the folks who came out
to these events were already integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: into the cannabis scene or were they
primarily cannabis curious folks who had
[SPEAKER_00]: found a home at an event that you put on
and spoke to them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2014, I scheduled out 12 edible
events, one for each month and we were
[SPEAKER_01]: actually able to produce seven of them
before the city just basically shut it
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each one, each event, there were more
and more people who were newbies and who
[SPEAKER_01]: were cannabis curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first couple of events were almost
pure cannabis industry people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that were in the cannabis industry
or people that were looking to get into
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the second event, I had already been
featured in a few different news stories
[SPEAKER_01]: so people wanted to come to the events not
only to be part of it but also to meet all
[SPEAKER_01]: the different sponsors and contacts that
were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was definitely a component at the
beginning but as the events continued to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen on a regular basis and especially
after our partnership formed with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Symphony Orchestra, we really
started to bring in a new group of
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers who were very curious about
incorporating cannabis into their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the beginning, was your goal
originally to bring in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry folks first or was your goal
originally to bring in the newbies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of course with this show,
our goal is to hopefully inspire people in
[SPEAKER_00]: other cities to do the similar thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who was your original target?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, my original target was me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a regular cannabis consumer and I
absolutely prefer cannabis to alcohol as
[SPEAKER_01]: like my substance of choice on a Friday
night and I simply wanted to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: really high-end event with great food and
wonderful music in an art gallery that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would wear a cocktail dress to on a Friday
night and also be able to openly consume
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to accomplish that goal,
I needed both sides of that group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed the cannabis companies who I was
also providing them a great opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: showcase their brands especially with all
the advertising limitations we have in
[SPEAKER_01]: this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to learn more about all their
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, up until the day of legalization,
adult use legalization on January 1st,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2014 in Colorado, I really, it was only a
flower consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to learn more about all
these incredible infused products on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they really became like a great place
for consumer education about new products
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was a safe welcoming location
like right in the heart of the Santa Fe
[SPEAKER_01]: Arts District that you could go attend a
cannabis event which absolutely normalized
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I was building the event series,
I went to several events that were
[SPEAKER_01]: advertised as cannabis events just to kind
of see what was happening in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them were like, they were not
well organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in locations that were not like
central to Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, the ones I did attend were not
the scene that I really wanted to be part
[SPEAKER_01]: of and didn't reflect my cannabis
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were saying that as you did more of
these events, more of these crossover new
[SPEAKER_00]: folks came and got involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think that they found out about
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people who are not into cannabis
don't necessarily read all of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So were you putting some kind of copy out
there or through the press to let them
[SPEAKER_00]: know that this event was for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I did my very best to build a
straightforward webpage of each one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I listed off all of the menus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really also tried to feature all,
utilize the network of everyone we were
[SPEAKER_01]: showcasing at the event to promote the
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, we were in one of the
best art galleries in Santa Fe at Space
[SPEAKER_01]: Gallery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would talk about the different
artists that were showcasing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at each one of the events,
there'd be some like special activities so
[SPEAKER_01]: we would talk in advance about how you can
come watch this particular like body
[SPEAKER_01]: painter or this woman that was skilled in
origami, different things depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: event.
[SPEAKER_01]: But candidly, the most important thing I
did to promote the events was to just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: my message solid with every single media
interview that I had the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: take at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invited a lot of like smaller media
companies and even guest bloggers who were
[SPEAKER_01]: really interested in the space and were so
wanted to attend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would always have a pretty large
media and PR list and take extra time to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to each one of them when they were at
the events.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could really make sure that they
understood what we were trying to create
[SPEAKER_01]: here and could share a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often when anything is taboo or that and
when often when anything that is taboo
[SPEAKER_00]: first comes to the mainstream,
you know, there's usually lots of giggling
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you find that these new crossover
cannabis enthusiasts have to spend a
[SPEAKER_00]: little time, you know, working out the
fact that they're doing something that
[SPEAKER_00]: until recently had to be underground and
instead was now only illegal federally,
[SPEAKER_00]: but essentially it was okay for them to be
at the party?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the cannabis curious, I, in my
opinion, the first step is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they have to decide that they're
interested enough to go into the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary and see what products are there
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that very first step,
they see this whole world of different
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, for instance, in Colorado,
I'm referencing Colorado, but there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: many different high quality products in
all different uptake systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's chocolates and mints and
tinctures and patches and vape pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you're looking at the products and
evaluating them, you realize that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: not what you thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, these are high quality
products being made by companies that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been in the space for a long period of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you learn that as you learn about all
the different brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once you've taken that first step
through the door, the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really, your eyes are opened up to all
the things that this can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just curiosity takes over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that seems to be kind of the
standard newbie path in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the idea of sparking their curiosity
is a great goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea of taboo, let's talk about
for yourself for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you promoted these parties
originally under the pseudonym Jane West.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ink on the new cannabis laws were
barely dry at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you create your pseudonym of Jane West
to keep your cannabis life separate from
[SPEAKER_00]: your day job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was the idea intentionally from the
beginning to start breathing life into a
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle brand called Jane West?
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the very heart of it, the idea was
to intentionally recreate my professional
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were a lot of different reasons
behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to recreate what I was doing
professionally in this world and what I
[SPEAKER_01]: was spending my time creating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there were a lot of reasons to use
a pseudonym at the time, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: because I didn't know a single person in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't sure what I was gonna do with
my more corporate job if this started to
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, there's, I mean,
it just made it a lot administratively
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to start a new business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never done anything like that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 40 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And growing up, I definitely had the
mindset that I was gonna go to college and
[SPEAKER_01]: then get a job and get a great job or do a
great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't really know any
entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one in my world is hashtagging startup
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was really setting out to do
something that I had never done before and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of had to step into this whole new
bolder persona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every step of the way, I've just
tried my best to make really intentional
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions to create what I want to see in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of that was started with
recreating myself, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, from the bit I've talked about
you and from what I've read, you
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely sound like a wonderful host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of being a good host involves
creating a space where your guests feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly the environments that you built
were pleasant to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But did you find that you played a role
kind of therapist in many cases too,
[SPEAKER_00]: like fluttering amongst the guests and
helping them give themselves permission to
[SPEAKER_00]: be at a cannabis party?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always at the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I have my master's degree in
social work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always been a fairly good
networker and especially with those
[SPEAKER_01]: initial introductions with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: At all of the events, we had a very
welcoming introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we always had a front table,
very friendly host that would kind of ask
[SPEAKER_01]: people if it was their first time and walk
them through where everything is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really it's about just being
welcoming and open and answering people's
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our third event, Me So Hungry,
we had this whole origami station.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then next to the origami station,
we had a joint rolling station.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just kind of candidly being like,
OK, how do you do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you roll a joint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull out your papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first we are going to grind up
our cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you roll up the filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by not making it too cool for school,
like you should already know how to roll a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just being open, like, OK,
let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if you can learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of broke down those barriers and
demystified people's thoughts about what
[SPEAKER_01]: the event would even be to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of times in the
beginning, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations about the event itself,
which helped spur more conversations about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a topic of conversation that you
were even there, especially by the third
[SPEAKER_01]: and fourth event, when we had people from
12 different states flying in for the
[SPEAKER_01]: events.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just became a really fun,
super social setting of like-minded people
[SPEAKER_01]: that all thought this was the place they
wanted to be on Friday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made for a great group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like your approach of not making
it too cool for school, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so much of our industry is very
elitist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's trying to get farther and
farther.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farther out over the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you brought it all the way back to,
hey, let's have fun and make this ultra
[SPEAKER_00]: simple so that we can be very inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still some risk in participating,
especially for the folks that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: appealing to that were less than
counterculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you suggest that newcomers to
cannabis weigh the aspect that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: still get fired for having cannabis in
their system or if they saw somebody from
[SPEAKER_00]: work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that some people vocalized their
concern about being outed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd love to hear, before we go to
the first commercial, what you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: told them from your therapist role on how
to get over that or make that decision for
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, no matter what,
you have to evaluate what your drug policy
[SPEAKER_01]: is at work and make those decisions for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So separate of possibly being released
from your job for consuming cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is an important topic we should talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to make a decision at every single
event regarding filming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this really was what mainly pushed
this topic among guests, because I could
[SPEAKER_01]: have not allowed filming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at every single one of the events,
the reason the name Edible Events Company
[SPEAKER_01]: and Jane West and everything we're doing
is known so far and wide is because so
[SPEAKER_01]: many meetings and media partners were
allowed to attend all of the events and
[SPEAKER_01]: were allowed to film all the events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a decision that I made early
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it definitely affected attendance of
the events because there were so many
[SPEAKER_01]: people at that time and still today who
would not be comfortable being at a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis consumption event and being
filmed or photographed consuming,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, at the same time, it's kind of a
catch-22 because until we have more
[SPEAKER_01]: mainstream consumption occurring,
there won't be the visuals out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your neighbor tries it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mom tries it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be part of our legal
lifestyles of the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unless we film it and unless we
capture these moments and take lots of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures of the party and show people what
it looks like and demystify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we allowed for filming at all of the
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, there's great imagery of
all of our incredibly classy symphony
[SPEAKER_01]: events and our brunches and all the other
things we've done that really keep putting
[SPEAKER_01]: this positive look on what we're doing
here and showing people that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: normal and you should come to the events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great place to try new products
and meet new people and start to learn how
[SPEAKER_01]: to incorporate cannabis into your life,
whether you use cannabis at that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular event or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people bought a ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for their first one, they just kind of
came to see what it would be like and then
[SPEAKER_01]: came to future events and all the symphony
events because they decided that they
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to be part of it and they wanted to
try it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I applaud your approach because a
lot of people who aren't involved with the
[SPEAKER_00]: creation of normalization think that
normalization is just about the law
[SPEAKER_00]: changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, that's just the beginning of
normalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The normalization is when people start
feeling safe to discuss their cannabis use
[SPEAKER_00]: and go out and use it socially and not be
afraid to be outed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly the approach that you
went for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go ahead and take a short
break and be right back.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shangolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our guest this week is Jane West,
founder of Women Grow and CEO at Jane
[SPEAKER_00]: West.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we were talking
about what it's like to have all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: folks who are new to cannabis find out
about the events, attend the events and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you act as kind of a therapist to help
them feel comfortable and welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that brings us up to the million
dollar question, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is for the folks who chose to use
cannabis at their first events,
[SPEAKER_00]: how did they handle that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as we know, with people who are
new to cannabis, sometimes they can over
[SPEAKER_00]: imbibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dosing is a constant challenge for
newbies.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you prepare your guests for a good
experience and not becoming over
[SPEAKER_00]: medicated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here in Colorado, there's a really
great alliance that is formed among all
[SPEAKER_01]: the infused product manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they work closely with the Colorado
Department of Health to create an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: campaign around start low, go slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was very useful because they
created, you know, third party materials
[SPEAKER_01]: that helped inform new consumers that were
part, you know, the government was part of
[SPEAKER_01]: making them with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that helped us just keep the
message universal among all the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: tenders and among tourists to Colorado,
start low, go slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's backup information behind
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically was the good to know
campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we always kind of keep to that
mantra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, at the events we're throwing
now, you go to the dispensary and you
[SPEAKER_01]: acquire a goodie bag of all of this
variety of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's information about each of
the products inside of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you choose, you know,
it was BYOC, like you choose what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming and how over the course of the
night based on all that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great because we're so familiar
with each one of the products in the bag
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can provide, you know,
inquisitive guests with supplemental
[SPEAKER_01]: information about what they're consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tend to stick with more low dose
items to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think I have to say in this
particular category, in terms of having a
[SPEAKER_01]: good experience, I think it's really
important that for your first couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis experiences, you don't involve
alcohol at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't see that happening as often as
I should.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you'll find that the majority
of negative first couple, first or second
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences that people may or may not
have, they also were consuming a notable
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I hope that newbies and would
suggest that they prepare, like we're used
[SPEAKER_01]: to always having a beverage in our hand in
this country, especially in the in like a
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, pack yourself some La Croix
or a nice like refreshing iced coffee,
[SPEAKER_01]: stay hydrated with non alcoholic beverages
and really just focus on enjoying the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really solid advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so often when people go to a cannabis
event as a newbie and they notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a bar, they go to the bar first so
they can get the drink in their hand so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they feel comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when they start consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now suddenly they're double dipping
and they're not having the proper cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, so my biggest pet peeve are the
stories that go this, this person's night
[SPEAKER_01]: started.
[SPEAKER_01]: They decided not that they didn't want to
consume an infused product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started drinking and then decided,
yeah, I might as well try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like they're already not set up
for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just should, you really focus on
experiencing the cannabis in a singular
[SPEAKER_01]: form and, and really making the most of it
and seeing how the effects of it on your
[SPEAKER_01]: body and what you really enjoy about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And focusing on that is really like,
is my best advice to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important too,
for people who are bringing in new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis enthusiasts, because a lot of
folks, if they don't have a good first
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, they're probably not going to
be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really do want them back because we
want to, we want to push normalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also, you know, most media is writing
about present cannabis users and cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, but I think that the new users who
are learning about cannabis for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time are really about to be influential.
[SPEAKER_00]: These, these crossover cannabis
enthusiasts will comprise the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: market cannabis has ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come to the market with a much
wider range of motivations than simply
[SPEAKER_00]: getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are some of the most common
motivators you hear from your guests and
[SPEAKER_00]: new customers about why they've come into
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think the core of most new
users reasoning is happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever that means, like for a lot of
women in my demographic, that's getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: good night's sleep and, and, and how much,
how important that is to their overall
[SPEAKER_01]: wellbeing and happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: For others, that are starting to use it a
bit more regularly as they're like
[SPEAKER_01]: spending all day cleaning their houses
and, and are kind of like incorporating it
[SPEAKER_01]: into their lives and seeing different ways
that it can help them in their yoga
[SPEAKER_01]: practice and, and other ways that is,
you know, bringing them more happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, women in my demographic
between the ages of 35 and 55 consume more
[SPEAKER_01]: mind-altering drugs on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than any other group of Americans through
antidepressants and anti-anxiety
[SPEAKER_01]: medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and what we're doing there,
you know, is taking a drug seeking
[SPEAKER_01]: happiness, calm in our thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think a lot of women are going to
find cannabis as a healthy substitute to
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those substances as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, I feel like the
most common motivators is seeking,
[SPEAKER_01]: seeking some more happiness in their
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly not uncommon for me to hear
from, you know, new cannabis enthusiasts
[SPEAKER_00]: that for them, cannabis, especially like
low dose edibles or a tincture is the new
[SPEAKER_00]: mommy's little helper, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've heard so many times that,
you know, it's the main reason I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: kill my kids, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or your husband, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean this, we have a right in
this country to life, liberty,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so definitely something you can find
within cannabis somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the reasons why I think that,
you know, essentially everybody's a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient because even air quotes
recreational news users are still looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for anti-anxiety, anti-stress,
increased quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that these newcomers are a
powerful force as a consumer market and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll very quickly become an emboldened
political block as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a political block who will also
likely be more effective in communicating
[SPEAKER_00]: with the legislature because they look and
they speak more like their legislators
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of much of the heritage cannabis
lobby that shared so little in common with
[SPEAKER_00]: the politicians they are lobbying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that the new cannabis
enthusiasts are quick to get involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the activism aspects or are they still too
far from that being new to the scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly hope so because we absolutely
need their help on every level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope it makes people more active
politically, especially considering the
[SPEAKER_01]: current state of the union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they definitely should be because at
the end of the day, I mean, we've seen so
[SPEAKER_01]: many community benefits to having licensed
marijuana businesses within your
[SPEAKER_01]: communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that our roads are safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that high school students here in
Colorado are using less illicit drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of tax advantages and
other ways that you can incorporate the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits of having cannabis businesses in
your community as long as you're part of
[SPEAKER_01]: actually making that legislation and part
of bringing it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in Colorado, as far as I'm
concerned, we have this like gold standard
[SPEAKER_01]: because effectively it's close to
unlimited licensing relative to other
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, we've been able to see so
many wonderful small businesses and mom
[SPEAKER_01]: and pop dispensaries in mountain towns
flourish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the type of like small business
revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I hear, especially with
incorporating hemp, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: small business, agricultural revolution
that is you can see the future if we make
[SPEAKER_01]: the right decisions from a regulatory
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we allow access to this business to
small business owners that don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: big dollars that now are necessary in new
states coming on to acquire a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: business license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope more people get involved in
finding out exactly how regulations are
[SPEAKER_01]: being incorporated in their states,
if they live in prohibition states,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that they ensure that small business
owners and local community interests are
[SPEAKER_01]: taken into account as marijuana licenses
are issued.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the break, we're going to talk more
about those entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is Jane West,
founder of Women Grow and CEO at Jane
[SPEAKER_00]: West.
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses everywhere are constantly
striving to reach out to people through
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know, though, that trying to reach
a cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service or brand
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that really lets people know what
sets your company apart from others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain your service or product
and what sets it apart as desirable and
[SPEAKER_00]: help our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately and
[SPEAKER_00]: with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the podcast is young, but growing
at an exceptionally fast rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, you are going to pay a
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction of the cost we'll be asking for
in just a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet everyone listening, both now and
to the back catalog of interviews later,
[SPEAKER_00]: will hear about your company again and
again for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_00]: listening audience we will have forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today
for rates on podcast and newsletter
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Email hotspot at shapingfire.com to find
out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Jane West, founder of Women
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow and CEO at Jane West.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in the last section,
we were talking a lot about the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: came to the events and they had a great
time and they found themselves wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to go to more events.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to get more involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they became activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure that, you know,
being more of an upscale audience,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that many of you of your
guests immediately shared your vision and
[SPEAKER_00]: started cannabis businesses of their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did your edible events spawn a series of
new cannabis entrepreneurs?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I definitely get the impression
that that is what occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one of my colleagues from the very
beginning, Heidi Keys, she started Puff
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass Paint in Colorado at the exact same
time that I started Edible Events Company
[SPEAKER_01]: and she is in like five states now and
also has Puff Pass pottery that one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: fellow moms at my kid's school teaches and
they make little pottery pieces just like
[SPEAKER_01]: all the canvas and cocktails classes,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope, I definitely think it has.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of messages speaking to that
and that's great to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope we just continue to inspire
more and more people to get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really about building a community and
it's really, there's so much room for
[SPEAKER_01]: growth here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want more and more diverse groups to
be joining the space so that that next
[SPEAKER_01]: generation can see themselves in what they
wanna build in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I certainly hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fun to see all the new ideas and
you need that new fresh energy and
[SPEAKER_01]: idealism to keep you going through the
like year three and four of being an
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to have that energy coming
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2014, you decided to go full on with
your support of new entrepreneurs and you
[SPEAKER_00]: raised $42,000 to launch Women Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that this was the next
logical step for you after cultivating all
[SPEAKER_00]: these new cannabis enthusiasts that you
might as well help them succeed by
[SPEAKER_00]: networking in a cannabis world and help
the industry evolve in a healthier way
[SPEAKER_00]: than it would have without as many women
leaders?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there were two things that were
obvious to me in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them was this incredible demand
and interest to have a job in this space
[SPEAKER_01]: and how there just wasn't access to even
find out how to start doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, when I started my business,
I could search the word cannabis within my
[SPEAKER_01]: LinkedIn profile and get through maybe
like two or three pages of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: actually had that word in their bio
anywhere and be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's endless.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have over 10,000 contacts and most of
them are in some way, shape or form in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we needed to get them more connected
back in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then secondly, it became very clear
that at the end of the day, marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization is a local issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're gonna succeed and if you're
gonna have a successful business in your
[SPEAKER_01]: community, you're gonna have to work with
your local community, your local
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators and have a network of other
businesses and colleagues that'll help you
[SPEAKER_01]: succeed in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Women were contacting me almost daily in
2014 with all the different like media
[SPEAKER_01]: news stories that were coming out about
what I was building with edible events and
[SPEAKER_01]: asking me how I can get into the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I get in the space?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna get more involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna start your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's be clear in like April of 2014,
I had just been fired from my job in
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate America, which I did not think
would happen as quickly as it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I had had a SWAT team attend
one of my events and was told that I
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't even hold those anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't necessarily think I was the
best person to be providing career advice
[SPEAKER_01]: to people, but I did observe that it was
the local network of support that the
[SPEAKER_01]: women here in Colorado referenced when it
came to why their businesses were a
[SPEAKER_01]: success and who they turned to for
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we needed to create those local
networks among all the different women
[SPEAKER_01]: that were reaching out to me to get into
the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by offering them a platform to
possibly start their own women grow market
[SPEAKER_01]: in their own city and then have that
position while they build their network
[SPEAKER_01]: and while they build their contacts,
it all seemed to make sense and be
[SPEAKER_01]: win-win.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we started doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been incredible to watch it grow
and how different each chapter is in each
[SPEAKER_01]: city and how they've flourished.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creating this new opportunity and creating
this new opportunity in so many new
[SPEAKER_00]: cities, it brings a lot of different kinds
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I interviewed A.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Braddock from Eden Labs, who I believe is
a Women Grow member just last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about the apparent
difference in approach between folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: see the healing powers of cannabis versus
the folks who are just here to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant teaches those who use it how to
be less authoritative, less greedy,
[SPEAKER_00]: more open to experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet there are others coming from other
industries who may not even toke and who
[SPEAKER_00]: see cannabis as merely a commodity to make
money with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your own vision of the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that we're more likely to
warm these newcomers to cannabis up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: spiritual side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that there may always be
this schism between folks and cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: the heart of it versus those here just to
fill the balance sheet?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like for a lot of people who are
looking for jobs within the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially a lot of the women that I work
with who are looking to apply some of
[SPEAKER_01]: their soft skills to the cannabis
business, for instance, like training or
[SPEAKER_01]: HR or bookkeeping or marketing,
photography, graphic design, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in what we're building here and
especially in how many female led
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses they can work for and work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them then as a result of
learning about a product or learning about
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing and or learning about a
business, decide that they want to try
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and that maybe start thinking
about how they can incorporate it into
[SPEAKER_01]: their lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those seem to be the individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a handful of women like Becca Foster
lost a ton of weight and turned over a new
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf and found all the wellness benefits
of the product as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really fun to see when
someone, because their career path has
[SPEAKER_01]: brought them into this space, started to
utilize the plant more and really open
[SPEAKER_01]: their eyes to all the benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other side, I'm more concerned
about individuals that don't use the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: or don't have a relationship with cannabis
at all, that are coming in on the more
[SPEAKER_01]: like big money and investor side because
they're in control of the businesses and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in control of the products and
they're making decisions about marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have any in a close
relationship with the plant, with how and
[SPEAKER_01]: why you incorporate cannabis into your
life, and also therefore hopefully an
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of like the social justice
issues and why the war on drugs is war on
[SPEAKER_01]: people and how all of that is part of the
history of this plant and part of
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes concerning that now there's so
much money in this space that the people
[SPEAKER_01]: make ultimately making the decisions and
then are in positions of power may not
[SPEAKER_01]: have that, like kind of the education that
I would hope they would have that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: only get from incorporating cannabis into
your life or really learning more about
[SPEAKER_01]: the war on drugs and what it's done and
how it's decimated families from the very
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a loaded question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's totally loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's something that we're
all going to have to deal with,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for certain, more often than not,
the visionary behind the company who
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully is creating the brand experience
and the copywriting, they probably are in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because they're passionate about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you start to bring in outside
investment and it's amazing the visionary
[SPEAKER_00]: CEO certainly has influence, but there's
no question that where the money comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from is also an influencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the best thing that we
can do is normalize and invite these
[SPEAKER_00]: people into cannabis as consumers as
quickly as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually loved the one that you said,
people who have, you said something like
[SPEAKER_00]: involved cannabis in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pictured in the evangelists on the
street, going up to people, have you
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted cannabis into your life?
[SPEAKER_00]: So your own line of new products known as
the Jane West collection are a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: balance of both beauty and functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're discreet and yet instantly
recognizable from like a branding point of
[SPEAKER_00]: view.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice borosilicate pieces made in
partnership with Grav Labs, who I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: a fan of for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Grav is known for their simple
elegance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dare say that the Jane West line looks
to be like the Kate Spade of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're high-end design, super desirable
and really functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in your advertising copy, you make it
clear that your market are these new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumers and especially women.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Jane West, the company brings new
products to the market, what do you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to offer these new users that they're not
already finding elsewhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just like the events that I created,
I wanted these products to exist and I
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't find anything in the market that
matched my aesthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm hoping to just fill that gap
that I see existing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've definitely wanted something with a
lot of functionality, but that also had
[SPEAKER_01]: that sleek design that you would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more we normalize cannabis use,
the more these products will be out in
[SPEAKER_01]: your home and that you will use them for
entertaining with guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the way I picture a legal future,
people have little pipes around their home
[SPEAKER_01]: in the same numbers and proportions that
they have little shot glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to have a collection and
in order to like, just like you have eight
[SPEAKER_01]: wine glasses at your house, you wanted
these replicable products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want something that matches the
aesthetic of your home, something you
[SPEAKER_01]: would put out for guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I wanted to bring into
the world and to create.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have flower hour here at my house,
just like happy hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are the products that are
part of that like dream future of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market segment that you and I have
been chatting about today is rapidly
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding and the copywriting and products
to reach them has not really been invented
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you offer other
entrepreneurs who want to reach this
[SPEAKER_00]: market as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, do not assume what
your customers want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for me, in what I'm building,
it's a little bit easier because I'm only
[SPEAKER_01]: creating what I want to use and products
that I would use on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of my check mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you're creating products for a
larger demo and users beyond yourself as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you should talk to your customers a
lot more than you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identify some individuals that you think
will be exactly your core customers and
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you're involving them in
conversations early on about the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like I have wide ranging focus groups
for all of my products as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll learn little things that you
haven't even thought of yet that are
[SPEAKER_01]: crucial in terms of talking to new
consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, I was in a branding meeting
last year where we kept referring to
[SPEAKER_01]: different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, well, what strain should we
use this for and what strain should we use
[SPEAKER_01]: that for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the newbies there was like,
why are you saying strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like an illness, like a disease,
like a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, why don't you call it a
varietal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's more like wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you really mean,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are different varieties of cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the type of important learning
that helps us as we start to literally
[SPEAKER_01]: create this lexicon in a whole new market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so talk to your consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, I would make sure you're telling
the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a problem overall with marketing
and branding in this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a shampoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 40 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a shampoo in my shower right now
that says that it's going to prevent my
[SPEAKER_01]: hair from breaking or turning gray and
extra moisturizes all the cells of my
[SPEAKER_01]: skull.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if all of that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like a stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're really educating consumers
about this brand new product, let's not
[SPEAKER_01]: exaggerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be as straightforward as we can
about the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's make sure we're educating the
consumer about how to incorporate these
[SPEAKER_01]: products into their lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that's anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people will be talking
firsthand with your customers and with
[SPEAKER_01]: happy customers is a great way to find out
more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: About how they utilize your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, if you keep creating what
you love, then you're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be on the right path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vision is really everything in this space
right now because we're creating this new
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to actually have your company
scale and succeed, you're going to need to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to have a shared vision of what
this future looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so make sure you're defining that for
yourself as you set out and figuring out
[SPEAKER_01]: the best way to communicate that to the
rest of your team so that you all know
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're working on and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the teams that I see succeeding most
in this space right now have that shared
[SPEAKER_01]: vision of what they're bringing to the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it in the products they're
creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a lot of fun chatting with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's great to go through an
interview with a smile on my face the
