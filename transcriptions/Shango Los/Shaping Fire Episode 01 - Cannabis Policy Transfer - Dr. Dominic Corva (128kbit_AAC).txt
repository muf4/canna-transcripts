[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is retaking America.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be the most relied on tincture
in every home until it was demonized in
[SPEAKER_01]: the early 1900s, but now it's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even more states will legalize cannabis
this November.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's enough momentum now between
business activists and patient activists
[SPEAKER_01]: that the door on cannabis will simply not
close again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients everywhere are getting relief
from using different forms of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, and entrepreneurs smell
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many, including myself, are excited to
build an industry from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to the first episode of
the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire will focus on innovations in
the cannabis sphere, including both
[SPEAKER_01]: business disruptions as well as new
research into cannabis and health.
[SPEAKER_01]: I offer you access to cannabis industry
luminaries, talking frankly about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in ways you will not find elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have followed me from gangepreneur
.com, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have not heard the 54 episodes of
the podcast I founded for gangepreneur
[SPEAKER_01]: .com, you should definitely check those
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an exceptional amount of smart
analysis in those interviews from the top
[SPEAKER_01]: minds in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I wanted to go out on my
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please subscribe to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell your friends about the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set a trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, my guest is Dr. Dominic Korva.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dominic Korva is the founder and social
science research director of the Center
[SPEAKER_01]: for the Study of Cannabis and Social
Policy, known as
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome to the show, Dominic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you could join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dominic, when Colorado and Washington
first began to write rules for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: sales, you know, they had never done this
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the approaches worked well,
while many of them very much did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're at the point that Alaska and
Oregon are in rulemaking and there looks
[SPEAKER_01]: to be maybe six more states in play to
begin licensing cannabis sales after the
[SPEAKER_01]: November vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the new states appear to be learning
from the best and worst practices of
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington and Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit, but not in a particularly
formal or organized way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the news cycle is probably
driving a lot of attention to things such
[SPEAKER_00]: as pesticide regulation, which is a big
oversight, I think, early on in our
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other states get to start where we
are right now instead of taking four years
[SPEAKER_00]: to come around to, you know, the fact that
this is of some concern for public health
[SPEAKER_00]: and safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that's a really good
point that you make that the media role
[SPEAKER_01]: that they play in policy transfer between
the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: To what degree do the other states
regulators find out what's going on in a
[SPEAKER_01]: target state by just reading the news
versus talking to the regulators in states
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, directly by getting on the
phone and calling them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I actually don't think it's all
that organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been paying pretty close attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, I kind of brought up this
possibility of bad policy transfer between
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington and Oregon, maybe a year ago
when Oregon seemed to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: moving towards a more of a strict
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in the subsequent year,
Oregon's also kind of backed off and fix
[SPEAKER_00]: some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it really depends on how
organized and where the industry is in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of their conversations with their
lobbyists and their legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it depends on the conversations
between industries in different states.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of people who are
developing brands in different states.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have experience with, you know,
policy in one state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually probably think that it's
through, you know, lobbyists that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: policy transfer possibilities open up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're suggesting is that the
lobbyists are actually doing the homework
[SPEAKER_01]: for the regulators and going to other
states and figuring out what the best way
[SPEAKER_01]: to go is and then bringing that to the
legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I believe that's the case for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there's some cross-border
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not that familiar with,
you know, the personal lives of
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians in different states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, these people,
when they're outside the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably discussing national
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of those besides
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's also, in the case of
Washington, you know, most of our
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature just was so sick of it anyway,
they don't really care to chat too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's not a lot of sort of
formally organized caucuses, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are regional caucuses where,
you know, members of different political
[SPEAKER_00]: parties, but around the same issue get
together and try to coordinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that will come and certainly the
case of California, since it's like about
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 other states, you know, all in one,
you know, you're going to see a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: of that sort of intrastate level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That still has to happen, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to happen not just between states,
but between jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many jurisdictions, you know,
are still, they haven't even learned the
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons from other jurisdictions in their
own state yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm seeing that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's really frustrating,
too, to realize how, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they say you don't want to, you don't want
to see the sausage being made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really astonishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at each state, you've got them
making regulatory attempts at the state
[SPEAKER_01]: level, which then get kind of remixed at
the county level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got people, you know,
passing moratoriums or changing zoning
[SPEAKER_01]: laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's happening at each state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so the states are talking to
each other either via lobbyists or the
[SPEAKER_01]: media or, you know, political visits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that gets transferred and some
of it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the different groups,
you know, concerned parents or investors,
[SPEAKER_01]: these different groups have different
amounts of power at these different
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a pretty chaotic mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of frustrating to see
something that we all care about as much
[SPEAKER_01]: as cannabis to be handled this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also, it's also a primer in how a
government actually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially, you know, government by
initiative, I would say, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the citizens initiatives have been how
cannabis policy has been changed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means we've been sort of leading
them by the nose, you know, to come along
[SPEAKER_00]: and do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I would say that it probably will get
a little more organized around revenue
[SPEAKER_00]: policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's something that
politicians are particularly interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how they view, you know,
cannabis as a, you know, a new cow to
[SPEAKER_00]: milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's far more likely that
we will see a little more, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: harmonization, let's say, of tax rates as
that information will be sought out by
[SPEAKER_00]: local and state policymakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of us who don't have a lot of
experience talking about policy or
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about policy, I'd love to flesh
out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, you know, well, this is what you
get when you legislate by initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm assuming, you know, you're
comparing legislating by initiative
[SPEAKER_01]: versus, you know, law passing by the state
Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of describe the difference
and why you kind of gave that nod to the
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges of initiatives?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiatives push the legislatures to do
something that they clearly weren't going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their whole point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legislators, because if they were going to
do it, they would simply, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: rewrite laws or write new laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a, you know, a democratic
mechanism, essentially, for going around,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: the inertia, I guess, of policy agendas in
a more sort of conservative and fixed and
[SPEAKER_00]: static environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any state, in any jurisdiction,
you have a set of concerns which reflect
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who are already politically and
economically included in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an initiative usually takes people who
are not already politically and
[SPEAKER_00]: economically included and gets their
message to policymakers and forces their
[SPEAKER_00]: hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly you can see in the
Washington state initiative process,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only did they have to force their
hand, but they told the legislature that
[SPEAKER_00]: they had to lay off the initiative for two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't touch it because it's
understood with an initiative that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing them to do something they don't
want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you got to give it a little room to
breathe before they just kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can see how, actually,
I didn't know that they put in the policy
[SPEAKER_01]: that they couldn't touch it for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I can imagine how that
actually makes everything that much more
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging because not only are the
people pressuring the legislators to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something that they were not necessarily
ready to do or at the very least didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the inertia for, but now suddenly the
legislators have to get educated on best
[SPEAKER_01]: practices and how they want to go about
it, maybe not begrudgingly, but at least
[SPEAKER_01]: on topics that they were not already
educated on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we saw that both in Colorado and
Washington as far as how they're
[SPEAKER_01]: interacting with patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then recently, last legislative
session in Washington with the passing of
[SPEAKER_01]: 50-52, which was erroneously called the
Patient Protection Act, which actually
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of gutted most of the patients'
rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that, you know, so many of
the legislators were being educated by the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial cannabis lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that may be less likely in
states where it's not passed by
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative, where the Congress folks have
got the ability to do their homework in
[SPEAKER_01]: advance first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I kind of agree with you
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one of the things that we're
learning through the cannabis situation is
[SPEAKER_00]: how, in fact, our legislators are
educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact is they're educated usually
by industry and particular special
[SPEAKER_00]: interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the initiative was passed,
there was a period of interest formation,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, in the cannabis industry that kind
of gathered the ones who were a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more organized and had a little more
access.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, they tapped into,
you know, folks who were a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: politically and economically included
already and just used those channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the legislators got educated to the
extent they wanted to be educated on and
[SPEAKER_00]: way more than they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they still don't want to be
educated, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they want to know is what's the
fiscal note?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is this going to cost and how
much is it going to bring in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about the extent of what they
want to know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is kind of the danger of it
going forward, that this will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary education that they will receive
and the primary mode in which they will
[SPEAKER_00]: operate and change laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's interesting, the possibility
that there will be more, instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative, the legislative cannabis
reforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that this has happened with
medical marijuana in particular already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we're probably a long ways off
from a recreational law that's passed by a
[SPEAKER_00]: legislator, unless California happens to
not pass the marijuana act, which it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like they will, but it's up in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, you know, who are the
stakeholders really that are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: forcing legislators to make a decision
really?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what it comes down to is
they're going to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most legislators who are not the primary
sponsors of the bill or otherwise part of
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of political calculus are being
told by their party how to vote basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're still not educated,
Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more work to be done to
actually educate them on anything more
[SPEAKER_00]: than really the fiscal note.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's look at this from the perspective
of states that have not passed
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational or adult use laws yet,
because, you know, so far we've talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about, you know, Alaska and Oregon and
Washington and Colorado, and we're all in
[SPEAKER_01]: the process of sorting this out and
figuring out how to make this work for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are other states that are early
enough in the process that they can take
[SPEAKER_01]: actions to educate their policymakers so
that, you know, A, maybe they get it right
[SPEAKER_01]: the first time or at least closer to
right, and B, they can involve the rule
[SPEAKER_01]: makers in a way where they see the bigger
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, in all of the states
that have passed laws already,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems that the gaps are not that the
people or the legislators are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that they're under-informed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you recommend for folks in
states that have not passed laws yet on
[SPEAKER_01]: how they can get ahead of this and educate
their regulators so that they can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, get something passed from the
beginning that tends to work better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd say that they really have to
understand that they would have to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: off feats of organization that we have
never seen from the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to be very serious about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cannabis community consists of a lot
of people who, as I noted earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: are not already politically and
economically included in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their interests, their militant interests
in cannabis in particular, do not
[SPEAKER_00]: translate well in conversation with
legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, there's a reason for that,
and it's not just because it's about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, it's because they're not part of
the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, you know, tangentially
related to the fact that they consume
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or have radically different
beliefs about punishment in society.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are minority beliefs,
and the only way for a minority to become
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful is to get extremely organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got to say, again, the cannabis
community has never pulled it off,
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in California, at the statewide
level, that initiative that Dennis Perel
[SPEAKER_00]: was running was not going to succeed until
Ethan Nadelman came in with DPA money and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually changed the language a little bit
and also got the money out there for the
[SPEAKER_00]: signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a law to work, our entire culture
has to change, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to change from the bottom up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be more tolerance of,
I think, dissident beliefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dissident beliefs, they're founded on
evidence, in particular, that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: presented logically and as in the
interests of the people who otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of depressing
ideas in that, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it kind of reminds me of that
statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, oh, you go to war with the army
you have, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, you know,
we may want our cannabis scene to get more
[SPEAKER_01]: organized and raise more money and be
deeper in our experience, but this is all
[SPEAKER_01]: happening now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though it's going to be messy
and chaotic, hopefully the more states
[SPEAKER_01]: that legalize, the better we're all going
to get at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can get smoother with
implementation as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and take our first short
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and we're talking with Dominic Korva.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time to really dig into something as
deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there is more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and to
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage loyalty in the customers you
already have, but you certainly don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time and you're not ready to hire
someone full time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blunt Branding principles Kirsten Nelson
and Anthony Garcia are focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging and website
[SPEAKER_01]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is pretty much the most important
part of marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and Anthony will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_01]: of sale, and keep them coming back to you
and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on three
projects now for various clients and every
[SPEAKER_01]: single time they have done more than they
have promised and over-delivered on
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: making me a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, every friend I've referred them
to has come back to thank me, and that
[SPEAKER_01]: just does not happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grab a pen and paper because the
website address is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_01]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_01]: while using cutting edge technology in the
background that make all of this easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: automatic and trackable.

[SPEAKER_01]: makes you money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los,
[SPEAKER_01]: and our guest this week is Dr. Dominic
Korova of the Center for the Study of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis and Social Policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dominic, before the break, we were
talking about the level that legislators
[SPEAKER_01]: were educated at, and your position was
pretty much they know enough to know how
[SPEAKER_01]: to collect taxes, and they want to know
how much tax money they're going to get so
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can add that to the kitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the impact of that is an
incomplete legalization because while
[SPEAKER_01]: people are allowed to purchase cannabis at
stores and commercial entities with
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses are allowed to grow it,
you know, we don't have decent public
[SPEAKER_01]: token laws in most of the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: The home-grow numbers are very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: That creates a situation where people need
to bring their grows indoors to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, get it grown enough for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some states like Washington,
don't even have home-grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really frustrating, folks,
that it feels like we have legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't really because it was only
partial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, considering the fact that we are
making something legal that has been
[SPEAKER_01]: historically taboo for so long,
you know, as someone who studies policy,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you think that this is what we should
expect?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is it too much for us to expect to
get full legalization right off the bat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everybody's all freaked out that
it's legal at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's two things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start with the fact that
really, of course, we are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization basically means taxation or
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it refers specifically to a commodity,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization is about the commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the plant as a commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we exchange money for in
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very different from legalizing,
you know, a culture or a people who tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to use that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they themselves are not viewed as
terribly responsible, desirable citizens
[SPEAKER_00]: in society.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hence the objection to home-growing,
hence the objection to public toking and
[SPEAKER_00]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good news is, point number two,
is that this does actually hit the state
[SPEAKER_00]: in its revenue basket, basically,
especially the public smoking or event
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the home-grow may be a little
less so, but certainly I believe there's
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of incentive for the case to be
made to lawmakers that you increase
[SPEAKER_00]: tourism, that you, you know, increase
opportunities for folks to make money,
[SPEAKER_00]: increase opportunities to collect taxes
and so forth, by allowing for events,
[SPEAKER_00]: by allowing for, you know, the cannabis
cafe, as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think that it's just a matter of
time then that, you know, the legislators
[SPEAKER_01]: are putting themselves on enough of a line
to allow legal cannabis to exist,
[SPEAKER_01]: period?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after people get used to what's
happened so far, then they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: move more into, you know, social,
you know, public social toking places and
[SPEAKER_01]: increased home-grow and things like that,
where we're just, you know, baby stepping
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to depend on lobbyists,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really, it's not about them
getting used to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about essentially the priorities of
the trade organizations that are learning
[SPEAKER_00]: to use lobbyists, maybe a little bit
better than they used to for many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them already were pretty good at
it, but that's common ground for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, no matter which lobbyists we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, that that is a
little higher on the priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Home-grow less so in Washington states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it will probably come around
a little bit more by osmosis and a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more because, you know, every other
state is going to have a home-grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's restrictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as like who those lobbyists
folks are, you know, would you say that in
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the states, you've got one or two
or maybe three pro-commercial lobbyist
[SPEAKER_01]: groups and then maybe one or two kind of
underfunded patient groups?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then while there's certainly a lot of
law enforcement that are in favor of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis reform, you know, you've got
usually a law enforcement lobby that's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to fight it and maybe a concerned
parents and religious organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do they tend to fall in these same
flavors in every state?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, take a look at California alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the makers of fentanyl,
you know, are funding the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the proposition to two and a half
million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pharmaceutical corporation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have way, way more and bigger
interests in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's calculus, you know, calculus four,
you know, as opposed to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: algebra.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the various interests,
how big they are, how widespread they are
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much money there are, as well as
how many lobbyists there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the distributors have a lobbyist
in California in a way that distributors
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a lobbyist in Washington at
this point, not their own particular
[SPEAKER_00]: special interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have much bigger and more powerful
dispensaries in certain areas of the
[SPEAKER_00]: state, which are on their own,
quite distinct in their interests from the
[SPEAKER_00]: producers and processors, as opposed to
here where they all kind of like grew up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit together because we reinvented
the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So California is very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other states, it'll be a little bit more,
you know, more like you described
[SPEAKER_00]: probably, but California is just the big
whale, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what it does affects so much of the
market nationally, even if it's just the
[SPEAKER_00]: California state consumption market,
which obviously it's not, that it will
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bit more of a distorting effect,
I think, on what the other interests have
[SPEAKER_00]: at their disposal in terms of arguments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's going on in California
now, their lobbyist groups have had a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more runway than Colorado and Washington
had because, like you said, we reinvented
[SPEAKER_01]: the wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started from nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone was just trying to get up to
speed to figure out what the hell was
[SPEAKER_01]: going on to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But California not only has got a long
cannabis history, but they've been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: watch policy implementation in the other
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now people are taking their
positions earlier and with more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, California is like the eighth
largest economy in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for better or for worse, it does look
like the Adult Use Marijuana Act is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the passing of that law in California
is probably going to hit the industry like
[SPEAKER_01]: a tsunami.
[SPEAKER_01]: What impact do you see that having on the
national conversation and maybe even more
[SPEAKER_01]: importantly, on the cannabis market
itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me just say that really it was
the reformation of California's Prop 215
[SPEAKER_00]: just a year or two ago that has already
set off the tsunami.
[SPEAKER_00]: You describe because that which is
legislatively driven and also connected
[SPEAKER_00]: with Gavin Newsom's entrepreneurial policy
approach to cannabis politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That set sort of a statewide set of basic
conditions for jurisdictions to license
[SPEAKER_00]: and register the cannabis market per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first two years of it,
it really was about and is about just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like getting your paperwork in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act,
obviously, you know, when it passes,
[SPEAKER_00]: will have another set of things,
but they're not going to be replacing this
[SPEAKER_00]: very recently created medical marijuana
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be intersecting with it
in terms of the rulemaking, the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tsunami has already started,
but also the full how long it takes for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, the rules are set
through like 2020, three in terms of when
[SPEAKER_00]: things happen in terms of permitting and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to be looking at a few
years of, you know, continued volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: growth in California, which of course,
you know, already had the black market
[SPEAKER_00]: tsunami going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot of attention
being focused on the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will bring, I think, new opportunities
for new probably investment players.
[SPEAKER_00]: to participate, but otherwise will be a
continuation of what we've been going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been going on since the 1970s in
California, you know, the green rush has
[SPEAKER_00]: never stopped in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started in the 70s and has never
stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, every year it's gotten
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I arrived in Southern Humboldt five
years ago, everyone thought, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just blown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these strangers come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw, you know, a note on a recent
news article in Humboldt that was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: as though really in the last five years is
when it's really blown up and now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten out of control and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was already hearing that five years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized, well, probably five
years before that, people were saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly the numbers seem to bear out
in terms of California market economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that once California does
pass adult use, that it's just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase investor confidence so that
there's just going to be all of these new
[SPEAKER_01]: investment opportunities and laws passed
in other states, providing like California
[SPEAKER_01]: is like a tipping point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, people talk about all
states as though they're equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we get to half the states with
these laws, then Congress will have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not half the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the right states, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and California is an incredibly
economically powerful state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its politicians will be, you know,
its national politicians are connected
[SPEAKER_00]: from there to the state and local
politicians and political party machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will then be able to carry that to
Congress in a much more competent manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gavin Newsom has really blazed a trail in
terms of, you know, approaching cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, gay marriage in terms of
political capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got ahead of the other politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: He realized, you know, this is the way
society is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way, you know, the public is
viewing things now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can get support out of it as
opposed to it being a third rail that
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody can touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the nationalization and
internationalization of investments into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry alone, the
California situation is going to open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will probably be the biggest
reverberator in terms of how the messages
[SPEAKER_00]: get national.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they haven't even voted yet and
you can already feel it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feel people, you know,
expecting it to pass and therefore they're
[SPEAKER_01]: jumping in early and getting their ducks
in a row and getting their money raised
[SPEAKER_01]: and making their contacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just feel it's like a whole bunch
of cars that are lined up at a starting
[SPEAKER_01]: gate and they're all revving their engines
and burning oil and all ready for it to
[SPEAKER_01]: pass in November to make the whole thing a
reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually rather enormous and
startling actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I mean, I feel like those
engines have been revving for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: while now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the interesting things
that I think California, the biggest thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for California, at least Northern
California, is that I think that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see the opening up really of more
liberal zoning laws actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you understand this,
but certainly like in the Bay Area,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, why don't they have hundreds of
dispensers in the Bay Area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because, you know, over the last 10,
15 years, they reacted to medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana by almost immediately,
you know, making it impossible for there
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a location for folks to sell it in a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that they made it, they outlawed
it, they zoned it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this process will allow
for the zoning in of properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially of retail stores, because it is
kind of ridiculous that the Bay Area has
[SPEAKER_00]: actually so few retail cannabis spots
compared to, you know, Southern California
[SPEAKER_00]: or LA, for example, and probably the
highest capital consumption of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of that, you know, I think going
through the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's interesting to think about
that because, you know, you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this has already been happening
for some time, but it seems like the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry as a whole has been held back by
the fact that they haven't really gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: the full legal green light, which tends to
keep all of this, you know, legal capital
[SPEAKER_01]: on the sidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while California has obviously had
this rolling green rush since the 70s,
[SPEAKER_01]: there were natural, you know, barriers to
entry simply because your money wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of the legal money found it
as too high of risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now suddenly that's all going to be
open and there's going to be this gushing
[SPEAKER_01]: influx of new investment capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be very interesting to see how
much repetition in the market there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine that there's probably
going to be this huge swelling in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market and then, you know, probably a
bubble and then a shaking out of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, secondary and tertiary players
that just don't have it in them to hang in
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going to be such a competitive
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but so much of California is already
oriented outside the state anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the newer investors that are
trying to capture, you know, California
[SPEAKER_00]: state consumption are probably are not
thinking about this the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use California to jump into
the national market, not to use California
[SPEAKER_00]: to jump into the California market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now the issue is that
legalization is still about California and
[SPEAKER_00]: California's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, what Alma allows you to
do is write maybe a business plan with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more confidence over a longer
timeframe, because, you know, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have an initiative coming up every year as
a possibility to change things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now you kind of have a little
bit longer site and can see how it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can identify, you know, which parts of
California are particularly ripe for,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's call it what it is, you know,
transitioning from, you know, black
[SPEAKER_00]: markets oversupply into, you know,
white market regulated channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's going to hold that up is
going to be taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's still going to be more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in California, you know, a lot more
expensive than the black market,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is absolutely full of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the investors are not, you know,
pouring their money into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to, you know, transform or
capture as much of the black market as
[SPEAKER_00]: they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will be running straight into the
desire of policymakers to put a huge tax
[SPEAKER_00]: on it, a series of huge taxes,
local, state, county.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting out low.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting out lower than we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously ours is probably, you know,
at 34%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody else can be starting
with that, but our 34 is another nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: plus, you know, whatever else people put
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to be starting at 17
in California, probably at the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to get, you know,
what is there in the Bay Area?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's already a 5% in Oakland,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the investor money has to go
towards something very concrete with a
[SPEAKER_00]: business plan that they understand
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that the money really should
be going into probably branding,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the first thing that gets
to jump state lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they want to do is probably gobble up
the smaller actors, buy them out or take
[SPEAKER_00]: their brand and, you know, put it on
steroids, you know, really ready it for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, something bigger than the
California market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really insightful when you
say that California more than being its
[SPEAKER_01]: own market interest is actually just the
gateway, if you will, to the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: national market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, since there is not federal
legalization yet, it's kind of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: minor leagues where everybody is getting
trained and ready for federal
[SPEAKER_01]: normalization when then they can then roll
out to the rest of the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we need to take another short break.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look inside this crystal ball with me for
a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking just a couple months into the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing the future of the Shaping Fire
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show sure has grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've continued to interview fascinating
cannabis industry luminaries and our
[SPEAKER_01]: audience has gotten huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has doubled and redoubled and doubled
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are high fives all around the
Shaping Fire world headquarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: New listeners are subscribing every day
and begin to listen to the back catalog of
[SPEAKER_01]: all the great interviews there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is where the Shaping Fire
audience learns about your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were incredibly smart today to become
an early adopter and place a commercial in
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire's early episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, today, you are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: pay a fraction of the cost we'll be asking
in just two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet all the audience that listens to
our back catalog of interviews will hear
[SPEAKER_01]: about your company again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
so new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_01]: listening audience we will have forever.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Lois, and our guest
this week is Dr. Dominic Korva of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Center for the Study of Cannabis and
Social Policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, Dominic, we were
talking about how important California was
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's the eighth largest economy in
the world and how even more than just
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to open business there for its own
sake, because California is such a big
[SPEAKER_01]: market, of how it's actually a gateway to
the rest of the nation once federal
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization takes place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, folks who are looking ahead
on how their businesses are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: evolve over, say, the next 10 years,
they have to be aware of the possibility
[SPEAKER_01]: of international players as well,
because once we get to the point that
[SPEAKER_01]: product can move across state lines,
so someone might be able to produce it in
[SPEAKER_01]: California or Texas and then ship it to
Connecticut or Colorado, or Arkansas,
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, once those borders are sorted
out, you know that there's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: people pushing to be able to start
bringing in product internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, places like Mexico and Uruguay
are already thinking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's grow outdoor cannabis here,
let's convert it into oil, and let's ship
[SPEAKER_01]: that to the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do you think of is the
likelihood that that will be an aggressive
[SPEAKER_01]: timeline that will happen rather quickly
because, you know, there's a lot of folks
[SPEAKER_01]: who are planning on producing cannabis oil
in the U.S., but if suddenly Mexican
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis oil is coming in, you know,
to be used in edibles and all,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this huge market, you know,
that's going to just crush the prices
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see in your crystal ball as
far as that's concerned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's already happening with CBD,
you know, in terms of international lines
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's against the law, but the policy seems
to be to let it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was contacted recently by some CBD
company that, you know, opened up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle, and I don't know what they
thought I did, but, you know, they wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: me to, you know, get some advertising from
them or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, you know, I was like,
well, you know, first of all, I can't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a federal nonprofit, 501C3,
and we don't do, you know, we don't buy or
[SPEAKER_00]: sell cannabis, you know, we're a research
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing is obviously the
international hemp oil scene, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of it was in China, probably still
is, but a lot of it is now coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, from German hemp and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's being, you know, shipped
absolutely across international lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being shipped products that aren't
approved by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being shipped and powder crystals and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening, especially through CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you're right, you know,
you got to look at other countries that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be willing to export and able
to export to other countries before
[SPEAKER_00]: they're able to export to the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colombia, right off the bat,
is planning on essentially, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: treating cannabis like coca in terms of
medical cannabis and exporting it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of Latin America, like Bolivia and
Peru export certainly coca leaves to other
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of Latin America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Colombia is already on that
in Latin America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens elsewhere in South
Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in India, certainly there's Dr.
Sunil Agarwal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to ask him a little bit more
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the South Asian markets
will cross borders, although you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the Philippines right there and they're
ready to kill anybody who's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: accused of being a drug dealer right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have some weird things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that with the United States,
it is going to be a while before it's able
[SPEAKER_00]: to cross state lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually might put us behind in
terms of our ability to export our own
[SPEAKER_00]: product because Colombia will have had
practice, maybe India will have had
[SPEAKER_00]: practice and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way things work here, you got to
look at our trade agreements, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moment you start seeing cannabis,
medical cannabis or otherwise start to be
[SPEAKER_00]: written into trade agreements is when you
start to get it across the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have NAFTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have TPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have CAPTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, you know, actually an
interlocking, you know, Byzantine maze of
[SPEAKER_00]: trade agreements all over the world as a
result of the last 30 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: globalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, those things, I think they
change slower than our drug policy laws
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing that I would say is
that we're going to develop our own
[SPEAKER_00]: internal possibly export market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even we'll start to get,
if Congress doesn't act after California
[SPEAKER_00]: does, maybe we'll start to get like a West
Coast trade zone for cannabis or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, that starts to open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to be in fits and starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, it's a little unpredictable,
but certainly I don't think it's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's happening outside of our
country very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Colombia is going to be doing it
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not to the United States, but to other
Latin American countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many, there's so much to chew
on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for speculation that seems to
suggest that, you know, American
[SPEAKER_01]: investment capital that wants to get
involved with cannabis might be better
[SPEAKER_01]: informed by investing in the third world
since they're going to be moving faster
[SPEAKER_01]: because they've got a smaller regulatory
structure and perhaps less trade
[SPEAKER_01]: agreements to worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, it's interesting to consider
that, you know, the various, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: protectionist ways that the United States
goes about things could actually put us in
[SPEAKER_01]: the back seat as far as international
trade on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I guess the idea that folks are
already doing it now, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing, you know, crystallized CBD from
hemp and from China and everything really
[SPEAKER_01]: shows how often policy can be made by
selective enforcement because it's already
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the time being, they don't seem to
be enforcing against it, which suddenly
[SPEAKER_01]: default makes it pseudo legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a weird kind of version of,
you know, our own, you know, medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis laws from years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This default kind of like, you know,
policy of black enforcement or lower
[SPEAKER_00]: priority of enforcement, which opens
things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it would be very difficult now
to, I think, you know, take down all the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are importing hemp products in
terms of, you know, international
[SPEAKER_00]: financial capital investing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll tell you exactly how that
works, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So international financial capital,
especially when it comes to agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: products, is about real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about buying the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about making money off of these
very, very cheap, perishable, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Latin America is not going
to be treating, you know, cannabis as
[SPEAKER_00]: anything other than an agricultural
commodity, a medical one, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's not going to be an,
you know, added value industrial product
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that what you got to look at
is, you know, where people buy property,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also distribution, international
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that that's something we
didn't touch on in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very important part of the scene is
that folks who want to make a bundle off
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis distribution is probably going
to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't kind of happen that way in
Washington, but that's one of the ways in
[SPEAKER_00]: which California is going to show these
other little states, essentially with the
[SPEAKER_00]: little cannabis markets, how it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that distributors are going
to play a huge role, especially because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way we have all these various
compliance issues with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tracking of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll continue to do so for the
foreseeable future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that intersection of tracking and
distribution is going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at international financial
capital, look at where it buys land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we go too far away from the
international topic, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is an important point to
point out for folks who are considering
[SPEAKER_01]: getting, you know, processing licenses in
their own state, because folks,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're gauging their risk,
they're thinking, okay, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that the marijuana is going to
sell and we know that there's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: brands from our state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so since we know that, you know,
essentially the sales cycle for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: at the beginning is do you have weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sold, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That a lot of people jump in just
believing that if they can get the
[SPEAKER_01]: license, if they can set up their
business, if they can just stay in
[SPEAKER_01]: business and find enough capital,
that their product is guaranteed to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it's going to be a decade
before, you know, any kind of cannabis oil
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be imported from, say,
Mexico, you know, 10 years is not a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time when investing a half million dollars
in setting up a processing company at the
[SPEAKER_01]: state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's a good time to
remind folks to gauge their risk and not
[SPEAKER_01]: get in over their heads, because,
you know, this cascade of one tsunami
[SPEAKER_01]: after another, and then the law changes
and now suddenly, you know, the potential
[SPEAKER_01]: for state to state transfer and then
international, it's going to be a bucking
[SPEAKER_01]: bronco ride for, you know, a good 20
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people should make sure that they're
ready for that before they invest their
[SPEAKER_01]: retirement capital into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really don't think that there's as
much of that, you know, retirement capital
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of investments that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the startups, certainly for our
states, we're a little more like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, what investment capital
likes to do is merge and acquire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll be going around looking for
failing businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make people an offer they can't
refuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they build their portfolio
essentially of real estate and production
[SPEAKER_00]: sites that are going to network together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way for the big guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's also the way for the
smaller guys, the folks who actually want
[SPEAKER_00]: to hang in there and be a part of this
instead of build it up and sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a common entrepreneurial,
you know, notion is that they are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to, you know, form cooperative
enterprises of some sort, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you have a horizontal merging
going on as opposed to vertical merging,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're going to be able to,
I think, be a little more resilient than
[SPEAKER_00]: if you just insist on sticking it out on
your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a really good point just
because, you know, I've talked to so many
[SPEAKER_01]: folks in Washington and Colorado and
Oregon who have, you know, started their
[SPEAKER_01]: mom and pop businesses with the intention
of going national.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean that's how it's going to
be going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good point because now
that, you know, traditional investment
[SPEAKER_01]: capital is feeling more confident and the
risk is decreasing, we're going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: more businesses taken over by acquisition
and by, you know, more traditional capital
[SPEAKER_01]: sources where it's not just going to be
mom and pops that then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: get elevated to the big leagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that capital is used to a
higher amount of risk than, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: me losing my retirement capital because I
gave it to my uncle, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, when it comes down to it,
a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: investment when it comes down to it,
I think in the 502 system started with
[SPEAKER_00]: $250 and everybody who actually paid that
250 bucks and got an application for
[SPEAKER_00]: something in that little 30 day window
that we did not know would be pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: the only window where that could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those licenses became
commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They became commodities when, even if
they're failing, they became commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, you know, you've lost everything,
you can still sell that license basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the window for investment in
the system for the smaller folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was it, to be honest,
you know, in terms of the direct handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be tough to break into
retail when they open up new retail
[SPEAKER_00]: windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state's going to want the same
retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want people who have
proven that it's been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want people from the list
they already have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of ways, that dynamic is the same
as the New York taxi token, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: where, you know, you're buying and selling
these for, you know, a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand dollars or whatever, because
they're limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've become a commodity themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limited edition, scarce resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, very good, Dominic.
