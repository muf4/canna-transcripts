[SPEAKER_03]: Providing your own cannabis is exploding
across the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks are self-contained,
growing and smoking their own flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some neighbors are working in small
groups, with some neighbors growing while
[SPEAKER_03]: others are turning the flower into
edibles, tincture, bubble hash,
[SPEAKER_03]: and hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many options for making high
quality cannabis products without
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive equipment or hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Communities of cannabis patients and
enthusiasts are coming together to be
[SPEAKER_03]: self-sufficient.

[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, my guest is Ganja Gill,
the Ice Wook.
[SPEAKER_03]: I connected with Gill after watching a
video of him giving best practices for
[SPEAKER_03]: making regeneratively minded hash at the
Dragonfly Earth Medicine Hive Gathering
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gill is a lifelong cannabis cultivator and
hash maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's your hash maker's hash maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: His hard-to-find hash and hash rosin are
sought after by heads throughout
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gill is incredibly difficult to connect
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lives way out in the forest and doesn't
often return to town.
[SPEAKER_03]: We eventually were able to connect via
satellite phone to record this episode for
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, we're going to talk about fine
tuning your ice water hash production,
[SPEAKER_03]: some tricks of the trade, and why making
quality hash is a love language.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show, Gill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people, the first thing
that they learn about when they start
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to figure out how they're going to
make ice hashes at home is about hash
[SPEAKER_03]: bags, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, hash bags have now been
around a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, there are the original
bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now there's a whole bunch of
knockoffs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, some of the knockoffs are
pretty damn good too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious for yourself, what do you look
for when you are buying a hash bag?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my first set was a bottom mesh,
and I liked that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I'm seeing these new ones that
have got mesh on all sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of covet those as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a frugal person by nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know me, that's just how I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to garden as inexpensively as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to extraction,
I kind of think the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't try to cut corners per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am often making this in a home
setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really in a lab-like situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, not necessarily cutting corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also not trying to spend tens of
thousands of dollars to accomplish what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having said that, affordability is
important to me personally, simply because
[SPEAKER_00]: if you wash fresh frozen material,
you're going to destroy bags just the way
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stay on top of cleaning your bags,
which I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually, the bags get ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're washing dried material,
they seem to last longer in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, they just don't last
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see some bags out there these days
that are getting more and more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And personally, they kind of turn me off
just to the extent that I see them as
[SPEAKER_00]: disposable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having said that at the same time,
if you're washing as much material as I
[SPEAKER_00]: am, it's very small expense, the bags and
the grand scheme of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of being vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not giving a real straight answer
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I personally do use bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've always worked for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using them almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give me good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They last long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get them for a very affordable
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen now Marcus just dropped all side
mesh walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am interested in trying those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to try those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what were you going to say,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say when you're looking at
bags, are you looking primarily at the
[SPEAKER_03]: like the quality of the stitching and the
material itself and whether or not it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom or a sidewall?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is there something else, another
variable that you look at in addition to
[SPEAKER_03]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stitching is probably mainly what it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, you can kind of get a good gauge on
how quality something's made by looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual stitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitching is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Materials that they're made is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get really, really
technical, you magnify.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look under a microscope at the actual
mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that not all mesh is created
equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are using less professional mesh
than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people are using really
professional mesh like companies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: using more accurate micron sizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sizing that is inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's a 90U bag, then the spacing is
for 90U.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found sometimes looking at other
brands real close under the scope,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might not be what they're claiming it
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be just from simple error
or just using more generic screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, that is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be actually capturing what you
are intending to capture for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bags are important, but like I've made
great hash with all bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where I'm at is like,
I don't really want to hop on the hype
[SPEAKER_00]: train.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a particular brand of bags out
there that I'm not going to mention that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone promotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And personally, me, I had a terrible
customer service experience with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really turned me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not use that product anymore
because that's just what type of stubborn
[SPEAKER_00]: asshole I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, me personally, I don't put much
weight in the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's a certain level of
quality that should be brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, I've had people
send me these random bags from random
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bag, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to me, that's not going to make it or
break it for you personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I stand by bubble man's product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely other ones out there
that are decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be scared of anything with a really
high ticket item.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd also be scared to maybe use
something that was extremely inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what's really important first and
foremost is just clean the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your bags when you get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get your bags, clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean them, clean them, clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean them 12 times if you have to because
I've had to before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cleaned bags before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to do a wash and then you see
fibers in your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing more disheartening
than to go months of growing resin,
[SPEAKER_00]: extracting the resin, and then looking
down and realizing the bags that you
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased have actually contaminated the
resin that you just harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that is just the biggest kick in
the nuts I've experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, personally, not all bags are
created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't trip out on what bags you have
available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure they're nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seem solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what's all that's
important to me personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like the mesh sidewalls, the all mesh
as someone who works by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I kind of just started
playing with this past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see that Bubble Man came
out with some.
[SPEAKER_00]: They save your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pulling large washes by yourself
all day every day, those all mesh ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely really nice in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something to be said for them for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are different sizes of sets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody kind of has their own
thoughts on what their favorite bags,
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite microns on bags are to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my first set was a nine set.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were several of the bags that I
just never fricking used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you get people who are selling
three, four, five bag sets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they cost a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not paying money for bags that
you're not using.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts as far as how many
bags are the best to buy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use all nine of yours?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you're like, in the end, we're probably
only gonna use four.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a four set will be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it just depends what your goals
are, what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, I make a lot of hash rosin,
but I also make a lot of just hash melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, they are two different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wash for them differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're washing, for more of a full
spectrum hash rosin type situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: less bags is the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for more of a melt
situation, to me is use all the bags you
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you don't know what you're
trying to make, that the strain or the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar you're using dictates what you're
gonna make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're gonna wash something for the
first time, sometimes I tell people do a
[SPEAKER_00]: test wash and use all your bags,
use all your bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show you where it dumped and where
it didn't dump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it might let you know,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't really all that much 73
anyways in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can negate that bag and throw it
into the 90 if we wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's just hypothetical
situation that I'm describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably very rarely put the 73 in
the 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there's just situations that
you wouldn't really know until you wash
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you know what.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the size of the heads are and where
it's spitting and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more bags for melt, less bags for
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never use a 25U bag to me that just
slows down the draining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never grabbed anything from a 25
micron bag that I felt like was worth
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm gonna do a full spectrum hash
wash, I'll typically wash in a 220.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep the 190, the 160, the 90,
and the 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much those four bags that I'm
filtering through for the full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the melt,
like I said, I'm gonna use all eight of
[SPEAKER_00]: those bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you really think that there,
as far as making connoisseur grade versus
[SPEAKER_03]: regular toker grade, outside of the little
pieces of material that might get in your
[SPEAKER_03]: finished product, which of course sucks as
you've already referred to, I would think
[SPEAKER_03]: that mediocre bags plus good technique
could make killer hash the same way that
[SPEAKER_03]: great bags and crappy technique could
equal poor hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I generally encourage people to buy
the bags that fit their budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: But go heavy on care preparation and
technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: That totally makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where I am at with mechanical
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis and extracting it
inflates egos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something that I've come across
in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is about the nature
of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am just here to say, I really,
really try to portray that I have no ego
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always the ganja doing the
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always the ganja that is turning
heads, impressing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mechanical extraction is simply not that
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I like to describe it to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are better at cooking than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the people that are better at
cooking are just better at following
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they might even have a little bit
of passion about it as well to add to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can mechanically extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have passion about it, you're going
to pursue it with more passion and more
[SPEAKER_00]: focus and more drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you'll probably be better at
someone who's being forced to do it for an
[SPEAKER_00]: hourly wage job, which doesn't make sense
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's probably going on somewhere in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, it's not that
hard to mechanically extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it comes down to is the material,
the material, the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're extracting great material,
it's going to be easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some mediocre stuff,
it's just always going to be mediocre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you can extract, make amazing hash
with decent bags and great cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: with decent cannabis and great bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually, the first time that I came
across you, I was actually watching a
[SPEAKER_03]: video and you were talking about the
choosing of material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I first got turned on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, this guy really approaches
making ice hash in the way that I value.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were talking about some of the
attributes that you look for when choosing
[SPEAKER_03]: hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you also said, as you've kind of
referred to earlier already, that the
[SPEAKER_03]: ganja will tell you what application will
be best for it and what bags to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to kind of give you this
broad question so that you can kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: take us through your thought process.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you choose material?
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're examining material to
potentially wash, what are you looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a different situation with people
than to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, I am only focused and for years
now, I've only been focused on processing
[SPEAKER_00]: my own material that I grow myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of easier answer than could
be where it's like I freeze everything I
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and I wash everything I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really a debate of,
hey, am I going to wash this or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm growing it, I'm washing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I am only washing my own
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really going to other farms and
looking and seeing like, oh, is this
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially something I should wash?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really necessarily going on
because that's not what I'm doing with my
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do just in theory walk a lot of
farms and wonder, hey, would this wash,
[SPEAKER_00]: would that wash?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it comes down to two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the texture of the resin and the
structure of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking for first and
foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can touch that resin and I can see
heads on my hand, it's that dry resin that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can literally just touch a flower,
move your hand and you will see heads on
[SPEAKER_00]: your fingertips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that super sticky resin that like
just so sticky that it just leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, just a smear on your hand and
there you won't see the heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also a structure of flower that
exposes a lot of surface area is how I
[SPEAKER_00]: describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily really large, dense
spears, but stuff that actually exposes
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface area, you know, allowing the
material to to come off, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, making it where it gives it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I prep the material, that's another
big part of the process as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: is you really want to break the stuff down
as much as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, certain structure of flower
allows you to break it down naturally to
[SPEAKER_00]: very small and then other structure of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really big and it just doesn't lend
itself to being broken all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the two things that I look
for first and foremost is basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: the texture of the resin and the structure
of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously I'm forgetting just the
smell, the overall aroma and smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, of something isn't appealing to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell, I don't really care about
washing it, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's the greatest resin in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many years ago, we all used to wash a
bunch of ogre and it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, it dumped ogre.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just so much resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just didn't really have much of a smell or
anything to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all forgotten about it at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of got to be terpy
first and foremost, especially in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to come with something really loud
and something to get your attention these
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are good suggestions for,
you know, if we're shopping around for a
[SPEAKER_03]: flower that we're going to run or for
confirming the flower that we're here to
[SPEAKER_03]: have that we want to run it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like this idea, though, which,
you know, I had not come across before I
[SPEAKER_03]: talked to you about somebody who
exclusively grows their own stuff and then
[SPEAKER_03]: washes their own stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: For people who are listening who like that
idea, you know, when you are choosing the
[SPEAKER_03]: flower that you're going to grow for a
season, you know, if you're going to run a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of it, that's a lot of commitment to
grow a lot of that one plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you, for example, run a couple trial
plants, you know, summer one, and then if
[SPEAKER_03]: you like it, you start earlier in the
season and start those plants again and
[SPEAKER_03]: clone them and put them in your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that you have it in volume the next
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's kind of a way for me to
back into how do you choose what cultivars
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I know that you're primarily an
outdoor guy, I kind of think that
[SPEAKER_03]: generally you need to test it one summer
and then go big with it the following
[SPEAKER_03]: summer, unless you've got a different
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that would be a very well
calculated way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am blessed enough to live in,
you know, the cannabis hub of the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, which is Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am surrounded by ganja people who,
you know, all we do is talk, speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: eat, sleep ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, through that,
there is just certain cultivars out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that we know perform and hash mechanical
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, there's just kind of been
tried and true ones that we all know work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, people have then begun
breeding with those same tried and true
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's certain genetics
that you begin to be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you know that they perform a lot
of clone only strains are floating around
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County that we've all determined,
you know, these ones wash, these ones
[SPEAKER_00]: don't wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fortunately, I'm in that position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I have access to solid genetics
that, you know, myself and others have
[SPEAKER_00]: tried over the years, and we know they
perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, having said that, over the years,
I have been growing a lot of these what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call them now classics, you know,
classic mechanical extraction strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: classic, you know, solventless strains
like, you know, garlic cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO, we all know it dumps strawberry
banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know it dumps key lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's cookies and cream,
you know, there's all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: things out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla glue, sour diesel, you know,
we can just keep naming them wedding cake,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the cakes, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different things that we know
for a fact wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's real easy to plant those and just
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from my mistakes and don't put all
your eggs in one basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, don't grow one variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll grow multiple, you know,
grow, you know, as many as you can within
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, you know, that can become a
problem to just having too many things
[SPEAKER_00]: that becomes a burden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think diversity is
definitely a good approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely running some tried and true
things is always wise as far as a business
[SPEAKER_00]: goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not going to pretend that I don't
chase turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is something extremely exciting
about growing strains that you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're going to wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got it from a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of breeders these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're breeding for hash, you know,
awning noodles, hairy palms, exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic mikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are all these different
guys that are out there that are breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly for hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, there's these sure bets where
you can get the clones that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: wash, you can try to get the seeds from
the guy who's breeding for hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right now, my second round is all
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all seeds, all different phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm doing it with the intention that
hopefully a wall washes, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're definitely hash crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them are going to come,
but some of them are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of just the life of a hash
maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as a hash maker, I have beaten
it many times, throwing thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars in barrels to get nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's just kind of the nature
of being a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is definitely some faith involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, you have to be in it for
reasons that, you know, you have some
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that you want answered,
or you have some things that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: discover yourself potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing the research through washing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not all home runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all grand slams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much ups and downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking to a guy at an after party
after Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually don't know his name,
but he said to me, he says, the worst hash
[SPEAKER_03]: he makes is hash that he's making for
money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best hash that he's makes is stuff
that he's making because he's passionate
[SPEAKER_03]: about the cultivar, or he's making it for
he and his friends to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that makes total sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, you know, it's all about
intention in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell a lot of people, you know,
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can make money, you know,
totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry is profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to try to act like it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people that flock here strictly
for profits, strictly for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell them all all the time, like there's
so much easier ways in this life to make
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really your sole focus is to make
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, there's easier ways to get
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money comes and money goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can get rich growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people who come here solely for
the money, they fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they spend lots of money and
have these like, you know, crazy ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't seem to pan out to those
people, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like to me, you know,
passion and cannabis are intertwined.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's this thing where I pursue
it because that's what I choose to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the money is like a secondary
thing that just comes along with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be honest, you know, but what keeps me
interested in cannabis is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's the biggest rabbit hole
that ever existed in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can go down any road,
talk about anything, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to talk about soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients, you know, environment,
strains, you know, like extraction is just
[SPEAKER_00]: another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a small piece of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many other facets of extraction
that we can talk about, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, extraction is just one way
to to look into cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at it more closely, to learn more
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a way to focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your intent is how I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like as a cannabis grower,
what are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's so many different
avenues that you could be taking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, are you trying to produce for
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to grow the most?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to grow just a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are your intentions?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, me personally, once I started
focusing towards hash, it just all made
[SPEAKER_00]: sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything clicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, oh, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I'm growing is for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different things, in my opinion,
growing for extraction and growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: flower production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they kind of lead different
lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a I can see how that is also
like the perspective of a true,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, passionate artisan, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're doing it for your heart as as
well as surviving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I personally think it's really great,
you know, as as really premium hash rosins
[SPEAKER_03]: and and even melt become increasingly
popular in the scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to see high quality product
fetching good prices from a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's always been a hash
market, but this, you know, the the the
[SPEAKER_03]: market for elite hash and really good hash
rosin is certainly exploding right now and
[SPEAKER_03]: is becoming this, you know, increasingly
large part of our scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last question I want to ask you about
the choosing of material is, do you have
[SPEAKER_03]: any insight on washing indoor material
versus washing outdoor material?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk to you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk about that all day if you
wanted to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could just go back and forth about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that is a that is a interesting
subject to me personally, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, for the past, I think it's seven
years now, I've been cultivating solely
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hung up the indoor towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only been outdoors for seven years,
you know, running some nursery inside here
[SPEAKER_00]: and there, some moms and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't really flowered indoors in
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's definitely this, you know,
thing going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like in the community where people
are convinced indoor flower is superior
[SPEAKER_00]: than outdoor flower and therefore indoor
grown resin is superior than outdoor grown
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, I do not believe that could
be further from the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor will always, you know, require a
higher ticket because it has a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: overhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am not going to argue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if something costs more to
produce inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, get more for it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you grow more aesthetically pleasing,
pretty flowers indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're in a sealed room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's literally sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in an outdoor environment with
fluctuating light patterns, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: different weather, you know, not to
mention insects, wind and all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: above.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some things going on outdoors
that you just can't control, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we are trying to make clean
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the goal of a hash maker,
is to make very clean resin that is simply
[SPEAKER_00]: just resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously that is easier to do indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in a sealed environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's easier to keep contaminant
out of indoor grown resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of people I know who I
see extracting indoors, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be doing melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you should do is make melt because
it's so easy to make clean melt in an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not grown outside with the dust
flying around and everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indoor, it's very easy, in my opinion,
to create clean resin, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the sun produces terpene levels
and compounds and flavors and things that
[SPEAKER_00]: no lamp could ever do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see these terp results and these even
just potency tests from same cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: grown outside versus inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the terp levels are quadrupled.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, you can't argue with data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have very rarely seen like terp levels
that have rivaled outdoor ones in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they exist?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, it's easier to grow more
complex terpene profiles outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: great outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also will just always stand by the
fact that there's all these things that
[SPEAKER_00]: come into play when you're growing
outdoors, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to me, things that I like to think
about, you know, that to me are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like these romantic ideals about cannabis
growing, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I like the idea that cannabis grown
in Southern California is different than
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stuff in Washington is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to see how humidity and
elevation and, you know, terroir and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that plays a role in the production of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, indoor growing is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got awesome homies who have dedicated
their life to it and they're doing amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my homies in Rhode Island,
Liberty LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing amazing things with living
soil inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Cantwell in Vegas, Green Life
Productions blows my mind every time I see
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the luxury of walking here last
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the greatest indoor
facilities I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not trying to take away from what
people are doing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many states don't allow outdoor
cultivation, so you can only do what you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, for me
personally, I much rather enjoy working
[SPEAKER_00]: with outdoor resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, people grow larger plants
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just proportional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger plants mean larger trichome heads,
larger yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy working with the resin outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it's more able to be
captured.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find a lot of times the stuff indoors is
very greasy, very, very hard to capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's great qualities about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's nothing wrong with
greasy resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides the fact that it's hard to
capture, you know, so there's great things
[SPEAKER_00]: all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can grow great resin indoors
and you can grow great resin outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously am biased because what I'm
focused on is growing outside and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: because I live in a great region for
growing cannabis outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wasn't, I would obviously be growing
it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't bother me that indoor commands a
higher premium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole rhetoric of indoor resin is
better because it was grown indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I've seen a lot of indoor
stuff that like wasn't really turned in my
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that is probably the most elegant
and insightful comparison of indoor and
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor that I have ever heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was beautifully put together and
that's probably informed a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's nice too, to hear a kind of a
summation of the pros and cons,
[SPEAKER_03]: which kind of like satisfies both the
indoor people and satisfies the outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: people since you spoke to like the clear
advantages of both.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go ahead and take our first short
break.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is hash maker Ganja Gill,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Ice Wook.
[SPEAKER_03]: For many, transitioning to organic
gardening can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much to learn about soil
biology and fermentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bioflux fermented plant boost from
Everflux simplifies organic farming so you
[SPEAKER_03]: can start growing organically today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Invented by a California farmer growing
organic for 40 years, Bioflux is a
[SPEAKER_03]: fermented natural farming preparation for
those who want a natural micro booster
[SPEAKER_03]: without having to brew their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: This extraordinary chemical free growth
and terpene enhancer improves root
[SPEAKER_03]: development, accelerates the conversion of
organic matter into humus, increases
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient use efficiency and uptake and
increases beneficial microbe activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to the Bioflux fermented plant
booster, Everflux also makes an activated
[SPEAKER_03]: biochar called teraflux that is infused
with the Bioflux plant booster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine combining the buffering and
rhizosphere enhancing qualities of biochar
[SPEAKER_03]: infused with a range of earthworm
castings, insect frass, kelp and crab
[SPEAKER_03]: meal, oyster shell and other ingredients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using teraflux infused biochar this
summer myself and it smells alive,
[SPEAKER_03]: rich and potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: These products have been scientifically
proven to match yields and increase flower
[SPEAKER_03]: quality and pest resistance when compared
to traditional NPK inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are looking for reliable organic
fertilizers that will free you up to focus
[SPEAKER_03]: on other aspects of your garden,
consider using the range of all natural
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative fertilizers and natural bio
stimulants from Everflux.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out more at EverfluxTechnologies.com
or by following their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_03]: Everflux.
[SPEAKER_03]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a replacement for using peat
[SPEAKER_03]: moss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_03]: container growing, but organic growers
know that peat moss is an unsustainable
[SPEAKER_03]: resource and the mining of peat bogs
destroys habitat and releases sequestered
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now there's finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that shares the
[SPEAKER_03]: same benefits while also being
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peat moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_03]: ecosystems, it actually is made from
upcycled organic paper and tree bark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peat moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_03]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peat moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption and water conservation
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carefully and locally sourced,
peat moss is the result of decades-long
[SPEAKER_03]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peat moss has the fluffy nature of peat
moss and handles exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like peat moss, peat moss is inert,
so it won't change your pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: Available in a range of preparations
including a nutrient-enhanced blend,
[SPEAKER_03]: a coco coir blend, and also as an organic
soil conditioner with no added nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peat moss is also available as an animal
bedding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go to pitmoss.com now to learn more.

[SPEAKER_03]: For 20 years, Humboldt Seed Company has
been family-owned in providing reliable,
[SPEAKER_03]: high-yielding seeds originating in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_03]: While the current trend is to slap one
super-male into a line of hype strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt Seed Company continues to breed
with precision and care by doing large
[SPEAKER_03]: sifts and back-crosses to emphasize the
absolute best traits that a line has to
[SPEAKER_03]: offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: This kind of breeding takes time,
talent and space to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter what kind of aroma you are
particularly fond of, Humboldt Seed will
[SPEAKER_03]: likely have something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you love fruit, you can choose from
banana, mango, apricot, papaya,
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry, blood orange, melon,
and lemons across their various strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have all-gas, glue, and classic sour
diesel lines as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, there are the heritage
California strains like OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Hare, and Headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their award-winning blueberry muffin
is one that delights just about
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's palate, especially when
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt Seed Company is proud to bring to
market the infamous freak show cultivar 2,
[SPEAKER_03]: which has a great THC high but looks so
much like a fern that some folks can't
[SPEAKER_03]: even identify it as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a plant that really needs to be seen
to be believed.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for well-balanced CBD
seeds, Humboldt Seed Company can turn you
[SPEAKER_03]: on to CBD strains that actually have
flavor, like the dill and pepper terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: of Willie G.'s Lebanese Land Race.

[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt Seed Company, let them know
Shango sent ya.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is hash maker Ganja Gill,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Ice Wook.
[SPEAKER_03]: So during the first set, we were talking a
lot about the types of bags and the
[SPEAKER_03]: materials that you needed just to kind of
get us started.
[SPEAKER_03]: But during the second set, we're gonna
talk a lot more about the actual process
[SPEAKER_03]: of manufacturing and mechanically
separating the heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Gill, let's start with temperature of
the location.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people have got these very,
very expensive locations with like a
[SPEAKER_03]: gazillion watts of air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really like visiting those places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of really high quality hash
comes out of those locations.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, I know that I've hung
out with my friends and we have washed on
[SPEAKER_03]: a deck on a summer day where our washing
machine is like in the shade, but we're in
[SPEAKER_03]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're having as much social time and
enjoying ourselves as we are making the
[SPEAKER_03]: hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've also made good hash not in a
freezing environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my question for you is how
important do you see the temperature of
[SPEAKER_03]: the location being and where on that range
do you think that we wanna be both for the
[SPEAKER_03]: home hash maker who's making something for
their head and also somebody who is
[SPEAKER_03]: planning on sharing with their friends,
maybe even at a price?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of variables in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first and foremost is what are you
washing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of material are you washing?
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, if you're gonna wash fresh frozen,
you need a cold room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not every single situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain strains have a more drier resin
like GMO or strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get away with doing that in a
not cold room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're gonna wash freshly frozen
cannabis, to me, you're gonna have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier time in a cold room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by a cold room, I mean under 50
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can keep it under 50, it's gonna be
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colder, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could keep it mid 35s, that's
ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that's not really possible
for everybody such as myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mid July.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just harvested some light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 100 degrees during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My little cold room cannot keep up with
the ambient temperature outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the reason I work and live
seasonally where I am just cultivating all
[SPEAKER_00]: summer long and I wait for the colder
weather to come in November before I start
[SPEAKER_00]: processing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a small room that I wash in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a eight by 10 room with just a
typical window unit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy the biggest window unit you can afford
and I just have a little cool bot on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a $300 control that basically
just tricks the air conditioner into not
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing and it just keeps it running and
cycling below 60 so it'll get your room
[SPEAKER_00]: cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used in all different types of
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut flower industry, hunters use them,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely also get cold rooms
that are affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: $3,500 or so for a walk in that you can
just drop on top of a slab.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's not for some home hash
maker, but I would still encourage you to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to use a cold space, whether it be
your basement, your porch, or you wash in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that many times where sleep
during the day, wash in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that crazy to someone like me,
but to me, if you are washing freshly
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen material, you're going to be
frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be doing it in something
that isn't cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to coat your bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hurt your yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even really greasy material in a cold room
can be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, the wedding cakes and the
ice cream cakes and the stuff that I wash,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff's just so greasy by nature that
even in a 40 degree room, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between a 45 degree room
and a 40 degree room is a difference and
[SPEAKER_00]: then one that's 35, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having everything be cold, cold,
cold, your bags cold, the water cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: your tools cold, everything cold,
it does help with washing fresh frozen for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to wash dried material or
flash dried material, it's not as
[SPEAKER_00]: important in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I've done so many trim runs as a
young kid outside on porches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in controlled rooms at all and it
was never an issue, never an issue at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim run or dried run, I flash dried some
stuff this past year and I washed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flash dried versus I flash dried the
same strain and then I fresh froze it just
[SPEAKER_00]: to wash the two and compare myself just to
see the difference from my own knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It teaches you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest anyone to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just trying to figure it out for
themselves and have some fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the same material, give it a three to
five day dry and then freeze it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just fresh freeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that has a three to five day
dry, it was so easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like washing GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just very easy clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no contaminant in the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You barely have to spray it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't coating your bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not coating your spoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna work with dried stuff,
you don't really need a cold room so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's what makes the decision for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're like, hey, I am in a warm
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a cold situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tell you personally, you should
probably dry your material if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's someone who loves washing fresh
frozen first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a cold room to do it,
man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be a little nervous, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just me personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, no, I got freezers right now
of some stuff that I'm so excited to wash,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not even thinking about it till
come November.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't seem possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: When talking about the final product,
it sounds like the process that you use is
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be dependent on whether or not it is
fresh frozen or dried.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you see in the difference of the
final product though versus fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_03]: and dried?
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing that comes to mind is
probably terpenes, but you've certainly
[SPEAKER_03]: seen a lot of head to head comparisons of
the same cultivar being run both ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you see the differences in the
final product of fresh frozen versus
[SPEAKER_03]: dried?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just talking with a buddy the other
day yesterday and to me, they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's just this weird thing
going on I feel like in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community where people just love to jump
on bandwagons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't necessarily have their own
opinion, but they got someone else's
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion in their pocket who they respect
and they're like, oh, I'm gonna use that
[SPEAKER_00]: person's opinion because I don't know,
then I align with that person or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what it is exactly,
but I feel like there's this whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, indoor is better than outdoor and
then, oh, fresh frozen is better than
[SPEAKER_00]: dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was even on that train too where I was
like, how would dried material make better
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I started to do it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do I trust more than most people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, all right, I am going to
personally start drying material and
[SPEAKER_00]: washing it even though I don't think I
like that, even though I think it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: a waste of my time, I wanna prove to
myself that this is why and I have reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: to stand by and through doing that,
I don't necessarily have a opinion on one
[SPEAKER_00]: being better than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much opinion involved in it
where it's preference in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dried material and fresh frozen material
are different and what's wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with them being different
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like there being other options and stuff
like that, so I just don't feel like we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to say fresh frozen is better and
dried is inferior or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, I try to tell people now they make
different products and you're asking me
[SPEAKER_00]: what is different about them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I find sometimes the dried material,
it will make a drier resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also find sometimes that drier material
will yield slightly more, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially more where you're like,
oh, why are we even washing fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really found that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really washed something dry
versus fresh and been like, the yield was
[SPEAKER_00]: twice dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am only washing dried material from now
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hasn't happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very small yield increases I have noticed
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely different smells, flavors,
aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't sit here and tell you that the
fresh frozen is always louder because it
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't been.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have washed some stuff that was dried
and I was like, Gil, that stuff is louder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got them sitting next to each other
and you can't help but decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll give them to a friend who's very
experienced, smokes a lot of hash and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't tell me which one's frozen and which
one's dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that just shows you that there's a
place for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a place for dried material.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a place for fresh frozen
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see these people who are quick to
knock the man doing the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh frozen is the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screwdried material or screwdried fresh
frozen dries the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, there's room for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough room for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't knock the other man's hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone's stoked to wash fresh
material, you don't know why they're
[SPEAKER_00]: washing fresh material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they don't have a space to dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there was a problem along the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone's stoked on washing fresh
frozen and they're making a great product,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all I care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone's washing dried material,
dry runs and making great product,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all I care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the end result, I just want it to be
quality, first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what really matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just something that's trippy to me that
always interests me when I wash dried
[SPEAKER_00]: material is it always dumps in the larger
micron bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wash something fresh frozen,
it'll yield, let's say, in the 73 and 90
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll wash it dried and it will be
dumping.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 120 and 160, I wonder if the heads
just naturally shrink, pucker up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit from the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once maybe you hit them into that
water, they actually expand is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else could be going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lack a lot of terminology and experience
as far as the science goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the master of neuroscience when it
comes to hash-making and terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to sit here and try to sound
like I'm a lab technician or that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of expertise that I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a lot of knowledge I've gained is
simply through experience and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions I've come to are simply me
just thinking about it and imagining it
[SPEAKER_00]: and coming to it through common sense,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't necessarily know that's
what's happening with the heads,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's what I imagine is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I've seen over and over
again is for some reason the heads are
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger with the dried material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, bigger heads mean better hash
in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not necessarily saying that though in
this regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just something weird where I'll
have this stuff dump in the 190 bag and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's amazing 190.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying when I washed it fresh
frozen, there was absolutely nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: capturable in the 190.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I washed it dry and it was tons of
stuff in the 190.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think that a fresh frozen
trichome head would be bigger than one
[SPEAKER_00]: that you dried and then rehydrated,
but it's something that I've seen with
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just something that I've seen that
I found interesting when I was physically
[SPEAKER_00]: washing the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as having a rule of thumb for the
end results, fresh frozen will always give
[SPEAKER_00]: you this and dry will always give you
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been my personal experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things have surprised me and that's what
keeps me doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being able to keep that surprise in your
craft too probably keeps it fresh instead
[SPEAKER_03]: of getting bored and ever feeling like a
job.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were comparing the indoor versus
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regardless of where we do our growing or
where we do our mechanical separation,
[SPEAKER_03]: we always need to make the plant material
cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: We turn to ice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to hear your insights on the
kinds of ice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you were the first person who I
met who actually cares so much to make his
[SPEAKER_03]: own ice, which I thought was pretty
badass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't until I moved out to the country
that I realized that the water that goes
[SPEAKER_03]: into making the ice matters a lot because
there's a lot of minerals in the water out
[SPEAKER_03]: where I am now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes crappy hash, so I actually can't
use my local water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got different preferences
about size of ice and edges and all this
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you have run a lot of ice.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does your experience tell you and
what are some of your preferences?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not make ice anymore by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time where I fully did do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough respect to all the hash makers who
are making handmade ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to me, it becomes like a job unto
itself of making ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I've got hundreds of ice trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to sit there and pour them and I
would have stand up freezers to fill with
[SPEAKER_00]: the ice trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a job unto itself to just hand
make the ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely made a nice larger cube and we
were able to use the RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, if you're making hash on a small
scale, I'm not discouraging you.
[SPEAKER_00]: By all means, make your ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as practicality, if you're
doing stuff on scale, making ice is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be possible in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to require a ice machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, there's a lot of reverse osmosis
ice machines available out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manitowoc makes them, Oshizaki makes them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be pronouncing both those brands
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oshizaki, they make a large cube ice
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one that if you're in Vegas and
you got a nice glass of whiskey,
[SPEAKER_00]: they give you a large squared cube for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a machine that does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't last very long, I guess,
because of the nature of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The auger and the mechanics can fail is
what they've told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not much more than the
standard unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, if you're going to
splurge on an ice machine, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely go with that larger square cube
than the crescent cube that they typically
[SPEAKER_00]: make.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you're going to want to get an
ice machine with RO water, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I luckily live not far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about an hour from Arcata,
California, which is the hub of all
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hippie and, I don't know, natural and,
you know, build country living and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fortunately, Arcata has the water
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Miss Aya's water store,
Casey down there, supplying all of
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County with the reverse osmosis
ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a couple of ice machines down
there, as well as a very nice water store
[SPEAKER_00]: that can give you great water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she started making ice for the local
hash community, not specifically the local
[SPEAKER_00]: hash community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can imagine, there's a lot of
people up here doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's providing reverse osmosis ice for
the people doing a huge community service,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really awesome of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So believe it or not, man, I drive an hour
and I load up my truck and bring it back
[SPEAKER_00]: to chest freezers at my place because I
have not bought an ice machine yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, something I should invest in
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned earlier in the show,
I'm pretty cheap, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as buying an ice machine,
if you buy an ice machine, to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to keep it running.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to keep it running or you're going
to have to shut it down, take it apart,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean it all, store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of this game of like,
I only work seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it makes sense to just get ice from
her, support a local business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be taking my machine apart and
kind of putting it away for the summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which again, it's not unrealistic,
just wasn't necessarily practical for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I buy reverse osmosis ice from the
store, bring it out to my place,
[SPEAKER_00]: store it in chest freezers and use it as I
need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very practical, maybe for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of friends who make
incredible hash and they get their ice
[SPEAKER_00]: from Costco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bust their balls about it all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to joke about how the food core
down the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too far from the ice machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those foot long Costco hot dogs and those
chicken baked turps are working their way
[SPEAKER_00]: into your ice and eating all their flavor
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, but seriously, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I know a lot of people who
are making gas station ice hash and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, not all gas station ice is
created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to some places and you're just
like, oh God, this is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other places are like,
no, this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would eat out of this cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, cleanliness is first and
foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what your ice situation
is like, melt a bag of it in a five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket, see what floats, see what's in
there, drink some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste like chlorine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Little common sense, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of friends who believe if the
water's really cold and the ice is really
[SPEAKER_00]: cold and everything's really cold,
it's in there so short period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have friends who are using hose
water and gas station ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, me personally, I am using reverse
osmosis water and reverse osmosis ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that just takes out a variable for
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know your water's clean, you know your
herbs clean, you know your ice is clean
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know your equipment's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel pretty good about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So comes down to preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen great hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know great hash makers who are just
using whatever for ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to put it out there that
people think they have to have reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: osmosis, that it's not necessarily the
case at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you live on a mountain and you got
great spring water coming out the mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: and all cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds even better than RO to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, just have clean water source,
clean water, clean ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any insight on the size of the
cubes?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've mentioned preferring large cubes a
few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that just because, is it a personal
preference or do you think that it
[SPEAKER_03]: actually functions better than smaller
cubes or crushed ice?
[SPEAKER_00]: My point for that mainly is I do multiple
washes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the stuff I'm washing requires
three or four washes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A larger cube lasts longer so you need to
use less ice in between washes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just allows you to go through less.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it really is just about cold,
cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The agitation and the rowing or if you're
using machines, that's what's breaking off
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily the ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ice contributing factor to that,
yeah I'm sure it's helping as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, to me it's more about the
vortex of the water that's actually doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the mechanical separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily your ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to use crushed ice,
use crushed ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use big cube ice, I don't
really care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just about being cold,
cold, cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I like a larger cube is to me
it helps just last longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, in between washes while that
stuff's sitting and I'm filtering out,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's on ice still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nice chunky ice, that's how I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have one question about water quality
because we've already talked quite a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: about water quality going into the frozen
ice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But speaking to your frugal self,
there's a lot of folks who are working at
[SPEAKER_03]: home and they live rurally and maybe
they've got mineralized water or maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: they've got kind of sulfury water.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of variability in water as
soon as, well heck, this is even a good
[SPEAKER_03]: question for the city grid because a lot
of city grid water has got fluoride and
[SPEAKER_03]: chlorine in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my question is, is that if we all have
got the best practice of getting RO,
[SPEAKER_03]: but RO is not available to us for whatever
reason, how low do you think the threshold
[SPEAKER_03]: is for chlorine fluoride or these minerals
to actually impart taste to the finished
[SPEAKER_03]: product?
[SPEAKER_03]: If we want to get RO, that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how likely do you think it is that
these lesser than waters are actually
[SPEAKER_03]: going to mess with the final hash product?
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it goes to like a common sense
thing is how I would approach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously not all water sources are
created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back from New England and a lot of my
friends in Vermont, the water that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out the tap is seriously brown and
extremely sulfury.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your tap water is smelling sulfury,
is tainted in color, you're not drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: your tap water, I wouldn't want to be
making hash with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't see how it's going to lend
itself to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do whatever I could to have
cleaner water.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's not a fine line though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, this water smells like
eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not going to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you taste some water in the city and
you're like, oh, tastes slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorinated, I'm saying ever so slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't necessarily be terrified to use
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in a city, your water source
probably isn't that great if you're asking
[SPEAKER_00]: a hippie like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I expect you to go to the store and buy
gallons of spring water to do your hash
[SPEAKER_00]: runs?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're washing in a five gallon bucket,
doesn't seem crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're washing in 20 gallon barrel or
32 gallon barrels, that kind of doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: seem practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me then, if you're doing that on scale,
then you invest in a water filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small home batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I go to cooking analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're cooking at your house and you're
making a birthday cake for your kid and it
[SPEAKER_00]: requires water and your tap water is
brown, are you going to use that or are
[SPEAKER_00]: you going to pour it out of a jug of
water?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to use a jug of
water to make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, just common sense goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your water is terrible, don't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all different kinds of filters out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get really quality filters for 200
bucks and you can get one for $5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what you're trying to
do, what kind of volume of water you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to actually filter off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those things that you just
figure it out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just trying to make a little
hash for yourself at home, make a little
[SPEAKER_00]: hash for yourself at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, you might be like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The water ruined this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely done that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the only way to determine that is
just a little bit of common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour a glass of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drink that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not something you're trying to
drink, I don't know if you really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: soak all your resin in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion and I think it is
an opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have other friends who are like,
hey, if everything's really cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just an extraction thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's getting absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're then putting it in a freeze dryer
and it's sublimating out all the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some people who are probably going
to listen to this and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, to me, not all tap water is
created equal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already talked about material quite
a bit, but at this point, we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: through the process and we're still in the
prepping stage, getting prepared to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually make the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you do as far as breaking down the
flour to be most prepared for the hashing
[SPEAKER_03]: process?
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's all about exposing the surface
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break it all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some chunky stuff, you're going to
have to break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like necessarily cutting into the
actual flour, just chopping up the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that lends itself to making
clean hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, just the way the structure,
the natural structure of the plant allows
[SPEAKER_00]: you to break it down, do it as much as you
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll tell people, keep a nickel
size small.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a big old bud in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's trichomes on the inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for you to get those,
you're going to have to physically break
[SPEAKER_00]: that big old bud up in your barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're using a paddle or you're
using a machine, you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: wash it and wash it until that bud breaks
down and exposes all the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the best thing to do is just do
that when you're prepping the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you don't have to row it as hard or
wash it as hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that resonance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, I spend a lot of time
prepping and I break it all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put my turkey bags in my freezer
with them open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't close them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't compact them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave it open for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that allows the moisture to escape
the bags and to get stuck on the walls of
[SPEAKER_00]: your freezer or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't necessarily create freezer burn
or too much moisture in your bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel like it allows the material to
freeze quicker rather than enclosing it
[SPEAKER_00]: and encapsulating it with a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of almost does the thermophilic
compost reaction where it does throw heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: having all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figure just leave the bags open,
allow it to escape, the moisture to
[SPEAKER_00]: escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also that way, when you open those
bags to dump them into your barrel,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I dump my bags into my barrels,
it's just a bunch of loose little buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not this compressed football of
ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people still using vac
sealers and stuff for their material.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, don't compress your material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not compress it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not pack it in your freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stuff a freezer in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work multiple freezers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the bags and they're all loose,
all open so that when you dump them out
[SPEAKER_00]: ...
[SPEAKER_00]: I just see it as you want everything to be
gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be able to gently roll the
heads off those necks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to be this forced thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might as well just have it where all the
material is exposed and everything can
[SPEAKER_00]: just fall off real easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about agitation now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been so many evolutions in hash
technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: When talking about how actually to add
motion to the ice and the flour to get
[SPEAKER_03]: those resin heads to knock off.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first learned around a decade ago
to make my own hash, we were using the
[SPEAKER_03]: paint mixer on a drill.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was messy, but it was efficient and
it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we started having the advent of these
small camping washing machines.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are running bigger washing machines
too, but essentially a washing machine
[SPEAKER_03]: that moves it around, which is a much more
gentle way than the paint mixers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then some hardcore people have come all
the way around and they're using hand
[SPEAKER_03]: paddles again to be super, super gentle
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that each of those processes are
all being used still today.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you see as the pros and the cons
of some of these more common methods for
[SPEAKER_03]: agitating?
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally hand row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally use paddles and I row by
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, if you work solo or if you just
have a lot of material, a lot of material
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to process, there is a place
for machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person can only do so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the place for machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: My gripe with machines is just the
cleaning of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like you got to clean them
when you're done, clean them before you
[SPEAKER_00]: use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like when you're using
machines or when I've used machines,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm relying on them to run through a lot
of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up not using one machine,
but you end up using like 15 machines,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then your job becomes like,
oh, every day cleaning these machines,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of every day cleaning these
machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a lot of maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, that's not how I enjoy
spending my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if you got a bunch of material
to run, machines will help you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, I like the hand row.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hand row has a physicality to it that
can't be matched with a machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I joke around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you feel that fish on the
end of your rod, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sensitivity with that paddle
that you can achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Material, me personally, I don't have an
SOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, everyone nowadays in
2020, they all want your SOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me how you do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, there isn't really one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approach each wash differently,
and paddling allows me to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can paddle for 15 minutes, and then be
like, look at the result, and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you went too hard, or you know what,
you're gonna need to go harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows me to determine, okay,
you know what, I'm gonna do this in four
[SPEAKER_00]: washes, 10 minutes, 10 minutes each,
and I'm gonna start more gentle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'm gonna go more aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's kind of the approach that I
start with, is I try to make that first
[SPEAKER_00]: wash real delicate, real pure,
and then I ramp up the aggression more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more with each wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like hand rowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it allows me to be like,
go harder or go less.
[SPEAKER_00]: The machines, they just have a timer
setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go one way, and then go the other
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really have an aggressive wash
or a light wash, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, someone would tell you,
well, you just adjust that through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just do a three-minute wash versus a
seven-minute, and I hear that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some material is just denser,
and you have to beat the hell out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some material is light, and you gotta be
gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, as weird as hand doing
anything, being more consistent than a
[SPEAKER_00]: machine doesn't make sense, but for me
personally, it allows me to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent results because I just cater
the way I wash based on the material,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said that when you are using the
paddle, you can get real-time feedback on
[SPEAKER_03]: whether or not you need to go less hard or
go more hard and be more aggressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a sign or a signal that you are
looking for that you have gone too hard
[SPEAKER_03]: and you need to mellow it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just green, contamination in the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pull your bags and there's a bunch
of green in there, you've been beating the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I've made very few, I've made
very little green hash in my life,
[SPEAKER_00]: very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, you gotta really be beating the
hell out of it to make green hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really going crazy, soaking it for crazy
long, beating it for crazy long,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've washed up a fifth time
before, and I've done it knowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, this is the fifth wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it your all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, let's try to get every single head
off this, and let's even try to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to be so thorough that we make,
and it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's literally hard,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, you really gotta abuse the
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've washed with kids, and they do this
special little row that they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got this little posture that they
have, and they just do this repetitive
[SPEAKER_00]: little row, and I can tell they think,
this kid thinks he's fucking rowing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: special way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude thinks he's got a special row
technique, and to me, it's not that deep,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just agitating this stuff,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can do it wrong, but not really,
man, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've rowed those bigger vessels,
Bruteless dropped those large 65-gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: troughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone at one with three other buddies
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just beat the shit out of this stuff
and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just been like, oh, it just dumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, we got it out in two washes instead
of three or four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's kind of hard to, I don't know,
overly beat up the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some people are listening that's
probably thinking I'm crazy, but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never really done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really made green stuff and
just totally have it be terrible,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm often usually washing fresh
frozen, and like I said, I am kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: going gradually, multiple washes.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the washing machines and hand
paddling, both.
[SPEAKER_03]: With experience, anybody can learn what
the appropriate length of time is,
[SPEAKER_03]: but for the vast majority of people who
are making hash, who are making it for
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves, they're never going to really
make enough hash to know exactly when to
[SPEAKER_03]: stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any signs that you look for when
either paddling or using the washing
[SPEAKER_03]: machine that tells you, okay, I have
agitated enough, whatever I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: has already come off, and now I just need
to wait for it to settle in the bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's just yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I look to.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first wash is going to dump.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second wash is going to be about half
what my first is.
[SPEAKER_00]: My third is going to be about half what my
second is, and then I kind of gauge what's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bottom of that third wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled 20 grams out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm going to get 10 more off a
fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get from the first to
second, then that third comes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really not much shit in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of getting darker at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just know that fourth wash is going to
yield very little, and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, though, if you're that home
washer and you only got two pounds to
[SPEAKER_00]: wash, you might be like, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to keep washing this until
there's nothing left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've washed up six times before and just
pulled nothing out and been like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, that was a waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it really was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, okay, now I know I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you know going forward,
oh, I can wash that cultivar five times
[SPEAKER_00]: for this much time, and keeping data is
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, for the hash maker, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not typically that type of person,
but when it comes to hash, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down how much I'm washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down how long I washed it for,
how many washes, and then I'm writing down
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm capturing so that I know my
percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what's dumping in what bag,
and it's something to reflect on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back and look, and you can see
how something washed this year or that
[SPEAKER_00]: year and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the only real way to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one knows looking at material how,
oh, that's going to take 45 minutes of
[SPEAKER_00]: agitation, and it will be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one knows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to do it is to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, there's nothing wrong with washing
material until there's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just wasted some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, if you're
thorough with your sprayer and cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: the material, I've made some crazy
green-looking stuff blonde by just
[SPEAKER_00]: spending the time cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaning it, cleaning it, spraying it,
cleaning it, spraying it, cleaning it,
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be scared to make green hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, you might be able to clean it up,
but B, worse comes to worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made some green hash, and I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something you can do with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make edibles out of it, roll it up,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather know you extracted it all than
just know it's in the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guilty of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some days, I'll wash all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to the end of the day,
and you're like, do I want to do a fourth
[SPEAKER_00]: wash on this shit right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've already washed 15 barrels today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do a fourth wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm throwing 40 grams of hash in my
compost pile right now, but I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sounds crazy, but it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the part of hash making that I like the
least is draining the bags, because the
[SPEAKER_03]: bags are filled with water, and you're
lifting them up to create the opportunity
[SPEAKER_03]: for gravity to pull the water through the
bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's heavy, and it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first few runs, you're all
enthusiastic, and you're feeling robust,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're doing a lot over the course
of the day, by after lunch, you're feeling
[SPEAKER_03]: sluggish from eating, and you're like,
this starts to suck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people start to cut corners,
which is dangerous at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any insights or tricks about
essentially lifting the bags up so that
[SPEAKER_03]: the water can drain through most
efficiently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, this is a serious problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely been there many a times
where I'm just by myself, end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: just defeated, body just exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got a 45U bag that just will not
drain, and it's got 20 gallons of water in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and it's just 100 pounds,
and you can't even lift it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just the nature of a resin,
working with fresh frozen material,
[SPEAKER_00]: time is of the essence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the longer that that bag sits,
the longer the resin coats it and makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: harder to drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So personally, the thing that I found the
best is I use 20-gallon bags, and I use
[SPEAKER_00]: 20-gallon trash barrels, little smaller
20-gallon brute trash barrels to put those
[SPEAKER_00]: in for the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use a conical drill bit,
and I drill holes in the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: 20-gallon brute trash barrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use as many of those as you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have gone as far as I have a barrel for
literally every bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 45U bag has its own barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 73U bag has its own barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 90U bag has its own barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just stack them in each other like
you normally would with the bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you have them in its own barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, you can grab that barrel by
the handles, and you can really give it
[SPEAKER_00]: hell, force it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you basically got to do is you
got to break the seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash is naturally, through gravity,
being forced on the bottom of that screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's sealing it, making it hard to
drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can grab that barrel and pop it
up, pop it up and force that pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: that suction that's starting to break,
that will get that thing going again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it takes multiple pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to really give it hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you grab that barrel, and you just
keep lifting it and dropping it,
[SPEAKER_00]: lifting it and dropping it, and lifting it
and dropping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just do that over and over
again, that bag will drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it seems like it just will not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just keep lifting it and popping it,
keep lifting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when it helps if you have a
drain on your floor or something large to
[SPEAKER_00]: drain in, and you can really just take
that barrel and just put it on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you got to do, then that's
what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, to me, it helps to have those
Bruteless with holes drilled in the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of them for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you could just use one and put
all the bags in that one and then put that
[SPEAKER_00]: in another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen many people's different setups
to where they put a small trash barrel on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of another trash barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see different people's pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's all this different tech to
just elevate that bag so that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: really having to do much lifting yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that just letting it sit there
is kind of not the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just fill it up to the brunt,
trim and keep adding water and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly, slowly more draining.
[SPEAKER_00]: The move is to not just sit there and look
at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be proactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're just hitting the side of
the barrel just over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people use weird machines to
vibrate the barrel and to hit the barrel
[SPEAKER_00]: and different things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just agitation, anything that you can
keep it moving so that that water goes
[SPEAKER_00]: through is what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see a super cut of all of the
crazy ideas people have come up with to
[SPEAKER_03]: agitate the bag while it's draining to try
to open up the micron filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you there's some crazy ass
inventions that people have used that have
[SPEAKER_03]: both worked, not worked and worked but
been a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be really interesting to kind of see
them all lined up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this brings us to the part where,
okay, so we've got our hash bag and the
[SPEAKER_03]: water is drained out and our glorious
reservoir is there sitting in the bottom
[SPEAKER_03]: in the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I've only ever heard of or I've only
ever experienced and worked one way to get
[SPEAKER_03]: the hash out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was taught that I put a frisbee,
open side of the frisbee pointed up and I
[SPEAKER_03]: stretch my micron screen over the frisbee
and then I gently scrape along that with a
[SPEAKER_03]: sharp knife and gently remove the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't made hash with a lot of other
people though.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm guessing that a frisbee and a
sharp knife is probably not industry
[SPEAKER_03]: standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: What techniques do you like for removing
hash from that delicate micron screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is when the game kind of changed
due to freeze dryers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it used to be kind of a harder
process when you had to gather the resin
[SPEAKER_00]: out the bags and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, thankfully due to the freeze dryers,
it's not this technical thing anymore in
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want it to be wet when you put
it in your freeze dry trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wetter the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows the water to actually
sublimate out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people trying to dry their
patties and that is not the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the water in order for the water
to be able to escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how sublimation works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're now pouring this very
liquidy stuff into trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much easier in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just scooping it out as quickly as
possible, pouring it in the trays and
[SPEAKER_00]: loading it into the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I love freeze dryers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people who are still hand
drying hash, air drying hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I wash, I'm usually doing production
and the freeze dryer allows that to be
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air drying to me is an art unto itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a different thing that I personally
have have moved away from and I am not
[SPEAKER_00]: looking back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not looking back to continue
microplaning, continue air drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I have freeze dryers personally,
it changed everything for me for the
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have yet to use an air dryer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly have shopped them and have
enjoyed the quality of sandy blonde hash
[SPEAKER_03]: that comes out of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that description that you gave of that
hashy slurry that you're just able to pour
[SPEAKER_03]: right out of the bag into the tray.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, that sounds really convenient and
efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just made me realize, God,
I really need to reconsider getting a
[SPEAKER_03]: dryer like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the folks who are not going to be
doing that, folks like most of us who are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be air drying, once you have the
micron screen taught, over something like
[SPEAKER_03]: a frisbee and you are removing it as much
as you can from the screen, what do you
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend that people put that hash on to
start the process of air drying?
[SPEAKER_03]: The classic is the pizza box.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, it's totally funny
that the pizza place here on the island
[SPEAKER_03]: where I live on Vashon Island,
they are so used to people coming in and
[SPEAKER_03]: just buying pizza boxes for hash because
there's so much cannabis produced
[SPEAKER_03]: historically on my island that the pizza
place knows what they're going to be used
[SPEAKER_03]: for and everybody gets a chuckle out of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people have been using pizza boxes for
a long time and I suspect there are much
[SPEAKER_03]: better options to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you recommend to folks if
they're not going to go the freeze dryer
[SPEAKER_03]: way?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, again, this is just something that I
don't want to necessarily dive down
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's been literally probably two
years since I air dried hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really not my focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what I'm into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say, though, the last times I
did do it, I totally used pizza boxes like
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would freeze the patties, take them out,
freeze the patties and then micro plane
[SPEAKER_00]: them onto cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it was never perfect,
wasn't ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I've moved away from it
personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things that I know that
micro planing is kind of standard for
[SPEAKER_03]: non-commercial production.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always had the idea, though,
that I don't particularly like micro
[SPEAKER_03]: planing because if I am using the micro
plane and I am rupturing the trichomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is releasing the oil to become in
contact with air.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure, my hash is going to get oxidized
anyway if I'm going to be air drying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also creating an opportunity for
the terpenes that are within the resin to
[SPEAKER_03]: touch the air and to just simply go away,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so easily volatilized that I
suspect I'm losing terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a fair concern when micro planing
or am I aware of a concern that really
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't play out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that goes back to me to common
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How could grinding a glandular trichome
head across a sharp metal surface not
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially rupture multiple?
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why to me personally,
I feel that micro planing is inferior to
[SPEAKER_00]: the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel air drying is inferior to the
freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how I personally feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends think air drying is the way
it makes a superior product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never experienced that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not once in my life have I ever seen air
dried stuff next to a freeze dryer and
[SPEAKER_00]: been like, oh, that's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand someone sitting at home
doesn't necessarily have access to a
[SPEAKER_00]: freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just going to have to dry it any
way you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breaking it down exposes the surface area
and allows it to dry quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why people micro plane is simply
because it breaks it all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people use credit cards,
knives, just push it through a sieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many ways you can go about
breaking it down further if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be, in my opinion,
about trial and error and seeing which one
[SPEAKER_00]: works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to promote freeze dryers so hard to
the home person, but just to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really was a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely an investment nonetheless,
but if you're making enough hash to fill a
[SPEAKER_00]: freeze dryer, then to me, it's a
no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pays for itself really quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those economies of scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to be producing enough to
fill that dryer, it'll pay for itself the
[SPEAKER_03]: first time you use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be inclusive of all of the home folks,
pushing through a sieve and then removing
[SPEAKER_03]: the water just simply with evaporation is
still incredibly common.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that you don't practice this
anymore, but I'm going to take one more
[SPEAKER_03]: step down this path because there's a lot
of people who are listening who,
[SPEAKER_03]: like me, this is what we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the process that we're going to
use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once the hash material is pushed through a
strainer or a sieve, which helps break it
[SPEAKER_03]: up on the pizza box, perhaps a pizza box
covered with parchment, I see there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of different versions of people maybe
putting the pizza boxes in a tent or
[SPEAKER_03]: putting them in front of a box fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people who've got a nice enclosed
area, they'll put in a box fan for
[SPEAKER_03]: rotation and potentially an air
conditioner to keep it cool and then
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially a dehumidifier to help remove
the water as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can reach back two years into your
experience, was there a particular setup
[SPEAKER_03]: that you liked when you actually did air
dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like doing it in the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's all about doing it in the
cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pretty much dry hash in a regular
freezer almost all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, cold is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not warm, but cold, as cold as you
possibly can get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a really interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had not even considered that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same process that eventually
freezer burns food, but if you're only
[SPEAKER_03]: using it for a few days, the nature of the
freezer is dehydrating and putting it in a
[SPEAKER_03]: freezer, you will not only keep it cold
and keep those turps from volatilizing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you are evaporating out the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you just upgraded my game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be doing that next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's lots of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, please reach out to someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out to Kush Kirk, Brandon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves air drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's real passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be vague and suddenly
shut down when it came to where the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation switched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't like to talk on stuff that
I'm not super familiar with, not actively
[SPEAKER_00]: doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to sound naive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm sorry to be vague about
hand drying or air drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't been doing it a lot
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk on it too much,
but like I said, Brandon does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people out there that are
doing it still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply Adam, he's one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, by all means, you're trying to air
dry, hand dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it with dehumbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it with heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it with cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the way is cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last thing before we wrap up,
before we go to our second commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: break is kind of like a systemic strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've used the idea of cooking and
recipes several times.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this idea in French cooking of
mise en place, which is you cut all your
[SPEAKER_03]: ingredients and you get all your stuff out
and on the counter before you start so
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're not like, oh, where the hell
did I put the whatever when you're in the
[SPEAKER_03]: process of cooking the meal?
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect that we've not talked about
this, that you are probably a person who
[SPEAKER_03]: is maybe not now since you are so
experienced, but writing a list of what
[SPEAKER_03]: your process is and making sure that you
have everything out in advance is probably
[SPEAKER_03]: a good idea, especially for folks that are
trying to teach themselves how to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The less pressure or the more time you can
buy for yourself as you're actually in the
[SPEAKER_03]: moment making the hash is probably the
best thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you recommend for people as far as
you got all your materials?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you recommend for people for a
smart, efficient setup?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't need much.
[SPEAKER_00]: My room is probably about eight by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely have a sink in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help to have the deep sink
so you can rinse your bags as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible as soon as you pull them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important with fresh frozen
materials, you know, cleaning them almost
[SPEAKER_00]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a sink with water is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have a large reservoir there
that's there that holds all the water that
[SPEAKER_00]: I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some places, labs I work,
they have, you know, enough water that's
[SPEAKER_00]: on demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have a large reservoir that I
can ice down personally, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I can physically be
dropping ice into so that my water source
[SPEAKER_00]: is nice and cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to have a reservoir that,
you know, has enough water for the day and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I can continually drop ice into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to have a small freezer
in my workspace so that I can have my
[SPEAKER_00]: material in there and it's going straight
from the freezer into the bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and also have enough ice on
demand in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the ice machine present,
so it's nice to have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, personally, I have my freeze
dryer in my cold room so that it's right
[SPEAKER_00]: there so that I am, you know, my freeze
dryer is on and running so it is all cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trays are cold so that when I am
putting it into there, it is going from
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, the cold room into that
negative 40 almost instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It freezes in minutes, you know,
so it's nice to have the freeze dryer in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cold room right next to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a perfect world, you would have a drain
in your floor, you know, obviously that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not ideal, but working outside takes care
of that situation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to have an assortment of
different size spoons on here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just small, medium, large
spoons, have them on a nice metal tray so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're all nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps to have, you know, some hand
sprayers, little pump sprayers filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol, you know, just so you can keep
cleaning your utensils, clean your bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to have a sprayer so that you
can spray the hash, whether you're using a
[SPEAKER_00]: hand pump sprayer from Chapin,
use that for years that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people now are using
those like nine gallon flow zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, battery operated pumps to spray
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people, labs, I'm seeing people are,
you know, basically getting these things
[SPEAKER_00]: installed so that they have water pumps
with little sprayers at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that because then you can kind of
have a reservoir for your hand sprayer so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can ice down that real nice and have
as much water as you need and not have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be pumping all day long, possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously just an assortment of
barrels, barrels to row in, barrels for
[SPEAKER_00]: your bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to have extra barrels
just to like throw bags in while you work
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like that's pretty much
everything that's in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's not really much in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of just an open space so that
you got room to work in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to talk about storage next,
but let's do that after the commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: break.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is hash maker, Ganja Gill,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Ice Wook.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you listen to Shaping Fire and you grow
your own cannabis, chances are high that
[SPEAKER_03]: you are very particular about the inputs
you use for growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: People like us painstakingly self-educate
on cannabis nutrients and techniques so we
[SPEAKER_03]: can cultivate the best tasting and
cleanest flowers possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we go to purchase those
nutrients, we want to be sure that our
[SPEAKER_03]: supplier shares our values and is
providing exceptional quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I recommend buildasoil.com to
my friends who care about quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Build A Soil empowers organic growers to
do their best work by sourcing and
[SPEAKER_03]: shipping only the finest cannabis growing
supplies.
[SPEAKER_03]: From organic inputs, soils, soil testing,

[SPEAKER_03]: Quality organic growing supplies at
buildasoil.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: While I love growing under the sun,
there's a lot of good reasons to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're like most folks,
you want a lighting source that grows high
[SPEAKER_03]: yielding, healthy plants without using
excessive amounts of electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: BIOS lighting creates biological lighting
solutions that brings the natural
[SPEAKER_03]: brilliance of the outdoors into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: BIOS lighting has the attributes that I
look for in a horticultural lighting
[SPEAKER_03]: solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've bought those cheap lights online and
they're difficult to work with and fail in
[SPEAKER_03]: no time.
[SPEAKER_03]: In contrast, my BIOS LED light is
industrial grade to last a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is IP 66 wet rated, so little foliar
overspray won't harm it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is easy to clean without taking it
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the most important aspect,
it is built for the exact light spectrum I
[SPEAKER_03]: want for great yielding, healthy cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't hurt that their lighting
rigs look bad ass too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many horticultural LED lighting systems
are based on irrelevant performance
[SPEAKER_03]: metrics and people love to argue online
about these numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer to judge on power photon
efficiency and how happy my plants are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the BIOS lights exceed my expectations
in these categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: BIOS lights have an optimized broad
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_03]: plant growth while also providing the
ideal conditions for superior power
[SPEAKER_03]: efficacy and a comfortable visual
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also love their attentive and
overeducated customer service folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: BIOS starts with a team of biologists
before getting the electrical engineers
[SPEAKER_03]: involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have studied how light impacts
cannabis plants and devised an overall
[SPEAKER_03]: strategy that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: I encourage you to check out their website
at bioslighting.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_03]: how this strategy can work for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Shaping Fire listeners can get a

[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know that Shaping Fire has a
fabulous YouTube channel with content not
[SPEAKER_03]: found on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_03]: When I attend conventions or speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_03]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Kevin
[SPEAKER_03]: Joudry of Wonderland Nursery, talking
about breeding cannabis for the best
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicholas Mahmood on regenerative and
polyculture cannabis growing.

cannabis medicine around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben Cassidy of True Terpenes on using
terpenes for health in your everyday life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reggie Gaudino of Steep Hill on the
cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jeff Lowenfels on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even my own presentation on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_03]: high.
[SPEAKER_03]: As of today, there are over 100 videos

[SPEAKER_03]: free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to youtube.com forward slash Shango Los
or click on the link in this week's
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is hash maker Ganja Gill,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Ice Wook.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this point, we have got ourselves
some hash made and it is ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my question for you, Gill,
is curing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people believe that
some special magic happens from the
[SPEAKER_03]: interplay of the terpenes and the other
subtle, you know, organic compounds that
[SPEAKER_03]: are in the hash that make it something
more than simply a trichome that's been
[SPEAKER_03]: removed from the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts on curing to
capture any of that increase in quality
[SPEAKER_03]: from just time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, curing is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, curing, you know, I feel like,
you know, with flour, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially letting the flour marinate in
its own aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is with a resin,
you know, it's tough because you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm typically washing fresh
frozen resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it comes out, I want to keep
it cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this process of continuing to keep
it cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would call, you know,
fresh resin, I don't know if it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: curing all that much in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, me personally, my melt,
I have to keep it in my freezer or
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise it'll freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my freezer, is it really curing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really sure it is, you know,
that's, that's where I stand with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The melt, I'm not sure if it's really
doing much while in that freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have freezer, I have melt in
my freezer from two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's much different today
than it was two years prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, the curing process really comes
into play with rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, me personally, I'm not so much
into the traditional hashies, the temple
[SPEAKER_00]: balling and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pucks, that's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my full melt at freezer
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pixie dust, beach sand, whatever you want
to call it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me personally, it's staying in the
freezer and I don't think my hash is
[SPEAKER_00]: really curing too much in there,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then take the hash and I turn it into
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is definitely a very big
difference between freshly pressed rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: and cured rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is absolutely a difference into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and to me, it goes back to they're
just two very different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not willing to call one superior to
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy fresh pressed rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also enjoyed cured rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of, again, to me, they're just
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to curing the rosin,
you know, most people these days are
[SPEAKER_00]: calling it a cold cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those funny things about the
industry where no one is curing it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cold, sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cold cure rosin, it's going to
actually give you a real dry texture,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the opposite of what people are
trying to achieve through the curing
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people want that wet batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the way you get that wet batter
is by letting your rosin sit, in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 degrees or higher, 70 to 90 is kind of
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start pushing the temperatures,
I start to call it more like a jam tech or
[SPEAKER_00]: jar tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start crashing stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me personally, I am never heating post
press.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just press it and then let it sit at
room temperature, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Trinity County, so it is very
hot in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a pantry that gets a little
warmer than my house that's air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm personally putting my jars in that
room that's slightly warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just takes several days, depending on
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through the marbling process and
then ends up being one tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you essentially just stir it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You whip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You press it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You compact it and give yourself that wet
batter texture, which people like to refer
[SPEAKER_00]: to as cold cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are then not getting a wet
enough consistency for their liking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they're putting it in an oven at
200 degrees and heating it to give it that
[SPEAKER_00]: more wet, sweaty texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, personally, that goes against my
beliefs and what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seriously just trying to do it with,
like I said, room temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the idea of reheating it after the
fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, that sounds like that'd be
terrible for volatilizing all those turps
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've gone through so much effort at
this point to be able to preserve.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like giving them all back there at
the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that is remarkable or
worth remark from the curing that you just
[SPEAKER_03]: described, unlike when we're making temple
balls or pressed hashish bricks or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that, that is often so the
hashish components can intermix and evolve
[SPEAKER_03]: their flavor together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like the curing process you're
describing is not so much for the
[SPEAKER_03]: evolution of the taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like it's more about getting the
hash rosin to a uniform consistency and
[SPEAKER_03]: stability so that it stays the way you
want it to be over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that an agreeable understanding of what
you're suggesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way of looking at it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely about texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The art of hashish is a deep complex
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of traditional hashish
methods that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aging and the whatnot that you're
talking about, that is very valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many people doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not necessarily what I am
currently focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: From watching fresh frozen material,
we are focused on turp preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to preserve those turpines at
all costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're freezing the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're washing it cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're freeze drying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, letting hash sit at room
temperature simply degrades turpines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a fact to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will tell you the ones that
stick out and the ones that last are what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Frenchy Canole told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes the stuff to sit out and age and
the turpines that are able to still stay,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that don't dissipate,
that's what's interesting to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really enjoys the aging of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, me and what a lot of people
are doing in California right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not what we care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to preserve those things
that just evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to hold on to those things
that just eventually aren't there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to preserve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washing fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the freeze dryer is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, I don't care about having
10-year-old hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to have stuff in 20 years
and open it up and be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't appeal to me personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I smoked some really old hash before
that was really enjoyable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like stuff has shifted in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying what we're doing now is
better than this ancient stuff that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just see it as an evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just see it as it's come to this now and
it's going to continue to change to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, I don't see the freeze
dryer leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see it being a phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, they're here to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, with the freeze dryer, it's really
about preserving those turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about working with fresh
frozen material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, yeah, you don't need one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just air dry your hash and then leave it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make bricks of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make temple balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to me, it's a different pursuit than
working with fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely been a bifurcation of
the scene where part of it, generally
[SPEAKER_03]: people who don't have access to the freeze
dryers are still temple balling it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one of those people and I really like
how temple balls evolve taste-wise over
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly don't leave them at room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in a cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when I go over to my buddy's
place who's got a freeze dryer and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: having his beautiful sandy stuff,
I'm like, damn, this is really freaking
[SPEAKER_03]: good too in a different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Than the temple balls that I have in my
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love adding colors to this palette of
our relationship with hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good to have lots of
different products for us all to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to enjoy what we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your comment about you're not really
concerned about having your hash be 10 or
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 years vintage down the line,
but we do all need to store our hash,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially folks who work like you do
where you are seasonal, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to grow your plants during the
summer and wash them during the winter and
[SPEAKER_03]: then store it in a way that it's going to
be good both for your head stash,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then also for providing for friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you store your hash material?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give you two different
threshold points.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say the first threshold point is
stuff that you're going to smooth the
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke within the next two weeks,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like your carry around jar or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you've got stuff that's going to
be in the freezer that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping at that perfect consistency
further than two weeks out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell us a little bit about how you
handle your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, to me, what I really love about my
process is I just freeze all the melt out
[SPEAKER_00]: of my freeze dryer instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to put it in jars, but as people
know, glass condensates when it comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got hash in a glass jar and
it's in your fridge or even freezer and
[SPEAKER_00]: you bring it into room temperature,
do not open that jar right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure most people on your show listen
and know this, but for the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't, you don't open your jar right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let it come to room temperature and
you kind of wipe the sweat off it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the condensate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the hash to absorb that
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the whole idea of using a freeze
dryer and drying hash properly is to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you don't want to be reintroducing
it every time you're pulling your jar out
[SPEAKER_00]: your fridge or freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, me personally, I stopped using
jars to store my melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put it in parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a brand out there, it's called If
You Care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a parchment sandwich bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're these like, you know, sandwich
size parchment bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally me, I fill those up with melt
and then I put them in Ziploc freezer bags
[SPEAKER_00]: and I put them in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows me to store a lot more hash in
a small space than having just a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: random jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also then when I want it, it's easier for
me to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly keep all my melt in my freezer
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Times if I want to smoke it, I pull it out
and personally just drop it on some
[SPEAKER_00]: parchment paper and I press up a little
bit with my fingers to start smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it stays in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you pull that little bit
out to enjoy, you know, sometimes I
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly always just keep it in my
freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even pull it out into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they let it allow it to get room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you're just really quick
with it, you know, there's not enough time
[SPEAKER_00]: for moisture to really get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I am keeping the melt in there
at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I love about that is I have melt
in there from two years ago that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same as the day as when I put
it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is white sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now I'm able to make fresh
pressed rosin and at my leisure,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, suddenly someone wants some
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pull it out the freezer and I load
it into my little bags and make my rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have my fresh pressed rosin to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fresh pressed rosin should be stored
in a wine cooler, 40 degrees ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will keep that fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should keep most rosins stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, or sorry, most rosin that is stable
will be fine in a wine cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stuff that's a little less stable,
you may want to freeze it just to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: totally the same for long, long storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, in my opinion, rosin is
fine in a refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Melt in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you cold cure the rosin at
room temperature, I then like to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it's just stuff that I'm
smoking and enjoying over the next couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of weeks, it's totally fine to just keep
your cold cured rosin on your coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to keep it in the fridge by
any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of the cold cure
texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will stay as that texture the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you have that fresh pressed
rosin on your coffee table, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start to go through the changes,
which is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like about fresh pressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I serve a lot of fresh
pressed is because I like to provide that
[SPEAKER_00]: experience where people can actually watch
the texture change for them and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of make any consistency that they
enjoy with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I think this brings us to
our end there, Gil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for, you know,
A, spending this much time with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've been trying to put together
this interview for a few months,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, it's the summer busy season
for all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for making the time for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then also thank you for sharing your
vast experience on this topic because,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, as you said at the top of the
show, making quality hash is about
[SPEAKER_03]: addressing as many of these little
variables as we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we continue to address more of
these variables, it just continually ups
[SPEAKER_03]: the game of our hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as, you know, hash becomes a new
American pastime, as more home growers
[SPEAKER_03]: come into the scene, these best practices
that you've developed will trickle
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you so much for your time and
I've enjoyed our chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really, really appreciate you
being so persistent and making this
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope it helps people who are
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope your vision of an America
where everyone's making small batch
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates at their home happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that's where cannabis evolves to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope legalization and
normalization really just leads to
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone growing their own cannabis in
their yard for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need much room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a few plants goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That relationship that you'll have with
the plant will be therapeutic unto itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my vision for future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not this crazy wreck world
of all these corporations rolling in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to see just everyone growing
cannabis in their yard, sharing it with
[SPEAKER_00]: their neighbors, sharing it with their
friends, and healing themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to follow along on ganja
gill, the ice wooks adventures,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can follow him best on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's actually got two different
Instagram feeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll find that the kind of content that
he posts at either one are kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: different, but you'll probably want to
follow them both.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the first Instagram is at the real
ice wook, the real ice wook on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you're going to see a lot
of hash photos and hash, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: preparation photos there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then his second Instagram is a little
bit more personal, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's at ganja underscore gill
underscore, and gill is G I L.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's ganja underscore gill underscore.
