[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there friends shango here from shaping
fire with part two of the Segre
[SPEAKER_00]: international Cannabis breeding panel that
I went and asked them for after seeing it
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched it as a web streaming thing and
I and it was so good that I reached out to
[SPEAKER_00]: him I said hey Can I can I have this for
the shaping fire audience because they'd
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see it as well and they're like
sure we'd be honored That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you missed part one,
I recommend that you check that out They
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of nice to watch in order because
it gives you more of a historical timeline
[SPEAKER_00]: But really you don't have to if you don't
want to go click to the other one just
[SPEAKER_00]: watch this one It's guy talks about
different topics and is also really great
[SPEAKER_00]: So the official title for it is the past
the present and the future of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding part two and The panelists are
mostly the same same top-notch premium
[SPEAKER_00]: folks in Ryan Lee that most of us know as
the breeder chimera Rob Clark who's the
[SPEAKER_00]: godfather of cannabis taxonomy and botany
Mark Lewis of Napro research Whose
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars keep on winning Emerald Cup
Awards and then Mojave Richmond from bio
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomics group who's new to me But adds
a lot of real good value to this panel and
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these folks are just really
top-notch and hard to like get you know so
[SPEAKER_00]: the Topics on both have all been cannabis
breeding But specifically what we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about in or what they're gonna talk
about in this episode is modern breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: technology modern breeding innovations
like auto flowers and polyploidy and then
[SPEAKER_00]: what the Contemporary competitive
landscape is right now in in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all great stuff I hope you enjoy
it and here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Our panel today again for part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a great group of guys here to
chat with you today We have Michael
[SPEAKER_01]: Williamson for Catalyst BC and also allele
genetics We have Ryan Lee with us from
[SPEAKER_01]: Keem of our corporation Rob Clark and
Mojave Both from bio agronomic group and
[SPEAKER_01]: then Mark Lewis joining us from Napro
research and the biotech Institute And I
[SPEAKER_01]: think we've got some good geography
covered today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Michael in Florida Ryan in BC
Rob in Sweden and then Mark and Mojave and
[SPEAKER_01]: myself down here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Alright, so with that I'm gonna turn it
over to Michael and he's gonna take this
[SPEAKER_01]: away for us All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good afternoon or good morning or good
evening wherever you may be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining us Let's jump into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So The first question that we're gonna be
tackling today is how will cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding objectives evolve as the industry
matures?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're interested in kind of
exploring Concepts around trait
[SPEAKER_05]: optimization as well as things like
pathogen resistance Mark you want to kick
[SPEAKER_05]: us off there
[SPEAKER_05]: or Ryan
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that, I guess to know where
we're going we kind of need to know where
[SPEAKER_04]: we've been and be really cool if we could
just take like two minutes and have Rob
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of talk about what they used to trait
optimize for in these landrace Varieties
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we can kind of spring off from
there and talk about what we're optimizing
[SPEAKER_02]: for now Well, I think from the point of
view of traditional farmers who develop
[SPEAKER_02]: landraces landraces being Geographically
limited and culturally limited varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: of plants and animals for that matter that
were Evolved Within a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental context and within a certain
cultural context.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was the physical environment the
weather where plants lived every year and
[SPEAKER_02]: Combined with what the farmers wanted from
those plants So basically what landraces
[SPEAKER_02]: were were survivors There was nobody out
there looking for a particular trait It
[SPEAKER_02]: was a balance it was an Evolutionary
balance that manifested itself every year
[SPEAKER_02]: through the planting of seeds that were
sexually reproduced from a male and a
[SPEAKER_02]: female plant in the case of cannabis and
those So so there wasn't the Searching for
[SPEAKER_02]: traits like we do now it was an ecological
balance that came between a farmer and the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment and the interest that Cultures
had in those local plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we changed everything immensely But
those are the building blocks we started
[SPEAKER_02]: with and that's where we'll go on from
today Yeah, I think that that's good,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you think about grain size in the hemp
plant that they're being grown for seed
[SPEAKER_04]: you You know every year you pick that
plant that had the biggest seed and you
[SPEAKER_04]: sprout that biggest seed so that you know
You're optimizing that that fruit size
[SPEAKER_04]: trait And then you have in corn,
it's drought tolerance, of course And and
[SPEAKER_04]: nowadays in cannabis, it's you know,
you either got the fiber which you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want branching they you know lawn stalks
the big seed for your Grain crop and then
[SPEAKER_04]: the big focus now is chemical
optimization.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got hemp trying to reduce the amount
of THC below federal guidelines while
[SPEAKER_04]: creating metabolite concentrations of
other cannabinoids in the you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: high 18s and 20s so you can efficiently
extract a large amount of Metabolite to be
[SPEAKER_04]: used as a therapeutic somehow The next
iteration of this I'm sure will get more
[SPEAKER_04]: specific for different processes and
methods of extraction ie Water hash or
[SPEAKER_04]: sieve filtration be by trichome head size
color Mojave, you know, you you always
[SPEAKER_04]: talk about purple flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know any any good examples Of someone
optimizing that purple trait Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: well purple is purple is a highly
marketable trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Would just add that you know in that
land race selection period of finding
[SPEAKER_03]: those survivors that there was a lot of
because everything was so isolated there
[SPEAKER_03]: was Not necessarily a selection towards a
chemical profile, but there were certain
[SPEAKER_03]: chemical profiles that survived and All
throughout the world in those isolated
[SPEAKER_03]: regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a lot of diversity In the various
compounds that the plant was producing So
[SPEAKER_03]: that's you know in as we move forward we
have to kind of look back to the past
[SPEAKER_03]: before this hybridization event that
happened over the past, you know 30 40 50
[SPEAKER_03]: years and start to explore how those
chemical profiles those chemovars were
[SPEAKER_03]: were established within those land races
and how they Facilitated certain needs for
[SPEAKER_03]: that particular population that region
those various traits That were kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: isolated But yeah purple purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean my thing with purple isn't so much,
you know, I'm It's just that it's funny
[SPEAKER_03]: that color has become such a powerful
marketing tool, especially here on the
[SPEAKER_03]: west coast That kind of goes beyond the
effect of the plant It's just it's such a
[SPEAKER_03]: powerful tool color and smell
[SPEAKER_04]: Path is a pathogen resistant to probably
be Obviously the next attack For trade
[SPEAKER_04]: optimization.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Ian likes to talk about that a lot
He's got anything on them Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean the way I look at it from a plant
breeding perspective is it like any trait
[SPEAKER_06]: Exists on a continuum.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I said I think I said it on the
last one But you know, you can have small
[SPEAKER_06]: plants or tall plants or low yielding
plants or high yielding plants or same
[SPEAKER_06]: with cannabinoid and terpene content can
have low expressors and high expressors,
[SPEAKER_06]: so When you when you look at any trait,
there's this continuum of performance That
[SPEAKER_06]: we see and in cannabis Especially like I
think even much more than a lot of other
[SPEAKER_06]: plants because of the way that it
naturally evolved It has all this built-in
[SPEAKER_06]: variation That we can you know we can take
advantage of as plant breeders
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, one of the things that we
did over the last kind of 20 years is just
[SPEAKER_06]: reshuffled all these different Decks from
all over the world and intermixed them and
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of ended up with like, you know this
big colorful mess of of genes which in
[SPEAKER_06]: some instances has been good, but It
really hasn't allowed us to like Mark said
[SPEAKER_06]: and optimize some of these traits or like,
you know push the most of Any given trait
[SPEAKER_06]: that we can see or even in some cases
create, you know It's called transgressive
[SPEAKER_06]: segregants like plants that are even
farther out than you know, the limits that
[SPEAKER_06]: we've seen before In terms of you know,
any trait yield and smell or whatever And
[SPEAKER_06]: so yeah, you know there there's a lot that
we can do This
[SPEAKER_06]: plant but we definitely have to create
more in red lines and and you know get
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the kinks that we've created and
into reproduction plants Things like root
[SPEAKER_06]: architecture or root chemical performance
or or you know plant architecture like
[SPEAKER_06]: mark was talking about before All these
things add up when you're in a production
[SPEAKER_06]: environment I mean like Rob was saying
you're growing these things the far the
[SPEAKER_06]: least plants came from Farms that were
grown from indigenous or like most of the
[SPEAKER_06]: wild farmers are up in the mountains They
weren't being you know produced in the way
[SPEAKER_06]: that we grow them either in indoors or in
in greenhouses from clone And so we have a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of work that we can do in terms of
plant architecture and Structure in terms
[SPEAKER_06]: of just making the plants easier to grow
and harvest and process And right how far
[SPEAKER_05]: out do you think we are from like I was
referred to as like the utopian plant It
[SPEAKER_05]: seems like you know people come across
cultivars all the time that have one two,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe three really desirable traits You
know, and they kind of refer that as like
[SPEAKER_05]: it checks this box It checks that box but
in terms of like maturation time It seems
[SPEAKER_05]: like there's always like if it's a fast
flowering cultivar I notice like it
[SPEAKER_05]: generally sacrifices yield on the back end
or something it or it Slower and veg for
[SPEAKER_05]: some reason, but I guess how far out do
you think we are from having?
[SPEAKER_05]: through without any kind of gene editing
more of a Utopian plant that kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: checks literally all the boxes and let's
say there's you know, seven of them Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay I only use it look at it I'm gonna
answer you in a way that has nothing to do
[SPEAKER_06]: with what you said It's like imagine
you're like you're coming into the west
[SPEAKER_06]: coast on a boat and you got it You got a
trans you got to go over all the mountains
[SPEAKER_06]: and then that but The prairies or end up
at the East Coast, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you start up the hill It's like
you're looking at the top of this mountain
[SPEAKER_06]: and you can't see anything beyond the hill
until you get to the top Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when you look down on the other
side, you can see that there's a whole
[SPEAKER_06]: nother mountain range and a whole nother
Set of challenges that you have to face
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's kind of the way that I look at
plant breeding Like it's this goal.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's never done.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're you're embarking on a project the
Never done because a plant bulletproof
[SPEAKER_06]: Plants that we're gonna make over the next
20 years, you know We're gonna come along
[SPEAKER_06]: and find some flaw that we've bred into
the plants because that's just the way
[SPEAKER_06]: that Plant breeding goes right every time
you make a grow you make an adjustment to
[SPEAKER_06]: the performance of some trade You might
have fixed one problem But now that allows
[SPEAKER_06]: you to see a whole new problem that you
couldn't see in the plant before So for me
[SPEAKER_06]: like I don't look at plant breeding in
that in that way Yeah, plant never stops
[SPEAKER_06]: right it never stops it always goes on and
on and it's this funny pitch that I you
[SPEAKER_06]: know, unfortunately I have to have with
investors because it's like they want to
[SPEAKER_06]: understand it's like, you know The the
investor mentality is that you want to
[SPEAKER_06]: hear like if I put in X amount It's gonna
return me, you know, it's gonna give me an
[SPEAKER_06]: ROI of whatever hundred percent or
whatever it is Right and when you tell
[SPEAKER_06]: them that it's this like ongoing expense
that's always gonna go Painful for some
[SPEAKER_06]: CFOs To understand when they're thinking
of cannabis like it's a widget,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: but the truth is is that's what trade
optimization is about and This is one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the key areas That really hasn't been
addressed in my opinion in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry is that area of true innovation,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: there's all the stuff that you can do in
extraction and processes and delivery
[SPEAKER_06]: methods and you know skew formats and all
that kind of stuff, but it always comes
[SPEAKER_06]: back to the plant right and You know in
terms of trade optimization, you know
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark's talking about grain size or
Chemical profile and you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: these are important traits, of course,
but you can essentially, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we could optimize hemp for Hemp creep
production or you know the the production
[SPEAKER_06]: of they're using it for five hemp fibers
for graphene You could probably breed a
[SPEAKER_06]: variety that makes really nice graphene,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know as we all know now we can
optimize the cannabinoids and the terpene
[SPEAKER_06]: contents and profiles But really any any
any trade in the plant we can optimize for
[SPEAKER_06]: a given purpose So, you know once we do
seed size, maybe it's seed profile,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We start having different hemp seeds with
different chemical profiles in them as
[SPEAKER_04]: well So yeah, there's a lot we can do I
Mean, well any name name a perfect tomato
[SPEAKER_04]: plant right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean go to the store and buy them You
know, they're grown there's a perfect
[SPEAKER_04]: plant for that hothouse or you know for
when set farms or whoever it is trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: produce a certain amount By a certain date
to make their money, but that's not the
[SPEAKER_04]: most desirable tomato for say the consumer
I mean, there's there's much tastier
[SPEAKER_04]: tomatoes than the pink hothouse ones,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's reason that there's specific
for particular, you know production schema
[SPEAKER_04]: and Continual innovation and all plants
Potatoes, you know, what makes a better
[SPEAKER_04]: chip what makes a better french fry,
you know all that stuff I think from a
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial standpoint there's you know,
you see it pretty consistently and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: it's People are there's some leaps and
bounds that need to happen with the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: in terms of like labor reduction you know,
there's this kind of obsession with
[SPEAKER_05]: touching the plant and manipulating the
plant and you know, it could be things
[SPEAKER_05]: like can we breed something that has like
a enough turgidity that it doesn't need to
[SPEAKER_05]: Be supported by a trellis as an example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there something?
[SPEAKER_05]: With like that perfect balance of leaf to
calyx ratio In some of these other kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: areas where you know Especially on the
disease resistant side or or pest
[SPEAKER_05]: resistance side You watch a lot of people
just dump time and labor into crops and if
[SPEAKER_05]: we could get the genetics just a few steps
above It would really kind of help out the
[SPEAKER_05]: farmer We tend to touch this plant too
much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like if we could get some of
these breeding building blocks established
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we could touch it a little bit less
let the plants kind of do the heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: lifting for us And that's a really good
point Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna say that that's a really good
point because you know as mark brought up,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know We can go to our local Nursery as
hobbyists plant growers and we can you
[SPEAKER_03]: know choose between all these amazing
plant varieties But when you go to the
[SPEAKER_03]: grocery store There's only usually a few
tomato varieties to select within any one
[SPEAKER_03]: market and that has to do with
optimization for the farmer for production
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that one of our challenges
moving forward as we're able to to develop
[SPEAKER_03]: these varieties is we have to have a
starting point like Ryan said got to get
[SPEAKER_03]: over that mountain before we get to the
plateau and As we're exploring,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know marker assisted breeding or or
triploids or all these new amazing ways to
[SPEAKER_03]: develop these new varieties You have to
have a starting point which is what what?
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what are the base building
blocks that we're going to go on to move
[SPEAKER_03]: from there and I think that that one of
our challenges that we have in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry is that there's there's a lot of
diversity in the market and not as much
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity in the genome in terms of Colors
to choose from and blocks to choose from
[SPEAKER_03]: so once that diversity in the market sends
down a little bit similar to that
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity at the supermarket Then we can
really optimize those varieties for
[SPEAKER_03]: different production techniques for for
different You know for different traits
[SPEAKER_03]: like like turgidity and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it's really challenging I see you
know, like You know as the the market
[SPEAKER_03]: continues to shift and the new strain de
jour shows up then that strain is now the
[SPEAKER_03]: new starting point and then a year later
There's a new strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a new starting point right your
cultivar So I think that like collectively
[SPEAKER_03]: as an industry we kind of have to search a
little bit deeper Into what we want these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants to produce in terms of compounds or
in terms of products industrial materials
[SPEAKER_03]: before we can really start to optimize
their traits Well, and the problem with
[SPEAKER_04]: being an innovator is that if you have
these really great products to genetics to
[SPEAKER_04]: go to a farmer You're five or ten years
ahead and your vocabulary and how you
[SPEAKER_04]: speak about the plants, you know You talk
about type one type two type three to a
[SPEAKER_04]: normal farmer They just kind of shrug and
say how much THC does it produce and
[SPEAKER_04]: what's the yield that they don't really
even care about terpene profiles right now
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're not The market isn't
hasn't been educated enough For the level
[SPEAKER_04]: of sophistication to be high enough to
even realize or explore these different,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know chemo types That's just the chemo
type trait of it as well Let me just get
[SPEAKER_06]: this in a lot of these traits that we're
talking about as well that have kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: been judged, you know, especially in the
cannabis cup circuits or Emerald cup or
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all done on flavor and perception,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so those are all important traits that
appeal to the consumer the end consumer
[SPEAKER_06]: But typically plant breeding especially
plant breeding for agriculture is done
[SPEAKER_06]: with the the you know The customer and
client for the breeder is a is the the
[SPEAKER_06]: grower, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the end consumer By corollary
there the end consumers is also the
[SPEAKER_06]: customer but really like the plant breeder
serves the ag industry in not the the weed
[SPEAKER_06]: buying public right and so I think a lot
of the a lot of the breeding that's been
[SPEAKER_06]: done on the on the small scale with people
making crosses and winning cups like You
[SPEAKER_06]: might end up with some like, you know some
special plants that taste pretty good But
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think these are gonna be the
plants that are the bulletproof plants
[SPEAKER_06]: that we end up with in cannabis Right and
it kind of brings me to this concept that
[SPEAKER_06]: I use sometimes and it's something that
we've seen really of all of the last 20
[SPEAKER_06]: years is the industry going from like
Growers plants to what I call smokers
[SPEAKER_06]: plants, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know OG would be a smokers plan or
a cookies would be a smokers plant like
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything about the plant in the essence
is really in those in those plants is
[SPEAKER_06]: guided towards the consumer You know,
they're really finicky to grow and they
[SPEAKER_06]: have a small yield but the the smokers
really want to have those plants whereas
[SPEAKER_06]: like you know something big like the old
hash plants or the You know the big buzz
[SPEAKER_06]: that all the you know The biker folks used
to grow back in the 80s and where a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: our hash plants kind of came from,
you know The emphasis back then was on
[SPEAKER_06]: yield, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so because it was like any pound that
you could you could go you could sell for
[SPEAKER_06]: big bucks It didn't have that level of
connoisseur quality that that appeals
[SPEAKER_06]: today, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so That's something that's gonna
really happen is that we're you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we've we're almost kind of
hitting optimization For those smokers
[SPEAKER_06]: plants like the plants that the consumers
want but really what we need to do is make
[SPEAKER_06]: those plants into more robust versions of
themselves The the needs of the producers
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said again plant architecture like
you said Michael their ability to To to
[SPEAKER_06]: stay rigid and tall and self-support
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that can save a producer time and
money labor costs, you know the amount of
[SPEAKER_06]: Leaf that you have to trim off a plant,
you know all that kind of stuff makes a
[SPEAKER_06]: huge impact and Obviously when we're
talking about pests and pathogen
[SPEAKER_06]: resistance as well Like those are all
traits that benefit the grower not
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily the smoker, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: and so I think one of the things that
we're definitely going to see is Those
[SPEAKER_06]: kinds of traits being developed using like
molecular techniques and QT L's and that
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of stuff Yeah, no that makes it makes
perfect sense and it kind of ties really
[SPEAKER_05]: nice into the next question Which is what
are the modern ag tech tools and
[SPEAKER_05]: innovations available to cannabis plant
breeders?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, oftentimes we think of tools as
a physical tangible thing and and now
[SPEAKER_05]: we're starting to talk about digital tools
in sharing data You know across across the
[SPEAKER_05]: borders and things like that where we
couldn't share certain other elements
[SPEAKER_05]: before Due to regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to touch base a little bit on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them marker assisted breeding and
some of these tools that yours referencing
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so genome sequencing and
biotechnology really has really opened the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole book up for What we can do during
love or you know animal or plant life But
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, it's more accepted in the
context of plant life making crosses.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just mating plants together from
within the family and Ending up with
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever it comes, but we can do all sorts
of things to the plants to make that
[SPEAKER_06]: process much more efficient and what we're
doing and Now that we've sequenced the
[SPEAKER_06]: entire cannabis genome, you know over the
last 30 years people have been working out
[SPEAKER_06]: what all these different genes do in
Arabidopsis and these model plants and
[SPEAKER_06]: corn and barley and every other You know
major ag crop that we can think of and
[SPEAKER_06]: we've begun to understand these genes and
just like in the animal kingdom Those
[SPEAKER_06]: genes are conserved or shared across all
different types of plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, like for example The the
genes involved in harvesting sunlight and
[SPEAKER_06]: and photosynthesis obviously like those
genes are conserved across all plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: right and and So as we've begun to like,
you know figure out this big hairball and
[SPEAKER_06]: and and learn what these genes do across
all these different species Now that we've
[SPEAKER_06]: sequenced the cannabis genome We're
starting to get all of this Information
[SPEAKER_06]: and understanding about what the genes and
the Canada, you know both the genes that
[SPEAKER_06]: are unique to the cannabis plants and how
we can Learn about and play with those
[SPEAKER_06]: genes, but also how we can take our
knowledge from other species about like
[SPEAKER_06]: for example powdery mildew resistance or
resists resistance to botrytis right and
[SPEAKER_06]: how we can actually use the lessons that
we've learned in other plants to Make some
[SPEAKER_06]: better breeding choices in cannabis as
well, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and that's kind of how you find if
you already found pathogen resistant gene
[SPEAKER_04]: and hops or another species you can see if
that happens to be conserved across
[SPEAKER_04]: Through the cannabis as well and you know
Use the same sequence and look for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that didn't someone do that
Ryan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh I'm not sure there with what the work
is correlated to the hops But yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot like I said a lot of these pathways
are they're conserved all the way across.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, there's something called
polygalactarone Which is a gene that's
[SPEAKER_06]: involved in a whole bunch of different
things But you know, it's something that
[SPEAKER_06]: can be Certain fungus is when they attack
the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can produce more this thing
essentially helps break down the plant and
[SPEAKER_06]: so we can certain plants have these
they're called PGI peas or black to go on
[SPEAKER_06]: sorry pot polygalactarone is inhibitory
proteins and You know certain versions of
[SPEAKER_06]: these genes or certain plant lines have
more copies of these genes Or resistant,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, for example, you know,
but right a scenario gray mold So anyway,
[SPEAKER_06]: the point is is that yeah, we can we can
look for these sequences and again Like I
[SPEAKER_06]: was saying before it's one of those kind
of the special things about cannabis You
[SPEAKER_06]: know a lot of these selfing species like
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have They've gone through these
genetic bottlenecks that they made them
[SPEAKER_06]: much more easy to breed within themselves
and remain true to type but The way that
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis breeds, like I've said before in
the past, I think It cannabis breeds more
[SPEAKER_06]: like humans and so if you look at humans
for any given trait Eye color hair color
[SPEAKER_06]: skin color height, you know, there's
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this vast continuum of performance
Across any given trait and that that
[SPEAKER_06]: that's happened because humans have gone
all over the world and no mutation They
[SPEAKER_06]: happen they just happen within it any
given genome, right and that becomes a
[SPEAKER_06]: marker for like a mutation event that
happened in one place at one specific time
[SPEAKER_06]: and all plant and all plants are people
that descend from that mutation are going
[SPEAKER_06]: to share that common trait right and so
over time like the branches on our family
[SPEAKER_06]: tree they change they have all these
little, you know changes and variation and
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis is full of these little changes
all the way across the genome and So,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, I think in the context of how
we're going to use this information to
[SPEAKER_06]: make better plants in the future It's all
fine and dandy to have these fancy tools
[SPEAKER_06]: but really like I you know, for example
for the G to s the the molecular screen at
[SPEAKER_06]: your sorry the genome wide associations Or
or GBS genome Or genotyping by sequencing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of discovery work to still
do To understand what these genetic
[SPEAKER_06]: variation variants mean, you know,
we've all seen with the kovat thing again
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's it's kind of like a great
everybody's having this public lesson of
[SPEAKER_06]: biotechnology, but you know, everybody
knows what a variant is now right and so
[SPEAKER_06]: You can kind of think of the cannabis
genome is that every gene has a variant
[SPEAKER_06]: and we need to understand what those gene
variants mean in the context of the plant
[SPEAKER_06]: and Then we kind of need to catalog all
the different variants And that is and
[SPEAKER_06]: then figure out how we put them back
together in different ways Right to to
[SPEAKER_06]: yield genetic outcomes that we want which
is really what we were doing with the
[SPEAKER_06]: chemical analysis Breeding program with
mark and I don't doing down in California,
[SPEAKER_06]: right is we were using the lab to screen
for these chemical variants And then
[SPEAKER_06]: selecting those plants and using them for
screening and creating new families,
[SPEAKER_06]: right and combining them in different ways
and it's the combination of those
[SPEAKER_06]: different sets of gene variants that leads
you to get CBG or THCV right or CBG VV is
[SPEAKER_06]: a good example because it's those two
previous ones put together So so beyond
[SPEAKER_05]: the fact that there's a ton of discovery
to do as growers and breeders are Making
[SPEAKER_05]: you know new discoveries and collecting
more Data.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do these tools help support things
like IP protection?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do they help support things like IP
protection?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's enough way does someone else
want to take that one mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to take that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, you know a perfect way to create a
bulletproof plant would be for example to
[SPEAKER_04]: really tap cannabis is potential by let's
see cannabis has the olive talic acid
[SPEAKER_04]: Pathway, so does something called
streptomyces You use streptomyces to to
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially brew Anticancer chemotherapies
like bleomycin if you could CRISPR in a
[SPEAKER_04]: nice gene to follow that alloptoic acid
pathway Have the cannabis plant creating
[SPEAKER_04]: real pharmaceutical Anticancer
chemotherapies in the trichome That would
[SPEAKER_04]: be like a bulletproof plant almost similar
as how the roundup ready gene is
[SPEAKER_04]: Distributed across multiple plants
Monsanto could certainly do that with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean in theory Hey, Mark, would you mind
maybe for some of the newer listeners
[SPEAKER_05]: given kind of just like a kind of a gentle
breakdown on Marker assisted selection and
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of snip clips and kind of how those
function and breeding Well, I'm Definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: not the smartest guy on this call to do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely Ryan and But Euro fins and
medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_04]: They recently launched a snip chip for
hemp And they'll provide You know the the
[SPEAKER_04]: snip suits I believe they provide the snip
sequences and medicinal genomics does a
[SPEAKER_04]: nice workup to Help you correlate a trait
that you might observe in the plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: you could have a control plant and you
could snip chip You know get the data for
[SPEAKER_04]: both of them compare the data and if you
can find a pattern that correlates to your
[SPEAKER_04]: morphological or Chemotaxonomical data
then you can use that marker to further
[SPEAKER_04]: your breeding program without you know
Growing your plant all the way out or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like I said Ryan probably way
better Breaking this down than I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Ryan There's an interesting question
that came in and it's when will genetic
[SPEAKER_05]: markers be for intersex plants be
available?
[SPEAKER_05]: And is this something that's possible?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can speak to that Well, there's it's
funny because you have all these different
[SPEAKER_06]: claims from companies There's a Canadian
company that's claiming they have the test
[SPEAKER_06]: for it But you know, they haven't they
haven't published on it and they haven't
[SPEAKER_06]: opened it up to external validation So
it's kind of hard to to really say that
[SPEAKER_06]: they do have the test or not, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually eventually we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was recently a Canadian group again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I mentioned On the last call that
there was a group There are our last You
[SPEAKER_06]: know little whatever all zoom panel
There's a group in Canada I think from UBC
[SPEAKER_06]: and they just did a set of studies where
they were looking at the genes that were
[SPEAKER_06]: turned on and off by spraying STS on the
plants or yeah STS on the plant STS for
[SPEAKER_06]: those that don't know is a chemical called
silver thiosulfate and it interferes with
[SPEAKER_06]: ethylene production in in all plants but
in chemistry That leads to the induction
[SPEAKER_06]: of male flowers on female plants So
essentially they sprayed STS look on the
[SPEAKER_06]: plants and then looked at which genes
changed their levels of transcription And
[SPEAKER_06]: so there's probably a good candidate set
of genes in there Related to obviously the
[SPEAKER_06]: differences between male and female male
flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're gonna get some cues As the
next few serious experiments come out of
[SPEAKER_06]: that line of work I mean, I can't really
get it could be tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be, you know, five years from now
Okay, I don't know the intersex is
[SPEAKER_06]: probably I don't think that's the most
important trait that people are looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be really nice to understand the
entire sex story in cannabis But I think
[SPEAKER_06]: that there's other traits that people are
chasing More importantly, you know and
[SPEAKER_06]: that that's something that we'll learn
kind of as we go along No, no,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's great it's it's an honest answer You
know and we've had some innovations come
[SPEAKER_05]: out of some of these tools that have
helped us kind of get to some of these
[SPEAKER_05]: goals a little bit faster one of them
being auto flower varieties and another
[SPEAKER_05]: being Triploids so I wasn't sure Who'd be
the best one to kind of start on auto
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know Mojave.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something you want to you want to
take?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well as we mentioned earlier, you know
auto flowers are a perfect example of a
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer Innovation that you know people
don't generally seek out of flowers for
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking It hasn't been like the market
hasn't been pushing towards auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they open up a lot of opportunity for
farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So You know, there's been over the past
few years but a lot of improvement in the
[SPEAKER_03]: auto flower market we're seeing plants
that are getting close to what A consumer
[SPEAKER_03]: would consider desirable Obviously there
are a lot of amazing out of flowers,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're not quite at what a
traditional photo period plant does but
[SPEAKER_03]: we're getting there so that's an
innovation that really really,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know was Driven by a farmers need to
you know, utilize different different
[SPEAKER_03]: regions different times of the year for
production and one great tool that Sega
[SPEAKER_03]: has developed is they have a patent
pending technology for actually
[SPEAKER_03]: Micropropagation of auto flower which is
really going to have a lot of impact
[SPEAKER_03]: because as everyone knows with auto flower
You can't hold the plant in vegetative
[SPEAKER_03]: state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be an important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we've seen a bunch of especially in
California a major increase in people
[SPEAKER_05]: seeking auto flower seed maybe they have
Don't quite have the infrastructure tools
[SPEAKER_05]: in place in their greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's kind of an alternative for
them It's also a clean start in a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: cases for them as well Rob, can you speak
a little bit of when we kind of saw auto
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers kind of come around and kind of
what what caused the the peak interest in
[SPEAKER_02]: the early days with auto flowers You're
basically a Auto flower is In its correct
[SPEAKER_02]: definition is a plant that's photo period
neutral That means that it flowers based
[SPEAKER_02]: on time how old the plant is how Developed
it is rather than when the lights go on
[SPEAKER_02]: and off So they don't flower because of
long day lengths or flower because of
[SPEAKER_02]: short day lengths Long night lengths is
more accurate way to look at it as
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis But flower whenever they reach a
certain developmental age And That means
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially that he put it in the ground
and it flowers a certain number of weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: later No matter what time of the year it
is This has been sort of the holy grail
[SPEAKER_02]: for readers for a long time the first
person to really jump into this was
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville Schumacher god rest his soul,
but He he tried this experiment with feral
[SPEAKER_02]: Hungarian varieties Which are very weedy
and like wild plants that there were
[SPEAKER_02]: escapes from cultivation They're not
really wild plants, but they've gone back
[SPEAKER_02]: to many of the wild traits and that
includes maturing seeds relatively early
[SPEAKER_02]: But wild plants have a shotgun approach to
survival And that also means that those
[SPEAKER_02]: same plants produce seeds very late If the
season was abnormally long that year they
[SPEAKER_02]: produced Seeds that also matured quite
late.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had seeds falling off those plants
To find themselves in a situation where
[SPEAKER_02]: they would grow the next spring When those
plants were crossed in with with modern
[SPEAKER_02]: dope varieties what you ended up with was
Varieties that never really matured and
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis drug cannabis fries any
cannabis varieties whether you're after
[SPEAKER_02]: seed or or The drug portion you need
female flowers that mature and finish they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't just continue making seeds or or
trichomes and And go on and on until they
[SPEAKER_02]: freeze to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the problem with the first
ones Maybe they were not truly auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers maybe they just had a different
sort of trait that Breeders in those days
[SPEAKER_02]: hoped were auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They met with no success They dropped out
of the picture completely for at least a
[SPEAKER_02]: decade and then the new auto flowers came
along Bad with my years, but I would say
[SPEAKER_02]: well Neville started his projects in the
early 80s mid 80s We didn't hear about
[SPEAKER_02]: They were called auto flowers that were
early maturing varieties Like yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're early to flower, but they really
mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you what do you say?
[SPEAKER_06]: He called him he called them ruderalis
hybrid ruderalis is what he said was yes
[SPEAKER_06]: his germ They weren't really ruderalis,
but you know, even even ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean ruderalis wasn't born, you know
What's it what's it called like the Jesus
[SPEAKER_06]: birthday is like divine birth.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a divine birth Right but you
know it It ended up in Russia because
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody brought hemp seeds Cannabis seeds
to Russia at some point in time into these
[SPEAKER_06]: northern climes and planted them and the
only plants that survived Were the ones
[SPEAKER_06]: that had that phenotype that would start
setting flowers from seed right or
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever 50 days from sick from
germination right and so when the early
[SPEAKER_06]: frost came only the plants that would have
Had matured seed would have been genetic
[SPEAKER_06]: contributors to that The next generation
anything with a longer Flowering period
[SPEAKER_06]: would have would have gotten wiped out
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was really a big bottlenecking
that brought that Auto flowering is
[SPEAKER_06]: actually the one thing that makes it an
interesting trait in the context of
[SPEAKER_06]: discussion I think is that it's what's
called a single nuclear recessive Gene and
[SPEAKER_06]: that just means it's one genetic mutation
at a place on one chromosome And if you
[SPEAKER_06]: have two copies of that gene you end up
with the auto flowering trait If you get
[SPEAKER_06]: only get one copy of that trait you end up
with plants that flower moderately quickly
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you have no copies then it's just a
standard, you know photo period plant or
[SPEAKER_06]: photo period determinate plant Which is
really different from a lot of these other
[SPEAKER_06]: traits when we're talking about like
yield, you know Or even pathogen
[SPEAKER_06]: resistance those traits are respond that
they're called like polygenic traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really Like the additive effect of
up to like, you know a hundred genes for
[SPEAKER_06]: example that all contribute together and
add up little bits at a time to create
[SPEAKER_06]: what we consider, you know a plant that's
bulletproof in terms of Pathogen
[SPEAKER_06]: resistance Or yield right It's up you
actually optimize yield to its highest
[SPEAKER_06]: point and breeding for those kinds of
traits is much different than auto
[SPEAKER_06]: flowering traits, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Auto flowering traits are easy to track
Even just as a visual phenotypic marker,
[SPEAKER_06]: obviously because it's different flowering
the rest of the plants, but you can also
[SPEAKER_06]: track it with Molecular genetics whereas
if you're trying to do that molecular
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics approach to a polygenic trait
It's much more complex, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a discussion around kind of
like I guess like a ploidy conversation so
[SPEAKER_05]: for everyone who maybe Not up to speed on
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you kind of maybe give us a breakdown
of a polyploid?
[SPEAKER_05]: versus a triploid and kind of I know
there's been a lot of noise in the news
[SPEAKER_05]: from the Crawford Brothers Over at Oregon
CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got some things that they're
releasing this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: They seem pretty excited about I Mean the
best example in my opinion for teaching
[SPEAKER_06]: about polyploid is looking at bananas,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So bananas the ones that we see
commercially in the superstore or in the
[SPEAKER_06]: in the grocery store every Where in the
world those those bananas have three sets
[SPEAKER_06]: of chromosomes rather than two and so,
you know the standard condition for For
[SPEAKER_06]: most plants in most of their stages of
life is to have two sets of chromosomes
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we as humans do we have one full set
of our chromosomes from our mom and one
[SPEAKER_06]: from her dad There's a little breeding
trick that you can do to end up with
[SPEAKER_06]: plants that have three copies and it
involves using chemical Or chemical dunk
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially, you know exposing a plant to
a chemical that force that it inhibits the
[SPEAKER_06]: cells when they're dividing in a specific
way it blocked the formation of spindle
[SPEAKER_06]: fibers during meiosis and the the net
result is that when you cry you you can
[SPEAKER_06]: create has four copies of a chromosome of
Sorry four copies of chromosomes and then
[SPEAKER_06]: when you breed that plant to a plant a
normal plant that has two copies of
[SPEAKER_06]: chromosomes you end up with plants that
have three copies of chromosomes and
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole bunch of different things
that can happen in the plant depending on
[SPEAKER_06]: the species in bananas the the most
important agronomic trait was that The
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds in the banana became like
infinitesimally small So when you break a
[SPEAKER_06]: banana open and you you're looking at a
cross section, there's those tiny little
[SPEAKER_06]: black dots You know in a wild banana,
they're not tiny little dots.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're seeds that would like really
bother your Teeth if you're trying to eat
[SPEAKER_06]: a banana, so through making poly or sorry
triploid plants we were able to you know
[SPEAKER_06]: destroy the ability for these plants to
make seeds and In fact, it's something
[SPEAKER_06]: that the Crawford brothers are saying has
happened also with the cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is to be expected that they became
almost Sterile right and so these
[SPEAKER_06]: particular triploid plants because of you
know, because they have three sets of
[SPEAKER_06]: genetic chromosomes in the in the meiosis
process or the formation of a of a gamete
[SPEAKER_06]: with a pollen and ovary, you know,
it doesn't work properly because there's
[SPEAKER_06]: an imbalance a number of chromosomes and
That leads to the seed dying right or
[SPEAKER_06]: never forming But interestingly,
you know, it also does other things
[SPEAKER_06]: because it gives you rather than having
two sets of genes You can now have three
[SPEAKER_06]: genes So it allows you to stack genes in a
different way within a different within a
[SPEAKER_06]: given plant and they're saying that
they're having you know success and
[SPEAKER_06]: increased terpene and cannabinoid content
and Perhaps interesting new profiles
[SPEAKER_06]: because you can have you know rather than
having an interaction of two copies of the
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene synthases now You might have three
copies of the terpene synthases that are
[SPEAKER_06]: all different and that you know,
theoretically could lead To some new
[SPEAKER_06]: phenotype that we haven't seen yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's fascinating Well,
and also dr. Richardson did this work with
[SPEAKER_04]: the watermelon?
[SPEAKER_04]: As you all know the seedless watermelon
seedless watermelon, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Triploid watermelon and more recently They
use these techniques with maize to
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially skip ten years of conventional
breeding to get a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_04]: homozygous plants that breed new hybrids
It's all the really non GMO corn can do to
[SPEAKER_04]: stay competitive it's really interesting
and it's kind of Good technique because
[SPEAKER_04]: you get the double haploid pretty weak But
you know that f1 is 100% homozygous and if
[SPEAKER_04]: you get a fit population it works really
well The growers out there to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes there's confusion between like
mutation or fasciation and like ploidy Can
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys talk to some of the differences
there that you see?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was I don't know how those two
got confused over world phyllotaxi,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is the number of branches on a plant
somehow got confused with the number of
[SPEAKER_06]: chromosomes in a plant and They're totally
different things like one you can see
[SPEAKER_06]: within your eyes and the other one you
can't right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But somehow in the stone or lore they they
ended up as the same thing Paul poly
[SPEAKER_06]: ploids or or better yet and you ploids Are
essentially variations that we can do we
[SPEAKER_06]: can induce in plants on the number of
Chromosomes they have so there's like for
[SPEAKER_06]: example, there's wheat varieties that I
believe are hexa ploid They have six sets
[SPEAKER_06]: of chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know if cannabis typically has ten
sense of chromosomes in one You know
[SPEAKER_06]: single genome inherited from the mother
like I'm talking about a genome in a
[SPEAKER_06]: pollen grain technically when a pollen
Brain and an ovary, you know, they fuse
[SPEAKER_06]: and you have Yeah fertilization from that
point on the plant we refer to it as its
[SPEAKER_06]: genome, but really it's Two singular
genomes one inherited from mom and one
[SPEAKER_06]: from dad Right and so you can create
plants with two four six or eight Copies
[SPEAKER_06]: of those genes and those are what are we
refer to as poly ploids?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you get into any employees which
are like, you know You have eight copies
[SPEAKER_06]: of one chromosome, but only seven copies
of another for example or three copies of
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, three copies of five chromosomes
and a few less of other chromosomes You're
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially adding or deleting extra
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Know there was some excitement to with
you know, obviously we all know that
[SPEAKER_05]: there's feral hemp growing everywhere
There's people trying to grow hemp and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a ton of cross pollination
happening and it seemed like a lot of the
[SPEAKER_05]: excitement was around the potential for
cannabis flower to kind of exist or
[SPEAKER_05]: coexist without being seeded by some of
these new varieties well like Brian said
[SPEAKER_04]: the seeds didn't go away completely in the
banana and I'm sure you've seen a White
[SPEAKER_04]: immature seed in a watermelon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to say it's probably very
similar Yeah down significantly but you
[SPEAKER_02]: know seeds will exist or mutation will
exist exactly the results we Realized
[SPEAKER_02]: quite a while ago in Hungary back in the
day taking Finding true Tetra ploids not
[SPEAKER_02]: any ploids that had one extra of one
chromosome one less of another but ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that were pure tetra ploids with Four sets
of chromosomes twice as many as a normal
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant and crossing those with diploids to
make triploids, which is the watermelon
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy I might point out for a minute
the bananas were a naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_02]: Triploid There wasn't a product of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a product of something Selection
and cloning Watermelons are a product of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding and we tried the same thing and
we got exactly what Mark's talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got those nasty little nubs that
are actually just as unpleasant as the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed and you couldn't roll them out in a
shoebox lid They're just in there and they
[SPEAKER_02]: still taste nasty and it's not what people
want in their cannabis, which is why
[SPEAKER_02]: Groups haven't really moved forward to the
triploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they won't make a full-on seed but
they still have a little shriveled ovule
[SPEAKER_02]: in there that is a seed precursor,
let's say Was that work done?
[SPEAKER_02]: Work was done with the dr. Yvonne Bocha in
Hungary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes Yeah, and you know, but for the hemp
game, it's it's genius right because what
[SPEAKER_04]: happened Previously where the CBG was
released then the next year everybody had
[SPEAKER_04]: this heterozygous Auto CBG seed that they
were Selling but now you can't if it
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't if it doesn't complete a Mature a
seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you have to buy the seed again next
year So it's it's good for business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're extracting and the seed
doesn't form Fully and get oils built up
[SPEAKER_04]: in them then for extraction you probably
have less You know byproduct from the the
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp seed oil
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people want to jump to Q&A
So I'm gonna kind of jump into this next
[SPEAKER_05]: question and we can keep it somewhat brief
But how will the cannabis breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: competitive landscape evolve in the coming
years?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mahave you want to take a stab at that
one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, hopefully it'll kind of move
out from this Fascination with
[SPEAKER_03]: phenohunting through all these poly
hybrids And move towards kind of a more
[SPEAKER_03]: focused attempt to isolate specific lines
and See what that can bring because we you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, we we know that there's there's so
much that cannabis can can offer in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of its compounds and and industrial
applications, but I really feel strongly
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have to kind of isolate and start
working on specific traits so that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: In the future make the the hybrids that
really, you know Work for specific
[SPEAKER_03]: applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean look at the we're talking about
triploids You know, they had to develop
[SPEAKER_03]: the the diploid versions of the these F1s
that they're releasing, you know So that
[SPEAKER_03]: was a considerable amount of breeding and
then they had to you know Had to find the
[SPEAKER_03]: tetraploid versions that didn't have a
bunch of deleterious Chromosomes that you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, I guess it goes both ways You know,
everyone kind of thinks of triploids as
[SPEAKER_03]: being this amazing super plant But it
could also bring a lot of negative
[SPEAKER_03]: attributes as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a matter of isolating and
working at you know Having having a
[SPEAKER_03]: variety that is just high in a particular
chemical profile and also has an
[SPEAKER_03]: advantageous trait such as structure and
working on that specifically so that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can create a short plant high in limonene
and a long lanky plant high in turpinoline
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever and just have the ability to
make a bunch of F1s from those as you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, kind of like weeding out the poly
hybrids I see that as being an important
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding strategy as opposed to trying to
get as much into each individual plant as
[SPEAKER_03]: right now we're kind of obsessed with
bringing everything in and throwing it all
[SPEAKER_03]: into this one individual cultivar,
but Yeah Cannabis I I don't think cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: is ready for exploiting triploids and you
know That kind of stuff yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just there's a lot of work that needs
to be done still Making plants uniform
[SPEAKER_06]: stabilizing genes like even basic genes
for color flavor or cannabinoid content,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know Every time you add another trait
Into the mix things get much more complex,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you're juggling more balls,
but it's exponential Right every literally
[SPEAKER_06]: every time you add another trait that
you're trying to maintain a population You
[SPEAKER_06]: have to grow more plants to find The ones
that have you know, the combination of all
[SPEAKER_05]: the things that you're looking for the
balance Yeah, it seems like you know with
[SPEAKER_05]: the triploids they're saying oh,
well, you know, we're seeing increased
[SPEAKER_05]: yields But they're also seeing increased
petritis in molds and mildews,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know because the bud structure so
dense Well, it might not even be the blood
[SPEAKER_06]: bud structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like that's kind of one of the things
I'm talking about like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: look everybody's growing these cushions
The cushions are extremely susceptible to
[SPEAKER_06]: powdery mildew, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because they have a set of genes in
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're there again They're not optimized
for resistance to powdery mildew So when
[SPEAKER_06]: you take those plants and now you've got
three copies of them, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got three doses like that's one of
the things about triploids like you're
[SPEAKER_06]: saying it's like you get some good things
or my hobby was saying you get good things
[SPEAKER_06]: that come along, but you also Any any
traits or any copies of genes that you
[SPEAKER_06]: have that are?
[SPEAKER_06]: below par Right below 50% you're actually
making the plant worse, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And and now you've got three copies of
them in a plant not two.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's it's One it's a lot harder to
breed with But yeah, it's like this like I
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of just feel like there's some more
stabilization we kind of need to do in
[SPEAKER_06]: some of these basic like house jeez
housekeeping genes I mean, it's like
[SPEAKER_06]: building a really Complex big house on a
tiny little foundation, you know It's like
[SPEAKER_06]: at a certain point in time the whole thing
is gonna collapse and just because of the
[SPEAKER_06]: way that cannabis has been left out of the
agricultural improvement breeding scene
[SPEAKER_06]: for the last 75 years which is when all
crops have really made the leaps and
[SPEAKER_06]: bounds in terms of technology and
improvements You know cannabis was kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: left to people breeding plants in closets
or you know, at least it wasn't being done
[SPEAKER_06]: on a scientific principle and so Cannabis
did get left behind and there's certain
[SPEAKER_06]: consequences involved in that and I feel
like now we're trying to build this really
[SPEAKER_06]: complex structure You know multi-billion
dollar industry on a pretty shaky
[SPEAKER_06]: foundation And we just need to do we need
to sharp the foundation, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we got to do some of these basic
improvements Still and build upon that So
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree This is a question that kind of
comes in and it's for all of you guys So,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know ten years ago was people like
yourselves and people on this panel
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually talking about terpenes
and now it seems like everyone's been
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about turps in the last,
you know a couple years here From an
[SPEAKER_05]: individual perspective Can you can each
panelist please compare where we are today
[SPEAKER_05]: on the terpene front with where we were
ten years ago and can each of you Also,
[SPEAKER_05]: please attempt to project in your crystal
ball where we're going to be ten years
[SPEAKER_02]: from today I can start with that Where we
were Decades ago is where we are now as
[SPEAKER_02]: far as the genetic capability to produce
different terpenes What we've seen is this
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridization of multiple land-race groups
that brought together favorite terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: sweets from each land-race and Maybe the
more technical breeders on this panel can
[SPEAKER_02]: answer this but it seems to me to be a
cumulative inheritance The more terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: Biosynthetic possibilities the more gene
combinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you throw in there the more you
see expressed It's not really one
[SPEAKER_02]: Overriding the others so much and I think
Ryan and Mark can address this more
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically but what we've come up with
is a real tutti frutti blend of dessert
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars and I don't see terpenes
particularly Lacking I see varieties where
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes are more predominant than one
than the other high terpenal variety high
[SPEAKER_02]: karyophylline variety something like this,
but all the other Terpenes are still in
[SPEAKER_02]: there Where's it gonna go?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even sure the terpenes are exactly
falling in with the same inheritance
[SPEAKER_02]: traits that we find inheritance
characteristics we find with other traits
[SPEAKER_02]: be interesting to see what other people
want to say about that, but Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll add to you know, we we don't even
know how much is attributed to terpenes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there's other aromatics Involved
that we're just starting to understand
[SPEAKER_03]: more about I'd like you know, there was
this study just released just last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe proving the efficacy of terpenes
in the entourage effect and I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: was really You know groundbreaking to
really be able to point towards certain
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes having contributing to this
psychoactive effect and once we can kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of isolate and understand more about which
terpenes modulate and and interact with
[SPEAKER_03]: the endocannabinoid system Then we could
start breeding towards those goals so we
[SPEAKER_03]: could have these foundational blocks that
actually target specific conditions or
[SPEAKER_03]: specific, you know traits that people find
desirable in terms of effect because you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, we right now we know lots of
terpenes in a cannabis plant are Dynamic
[SPEAKER_03]: and have a lot of aroma and flavor and
people seem attracted to that just the
[SPEAKER_03]: same way we're attracted to other things
that smell lovely, but if some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes are Possibly getting in the way
of the others, you know kind of in a you
[SPEAKER_03]: know an antagonistic way Getting a better
understanding of what actually needs to be
[SPEAKER_03]: in this plant for it To have this
particular effect and then focusing the
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding towards that particular Chemical
profile and then we can kind of then we
[SPEAKER_03]: can start to look at the variety
improvement based off of you know We now
[SPEAKER_03]: know that this has these these therapeutic
properties that are very specific to this
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene cannabinoid ratio or these other
aromatic You know files or you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: who knows what else is contributing to the
effect?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we can kind of start selecting and
breeding To combine effects to make these
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids these poly hybrids that actually
Do what we as breeders or as consumers or
[SPEAKER_03]: as farmers really want them to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: As opposed to just kind of throwing
everything against the wall and saying
[SPEAKER_03]: these are really loud terpene profiles
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah that paper that you just referenced
Mojave.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe I read and They use four
different models and two suggested The
[SPEAKER_04]: synergy and two were inconclusive and they
were both non Is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you read it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I read it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They injected ridiculously huge equivalent
doses of terpenes into mice and it's it's
[SPEAKER_06]: really quite questionable about whether
you can even Say like they definitely got
[SPEAKER_06]: receptor activation from some of those
terms, but I mean there is zero zero zero
[SPEAKER_06]: chance of you ever achieving those levels
of terpenes physiologically, I mean you'd
[SPEAKER_06]: have to extract like Ten pounds and do it
in one dab, you know, I mean to even have
[SPEAKER_04]: anywhere close of the amount of turps If
you remember in ICRS was it 2017 Dr. Biro
[SPEAKER_04]: and I presented some cellular models for
inflammation that showed that Beta
[SPEAKER_04]: cariophylline and CBD had a synergistic
effect to increase decrease the
[SPEAKER_04]: inflammation in certain cell lines So we
know that that's possible and the dosage
[SPEAKER_04]: in that experiment was more realistic and
true to type and was based on the guava
[SPEAKER_04]: jam and garlic jam whole plant extracts
actually That puts, you know, a good time
[SPEAKER_04]: stamp on that scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the original question was where were
we ten years ago?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where were we today?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten years ago you smelled your weed to buy
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't need to look at a lab report
Today everybody wants to buy the THC
[SPEAKER_04]: number It's like with the phytofax rollout
in California and SC labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're creating an industry standard
Packaging is now switching to have you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, the top three color-coded terpenes
based on the phytofax the consumers
[SPEAKER_04]: getting more educated Ryan and I both know
from our experience that different terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: profiles with the identical cannabinoid
profiles yield different experiences so
[SPEAKER_04]: much so as I can fool many THC users with
certain hemp cultivars that we have in the
[SPEAKER_04]: stable More importantly once the consumer
or once the genetic library is
[SPEAKER_04]: comprehensive enough You know and people
can try all these things that you know
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan and others have tried it It's like
when you go to a store and you say hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the highest THC concentration and
then all of a sudden Thanks to biotech and
[SPEAKER_04]: other breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: They say well, we had there's six of them
at 30% THC There's a Mersene dominant one
[SPEAKER_04]: a pining dominant Osean dominant which
which smell what flavor do you want?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know Alcohol is a good example.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't I mean some people drink
everclear all the time, but even with
[SPEAKER_04]: tequila It's like people prefer the flavor
and then that flavor translates to an
[SPEAKER_04]: experience and because so much of Cannabis
experience is set and setting it's um It
[SPEAKER_04]: needs to be pleasurable you know if you
you take a lungful of anything and it
[SPEAKER_04]: Tastes like a sack of dog poo your
experience is going to follow But if you
[SPEAKER_04]: take a hit of something and you're like,
oh my gosh, this is amazing Your
[SPEAKER_04]: experience is going to follow so there's
this translation and I think that's that's
[SPEAKER_04]: what the consumer is going to ultimately
want is something that tastes good and has
[SPEAKER_04]: a repeatable experience and thanks to
Creating standards that make sense like
[SPEAKER_04]: the color coding on the the phyto print on
the phyto facts It's like you can kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: create a language to communicate to the
consumer But then can translate back to
[SPEAKER_04]: the producer and the breeder so that
everybody's talking the same language and
[SPEAKER_04]: we're all communicating Effectively and
that drives purchase decisions and sales
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to do that just at that point in
time you'll have the 5g chip from the
[SPEAKER_06]: vaccine and then right directly with your
Point-of-sale for for terpene optimization
[SPEAKER_06]: for your genotype No, um, yeah,
I don't know what's gonna be in the future
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean We've seen that the the company
from Israel has just taken hold in In San
[SPEAKER_06]: Diego, there's a company doubt that's just
moved down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's got a license for the technology to
use crisper So that's definitely we're
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna be coming to the market pretty soon
And that's gonna bring a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_06]: different changes in the way that we look
at breeding Cannabis at least in the
[SPEAKER_06]: California market I Think that people are
gonna continue to optimize smells and
[SPEAKER_06]: flavors and Yeah, we'll kind of see what
what it brings I hope where we've moved
[SPEAKER_06]: away from the THC numbers people choosing
the weed by in that way, but who knows
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the you know Trending wise THC still
seems to trump, but there are people I
[SPEAKER_05]: think that are becoming more aware As they
come more aware of their palette and their
[SPEAKER_05]: experience and there's no doubt that you
know You can use the same cultivar over
[SPEAKER_05]: and over again and it just starts to lose
its edge And then someone you know come in
[SPEAKER_05]: with something that's just you know,
it could be half the potency But it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a unique new chemical profile and it
has you know Incredible effects or even
[SPEAKER_05]: stronger effects and what they were using
in some cases.
[SPEAKER_05]: We find that from a retail level A lot of
people have to kind of bounce around,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they're they're not kind of
staying on something for too long We'll
[SPEAKER_05]: have a couple staples, but they're always
floating new cultivars into their kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: daily weekly regiment Variety is the spice
of life All consumers are looking for same
[SPEAKER_05]: same but different yeah, I agree
[SPEAKER_06]: Well Today I mean again like you Like you
think mark was saying you used to be able
[SPEAKER_06]: to go in to see your dealer and stick your
nose a bagger jar and see me like the
[SPEAKER_06]: Smell and you turn you choose what you're
gonna buy if there was choice at all You
[SPEAKER_06]: would choose based on you know,
organoleptic measures right on how it made
[SPEAKER_06]: you Feel or smell or whatever whatever you
like the smell of and we kind of totally
[SPEAKER_06]: fucked up that game It's like now it's
like mark said everybody Everything is
[SPEAKER_06]: done by lab report and you can't see or
touch the butt at least in the Canadian
[SPEAKER_06]: regulated market You know, it's got to be
in an opaque container and you can't you
[SPEAKER_06]: can't smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah You know, they'll have jars or
they'll have these jars open on the
[SPEAKER_06]: counter Or at least I did pre-covid that
you could pick up and smell but you know
[SPEAKER_06]: They've certainly weren't replacing it
with fresh product every day States is the
[SPEAKER_05]: same way I think you know with the
exception maybe Oklahoma and a couple
[SPEAKER_05]: others, you know that kind of let you you
know put your face in it so
[SPEAKER_06]: I Don't want to buy anybody's like weed
that they've shoved up their nose either
[SPEAKER_06]: but you know, like there is there's got to
be a happy medium I think we'll move a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit away from some of these medical
regulations and we'll have we will have
[SPEAKER_06]: like Medical formulated products that are
probably better and more accurate than
[SPEAKER_06]: they are today We'll have more diversity
of non-flower product formats on the
[SPEAKER_05]: market I mean if you look at like a New
Jersey, I think application they're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: I think lounges So, you know, maybe you
can go back to the way it kind of used to
[SPEAKER_05]: be You know in Holland where you could get
a little bit, you know Try it out on the
[SPEAKER_05]: spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you liked it you go down and buy a
little bit more That speaks to the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like are using our own
organoleptic Bioassay we had you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: have that previous experience for It to
hit that nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like if you if if you never tried haze
for instance And you walk into a
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary and you smell haze You don't
make that instant connection that
[SPEAKER_03]: association with the effect that's
associated with that terpene profile So
[SPEAKER_03]: what we're seeing now in California,
you know specifically is we're driven
[SPEAKER_03]: towards these really loud terpene profiles
That people have an instant connection
[SPEAKER_03]: with because they're they relate to other
products in their lives for instance,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so You have to we have to kind
of give people that opportunity through
[SPEAKER_03]: having things like terpene classes and
Guiding them more towards what effects are
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with those terpenes so that
they can learn that Hey me as a person I
[SPEAKER_03]: want this profile If you just let them go
drive by their nose and they don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: any previous experience with all these
different varieties Then they don't get it
[SPEAKER_03]: and I see that a lot with the with the
youth now who don't haven't experienced
[SPEAKER_03]: these Spicy herbaceous woodsy old-school
African and you know haze varieties and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that that when they smell them
It smells witty and and funky and
[SPEAKER_03]: resonate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't take them anywhere because it
doesn't have a history Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get that instant connection
where they just you know, they know so
[SPEAKER_03]: it's we can't let the the consumer guide
the direction that the breeders take us in
[SPEAKER_03]: the way they are now Because the consumer
isn't the market's not mature enough for
[SPEAKER_03]: them to have made the right decisions
Yeah, it's part of the artisan to
[SPEAKER_05]: unfortunately Mark had to had to part
ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a busy man today and we're getting
right here towards the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this one's a bigger question and You
know, you can't really talk about the
[SPEAKER_05]: future without talking about things like
CRISPR or GMOs or gene editing or any of
[SPEAKER_05]: this stuff and I know Ryan you you you
mentioned CRISPR on your last comment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll pick on you here a little bit and
and yeah, how do you how do you see this?
[SPEAKER_05]: technology coming into play here and I
Guess how what does it mean to you in the
[SPEAKER_05]: future cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I kind of put CRISPR in with other
forms of biotechnology That we haven't
[SPEAKER_06]: really even touched at all upon But you
know, there's there's there's breeding You
[SPEAKER_06]: know people talk about genetics and it's
usually focused on either the plant seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: or the breeding techniques that we use to
make those plant seeds But we're now
[SPEAKER_06]: living in a world where there's all sorts
of technologies like CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_06]: So CRISPR is like you can think of it like
a Word processor for genes like we can go
[SPEAKER_06]: in and correct the misspelling of a
genetic word Right or change or change the
[SPEAKER_06]: genetic spelling of a word and make it
mean something else And that's that's
[SPEAKER_06]: really cool but it's like a one-time thing
that we do to change a trait and it's kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of a shortcut
[SPEAKER_06]: You kind of like, you know, we used to do
something called EMS mutation breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: where you'd you'd take plant seeds and
you'd subject them to a Chemical mutagen
[SPEAKER_06]: that would change the DNA in little spots
just randomly and then you grow the seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: out and see what changed and usually that
kind of thing is reserved for Inducing
[SPEAKER_06]: variation in species that don't have
variation Which is very different from
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis because Canada like I said before
cannabis has all this genetic variation
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it breeds like humans do you like
it doesn't breed to itself naturally it
[SPEAKER_06]: normally breeds to a male or female plant
That's a sibling or that's growing in the
[SPEAKER_06]: same patch or a nearby patch, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we can use these methods like
tilling or eco tilling which is a method
[SPEAKER_06]: for Kind of figuring out what these you
know isolating these these genetic rare
[SPEAKER_06]: genetic changes and figuring out what they
do You know, so that's kind of on the
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding end, but there's also this whole
technology That we can do and I think
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody kind of understands,
you know with immunization and and
[SPEAKER_06]: vaccines go on, you know the idea that you
you you get this vaccine and it's it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: virus or a genetic instruction to produce
protein that kind of triggers your immune
[SPEAKER_06]: system and prepares it for the incoming
onslaught of an organism right that you
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're That your immune system hasn't
seen And you can do that same thing with
[SPEAKER_06]: plants I mean we talked last time about
plant viruses and one of the reasons why
[SPEAKER_06]: Tissue culture is useful as we can remove
viruses from from plant lines plant cell
[SPEAKER_06]: lines But you can also use you know,
they're kind of forms of biotechnology to
[SPEAKER_06]: like there's something called The IGS or
viral induced gene silencing right so you
[SPEAKER_06]: Can use you can infect the plant with a
virus that might not do anything too
[SPEAKER_06]: problematic to the plant but it it has a
gene That would interfere with a virus if
[SPEAKER_06]: the virus ever came along right and so you
can actually like engineer immunity into
[SPEAKER_06]: these plants from specific viruses And
there's a whole bunch of different ways
[SPEAKER_06]: that you can do that and it's a whole
field on its own that's you know Cyber can
[SPEAKER_06]: post a host of talk on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's something that's gonna come to
cannabis and we're gonna start seeing
[SPEAKER_06]: plants that are Genetically enhanced to be
able to deal with viruses or other
[SPEAKER_06]: pathogens that that exist in the
environment Rob what's your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the GMO potential with with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Think it's all fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's the future obviously how far
down the road the future Manifest is
[SPEAKER_02]: another story but like Ryan's been saying
we really need to straighten out the
[SPEAKER_02]: genome and Before we start doing too many
complicated things not just looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: triploids which just multiply the existing
genome but understanding the genome better
[SPEAKER_02]: through sequencing and before we start
Messing around specific parts of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know what those specific parts
are and what they control One of my I Like
[SPEAKER_02]: how Ryan has said that basically CRISPR he
just lumps them with the other biotech
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques And I think as far as as where
we are with cannabis, that's appropriate I
[SPEAKER_02]: have a question on my own about CRISPR
what I've learned about it is it seems to
[SPEAKER_02]: be an excellent way to locate and negate
as in snippet out of the genome a
[SPEAKER_02]: particular DNA Combination which could be
a gene for a specific trait But I've not
[SPEAKER_02]: seen much evidence for what everybody
dreams about the CRISPR can be used to not
[SPEAKER_02]: just edit by deletion but edit by
substitution of another gene combination
[SPEAKER_02]: so where is CRISPR with other plants at In
terms of that as CRISPR is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: inserted gene or Just deleted gene.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you can totally do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like for example, you can insert purple
into a plant line Right and even have it
[SPEAKER_06]: expressed under under specific conditions
But yeah, you could take a white flower
[SPEAKER_06]: and make the flower purple with inserting
one gene It's like the way describe it Rob
[SPEAKER_06]: is it's kind of like a Like a jig is for
for carpentry, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like You know it say you're cutting a
table you put a jig on your table and then
[SPEAKER_06]: you can cut out a very specific of the
table and take another piece and cut it
[SPEAKER_06]: back in Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the CRISPR what you're talking
about the least deletions or what's called
[SPEAKER_06]: a loss of function mutation You you can
disrupt even just a couple of base pairs
[SPEAKER_06]: or you might cut out like three or ten or
twenty base pairs and that that's enough
[SPEAKER_06]: to destroy the gene The other thing that
you can do with CRISPR is you can cut in a
[SPEAKER_06]: different variant, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a different genetic variant that that
you know, so if you had for example,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know and in in say we're talking about
eye colors and humans if you're right at
[SPEAKER_06]: the beginning of the cell, you know,
you can take out a mutant blue-eyed gene
[SPEAKER_06]: version and cut back in a version that was
Pigmented, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say, you know a human example for a
You know, we're talking about plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's really yeah Yeah, but I mean it's
it's kind of what we're talking about with
[SPEAKER_06]: plants too I mean if the whiteness of a
petal was the result of a lost Anthocyanin
[SPEAKER_06]: gene or a mutated Anthocyanin gene My
point is Rob is that you cut back in a
[SPEAKER_06]: functional copy of that gene, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: the thing about CRISPR is it's like it's
really tied with Tissue culture because it
[SPEAKER_06]: happens on a single cellular level like
we're not talking CRISPR take a plant and
[SPEAKER_06]: dip it in in CRISPR juice and all of a
sudden it starts growing you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like these changes have to happen at a
genetic level and Those changes have to be
[SPEAKER_06]: consistent and true for every cell that
grow that every cell line that grows out
[SPEAKER_06]: of the mutated or the the CRISPR cell if
you will right and so it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_06]: two-step process where You're making these
is on a very small group of cells That all
[SPEAKER_06]: incorporate that trait and then when those
cells grow and then then you have to grow
[SPEAKER_06]: those cells into a full plant Right and
once it's in the plant you can breed it
[SPEAKER_06]: like any other trait, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not something that we keep doing on
but you keep doing You know, you have to
[SPEAKER_06]: keep going over and over again,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: once once you've CRISPR to trait into a
cell line or a plant you can then pass
[SPEAKER_06]: that trait through Using traditional
breeding methods.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure Mojave, what's what's your take is
you've got such a interesting kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: upbringing, you know your
second-generation Californian grower Now
[SPEAKER_05]: we're starting to talk about almost it's
almost like it's Silicon Valley where to
[SPEAKER_05]: move into Santa Cruz County Which I
actually technically they've been doing
[SPEAKER_05]: for a while now But you have this kind of
like Elon Musk technology here Which is
[SPEAKER_05]: very different than kind of on the core
fundamental beliefs of that you were
[SPEAKER_05]: raised on and a lot of your breeding
approaches I ethically I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: there's anything wrong with it if it's
done responsibly but I think that We're
[SPEAKER_03]: just a long ways away as we've kind of
been highlighting throughout this
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation that traditional breeding
techniques are key to get to the starting
[SPEAKER_03]: point for for more advanced techniques,
you know, and I think that since We kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of skipped over that process.
[SPEAKER_03]: We you know it we have to pick we have to
Select the plants that we want to improve
[SPEAKER_03]: first, you know the CRISPR, you know If
we're if we're editing in a single trait
[SPEAKER_03]: we want a variety that's close to that
trait that we're trying to edit in right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to take a small leafy
variety and Turn it into a tall chunky
[SPEAKER_03]: variety, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to we want to get as close as
possible and I think that you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we we owe it to consumers cannabis the
environment everyone to kind of fully
[SPEAKER_03]: explore what was already there,
you know, like I kind of like compare it
[SPEAKER_03]: to There was this book and documentary a
few years ago called the journey of man
[SPEAKER_03]: and We it was a project where we're trying
to collect genetic information from those
[SPEAKER_03]: many isolated populations around the world
And kind of the what came out of that is
[SPEAKER_03]: that that happened at just the right time
had it happened ten years later all those
[SPEAKER_03]: populations would have intermingled and We
wouldn't have had the information that we
[SPEAKER_03]: knew about the human genome or it would
have been a lot harder to parse out how
[SPEAKER_03]: the story of how Mankind came out of
Africa and spread into all these
[SPEAKER_03]: different, you know populations around the
world and I think it's similar with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis that you know, we You know,
we were isolated for so long Just
[SPEAKER_03]: geographically and then we were forced
into isolation through prohibition and
[SPEAKER_03]: then we all came out of that kind of
racing towards this new modern cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry But we skipped over this this
slower more progressive stage of kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: going through all these different
populations to see what value that they
[SPEAKER_03]: had and I think Is is is important
especially for the traditional farmer,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know who doesn't have access to a lot
of these tools what even for the People
[SPEAKER_06]: you have the tools it's important to do
those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about like Percent of us
might believe it was a Caucasian man that
[SPEAKER_06]: was first sequence, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's like great.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got one genome full genome of one white
guy, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what does that really tell us about
the genetic variation across the species
[SPEAKER_06]: not a hell of a lot Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So eventually if you know and it's
sequencing was really damn expensive to do
[SPEAKER_06]: it at that back then but now we can
sequence Genomes really quickly and for
[SPEAKER_06]: not very much money.
[SPEAKER_06]: So It became about doing what was called
the thousand genomes project right where
[SPEAKER_06]: we sequence Genomes from a thousand
different people men and women of all
[SPEAKER_06]: different colors and genetic backgrounds
from all over the planet and that way you
[SPEAKER_06]: can look at any given gene and look for
the variation within those genes and you
[SPEAKER_06]: know, even a thousand genomes you're not
going to capture the breadth of the
[SPEAKER_06]: genetic variation within the species like
really you need ten thousand or a hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: thousand of Genomes and and even as you
sequence more like you're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: randomly find new mutations, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: but Essentially those alleles or those
genetic variants or snips There's a
[SPEAKER_06]: catalog of them right within the species
like there's a set of alleles That the
[SPEAKER_06]: species produces and we don't know what
those sets are we're starting to learn
[SPEAKER_06]: about it with some of the work that a
candomire did with You know the genetic
[SPEAKER_06]: variants at the THCS synth is but that
kind of variation that you see in the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid production Genes I'm willing
to bet, you know anything that those that
[SPEAKER_06]: type of variation is seen Almost all the
way across the genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like you might not see it in some very
important housekeeping Genes that have to
[SPEAKER_06]: do with like cellular division or
whatever, you know Photosynthesis some of
[SPEAKER_06]: those things are more more highly
conserved but every other trait you're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to see a level of genetic variation
and Really what sequencing is going to
[SPEAKER_06]: allow us to do is make a catalog of that
variation at every genetic locus or every
[SPEAKER_06]: genetic spot on the chromosome and Once we
understand what those variants are and
[SPEAKER_06]: what they what they confer to the plant or
or to the biological pathways of the plant
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we're going to be able to put those
things together or we assemble those
[SPEAKER_06]: things using breeding techniques in a
different way To really create optimized
[SPEAKER_06]: plants, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But we got a lot of discovery to go to get
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Think the good thing with most cannabis
breeders is they seem to have a decent
[SPEAKER_05]: level of patience Because yeah,
we've got to kind of wait for things to
[SPEAKER_05]: catch up a bit before before we're too
destructive this last question will be for
[SPEAKER_05]: you Ryan to kind of represent speak on
behalf of Canada and then Mojave if you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't mind it kind of answering on behalf
of you know, California and kind of the
[SPEAKER_05]: general states the question is Ryan for
you should license producers be investing
[SPEAKER_05]: in in-house plant breeding or maybe is
this something that should be?
[SPEAKER_05]: Outsourcing to like a micro license as an
example Tough to do in a micro license you
[SPEAKER_06]: probably do some screening but like real
breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know You can really grow a
thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I Think we're gonna see both types like
said that company from Israel and set up
[SPEAKER_06]: shop down in San Diego I think they're
called can breed they're gonna cater to a
[SPEAKER_06]: larger clientele Probably more corporate I
think it really just depends on the size
[SPEAKER_06]: of the company Genetic innovation is
important but you know most wineries are
[SPEAKER_06]: growing the same old wine grapes But they
have been for you know hundreds of years
[SPEAKER_06]: And just taking pride in doing that one
type and doing it really well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that we'll probably see people
that They figure out a cultivar that
[SPEAKER_06]: really works for them and they like and
they produce really well and it's received
[SPEAKER_06]: really well consistently on the
marketplace and they'll specialize in that
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe play around with a little bit,
but I think that like, you know any any
[SPEAKER_06]: Square foot that you dedicate to R&D is
not a square foot that you're pretty no,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's expensive It's expensive to from a
capex standpoint, you know when you look
[SPEAKER_05]: at it and there's obviously risk if you
kind of got pollen in the space and and
[SPEAKER_06]: and and and then you start talking about
like I mean, you know the amount of cost
[SPEAKER_06]: that it takes to just do the chemical
analysis just the chemical analysis right
[SPEAKER_06]: or for even for just Beans and cabin I'd
you're not even looking at some of these
[SPEAKER_06]: other volatile compounds or at least maybe
you are doing volatile But you're not
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at oil content or root,
you know chemicals or resistances or
[SPEAKER_06]: chemicals involved resistance I mean it
adds up really really really quickly like
[SPEAKER_06]: if you're you know Even if you're doing it
in-house and you can get like a hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: dollar retail test down to thirty dollars
cost If you're on a thousand plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's 30 grand, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so well, that's you know, it's a it's
a specific business model and it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: specific type that's gonna understand
putting that kind of money into R&D leads
[SPEAKER_06]: to Like a difference in the marketplace
that gets you an ROI right so I think see
[SPEAKER_06]: people That like I think we'll see segment
as breeding companies and there'll be some
[SPEAKER_06]: small breeders Kind of the way there are
today and then there'll be the Syngenta
[SPEAKER_06]: Big-time bears that are doing it big ag
style with lots of markers is the
[SPEAKER_06]: selection lots of money and public money
It's interesting Genetics don't derive
[SPEAKER_05]: evaluation as much in cannabis as they do
in other traditional crops You know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we start talking about Syngenta and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the genetics are everything They
drive a lot of the evaluation for whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the infrastructure or the sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like oh my genetic portfolio It's
a tricky one to put a financial number to
[SPEAKER_06]: the value of it for a lot of these
Industries so young dude that everybody's
[SPEAKER_06]: like they're looking at your clothes nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's inside, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's that that whole expression is
you know, it's what's inside that counts.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not what's on the cover, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and there's two and there's you
can't build an industry you Can't build a
[SPEAKER_06]: multi-billion dollar ag industry on plants
that have been selected by like 20 year
[SPEAKER_06]: olds and closets Like that's just not the
way it works You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not saying that the 20 year olds
and bosses didn't do a decent job in some
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did there was there There are like a
few What I'll call breeding wins,
[SPEAKER_06]: but like the amount of breeding losses
that had to like pile up for win losses,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like the ratio is way out of
whack and I think that as we start
[SPEAKER_06]: treating cannabis as like a true scaled ag
product You know and again also
[SPEAKER_06]: understanding that it's not a widget like
you're not just trying to pump out a
[SPEAKER_06]: million widgets, right like These are
experiences that are that are touching
[SPEAKER_06]: people, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know Yeah, I just add that you
know, it's great to for for groups to have
[SPEAKER_03]: proprietary cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's all good, but It's not easy
and to try to build a brand around a
[SPEAKER_03]: unique cultivars challenging when people
circulate through so many different
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars Throughout the years,
you know, there's there's there's only
[SPEAKER_03]: been a few companies have been really
successful Doing that but I think it just
[SPEAKER_03]: like Ryan's point on grapes We have to
land somewhere eventually that we hope
[SPEAKER_03]: through all this this this breeding effort
collectively we get to an endgame which is
[SPEAKER_03]: particular varieties that are suited for
specific use in specific regions under
[SPEAKER_03]: specific cultivation strategies and then
we all Utilize those varieties as a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's the only way to make the
market really function for the supply
[SPEAKER_03]: chain to really function For the consumers
to really understand what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Properties they're getting out of their
their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't just expect them We can't have
two three four five thousand different
[SPEAKER_03]: choices and for the hundreds of thousands
and millions of consumers just to navigate
[SPEAKER_03]: through that to select the varieties that
work best for them we collectively have as
[SPEAKER_03]: an industry have to develop the pinot noir
the Cabernet the Merlot the San Giovese
[SPEAKER_03]: the the cab franc that what all the
different all the different varieties I
[SPEAKER_03]: picked only red there, but that's my own
anyway Mike So we have to get there and
[SPEAKER_03]: once we get there then you know,
there's there's a lot of variety
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement that can happen I mean,
there's thousands of different clones of
[SPEAKER_03]: pinot noir that are available,
you know, but they're all They're all
[SPEAKER_03]: available, you know, and they're all there
your your selection for what variety you
[SPEAKER_03]: grow tends to come from You know an
already established robust industry that
[SPEAKER_03]: knows that this particular clone grows
well and this region of this particular
[SPEAKER_03]: Appalachian so it's you know, we have to
get there first and I think that's a big
[SPEAKER_03]: challenge and right now we're so obsessed
I mean I hear this obsession with
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary owners here in California They
have to constantly pump out the new new
[SPEAKER_03]: because the consumer comes in there
wanting this quest they're on this quest
[SPEAKER_03]: to find something new Partially,
I think because they never land on
[SPEAKER_03]: something that works for them the right
way or they're not guided towards the
[SPEAKER_03]: right choice But we have to make that
selection for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't expect the market to evolve based
off of this massive diversity this this
[SPEAKER_03]: this paradox of choice, you know,
but everyone thinks it's really it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: fascination right now to experience all
that cannabis can be but in order for the
[SPEAKER_03]: market to mature we kind of have to land
on certain areas so that that's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be breeding and You know more than
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be you know, kind of what
production techniques work best You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then hopefully we get there and then
consumers can can make the right choices
[SPEAKER_03]: and the market can mature but But right
now in California, it's just a mess
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's you know hundreds and
hundreds of different cultivars that all
[SPEAKER_03]: have a very similar effect But consumers
are excited at the hunt, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they go from from dispensary to dispensary
and there's never Two menus that look
[SPEAKER_03]: alike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's really challenging for the
grower, you know Because especially at
[SPEAKER_05]: scale to be able to make those changes
based off of market demand and oftentimes
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear growers, you know after then
growing for three or five years
[SPEAKER_05]: commercially in California say I should
have just grown Oji Kush this whole time
[SPEAKER_05]: You know or some kind of statement like
that because it's a it's a classic thing
[SPEAKER_05]: It was difficult for them to stay on the
edge or on the cusp of you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: what that new new is Well, it's actually
impossible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean no one Person could constantly be
at the edge plant breeding doesn't
[SPEAKER_06]: progress at that rate You know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes three months to grow to to make a
seed, you know, it was Sorry for we used
[SPEAKER_06]: to make a seed but another three call it
to grow that seed if everybody wants
[SPEAKER_06]: something new in eight months There's just
not enough time to select the new plant
[SPEAKER_06]: test it bulk it up into a production
system You know, it's like that that rate
[SPEAKER_06]: of desire for something New it's like at
some point it has to be tempered in
[SPEAKER_06]: reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree Well, as always, this is a
never-ending conversation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're kind of exceeded our time here I I
learned a ton today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Sega for hosting And then I'm
going to turn it over to Ian Davidson with
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple closing notes here All right,
thanks everybody for joining If you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: any follow-up questions that we weren't
able to get to you've got contact
[SPEAKER_01]: information here for each of our panelists
Thank you guys all very much for joining
[SPEAKER_01]: on the panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everyone for joining out there in
cyberspace We'll be announcing some future
[SPEAKER_01]: growth talks very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please stay tuned and again if you have
any topics you'd like us to Consider for
[SPEAKER_01]: the future talks, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know Yeah, please be in touch and
have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk to you all soon You
