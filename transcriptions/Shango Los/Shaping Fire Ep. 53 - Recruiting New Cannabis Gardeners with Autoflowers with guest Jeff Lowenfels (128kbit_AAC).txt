[SPEAKER_03]: It was the summer of 2017 when I first
experienced auto flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was standing in the fields with Seth and
Eric Crawford of Oregon CBD Seeds looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at gorgeous and fabulously smelling acres
and acres of cannabis that was ready to
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the beginning of September.
[SPEAKER_03]: My regular plants at home had another six
weeks left to flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six weeks that would leave me in the face
of October rains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these fields in front of me were
finished and ready to be cut and dried.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is when I first understood the
potential for auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then in the summer of 2018 I grew my first
auto flower seeds and spent the entire run
[SPEAKER_03]: realizing the major impact that these
seeds were going to have on home growing
[SPEAKER_03]: and the industry as a whole over the next
10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally solid cultivars of auto flowers
were available and I knew that home
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, patients and some commercial
growers were going to be astonished when
[SPEAKER_03]: they had a chance to trial them.
[SPEAKER_03]: By September my auto flowers were out of
the ground, dried and in jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well ahead of the rains.
[SPEAKER_03]: My regular photo period seeds were in the
greenhouse still and preparing for the
[SPEAKER_03]: harsh October cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then at Emerald Cup last year I found
myself standing with Jeff Lowenfels
[SPEAKER_03]: chatting about how I thought autos were
going to change the face of home grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jeff smiled and said that he agreed
and that in fact as a gardening calmness
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer for over 40 years he saw auto
flowers as the new tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That these new auto flower varieties were
the threshold moment where cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation made the crossover to regular
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that Jeff had written a book about
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff and I each looked at each other like
we shared a secret that was going to
[SPEAKER_03]: excite everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went home and programmed an entire year
of auto flower content for 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: A shaping fire live on auto flowers at
Cultivation Classic.
[SPEAKER_03]: A Vimeo meeting focused on auto flowers
for cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: A standing room only presentation on auto
flowers I did at Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a slew of videos helping shine some
light on auto flower breeders and to get
[SPEAKER_03]: the message out that auto flowers had
grown up.
[SPEAKER_03]: This episode of shaping fire is the last
of the auto flowering program I put
[SPEAKER_03]: together for 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's beautiful because it brings me
full circle to where I started this cycle
[SPEAKER_03]: with Jeff.

[SPEAKER_03]: Today my guest is gardening columnist and
Lord of the roots, Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff has been an award winning gardening
columnist for over 40 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a recovering attorney who fell in
love with plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is author of the seminal teaming series
of teaming with microbes, teaming with
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients, and teaming with fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: His new book DIY auto flowering cannabis
an easy way to grow your own comes out
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today Jeff and I are going to talk about
how auto flowers are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: revolutionize home grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh it's absolutely fantastic here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been getting a lot of rain here
which concerns everybody who's growing in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gotten three days of sun so
everybody's sitting in a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: false hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah yeah well hopefully hopefully it'll
come true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah totally and then actually that'll
play into today's topic really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So congratulations on your new book out
today on auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a such a departure from what I
normally do but it was it was just one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those things I just felt I had to do and
so it's out today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to get it at
bookstores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's hard to say what the
distribution is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cannabis book and the course
there's still that stigma you know but but
[SPEAKER_01]: people people who've taken a look at this
tell me that maybe this book's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: help lift that stigma a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we hope so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well as someone who's already had an
opportunity to read it I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it not only will increase or
decrease the stigma but increase the
[SPEAKER_03]: number of people dabbling in cannabis
which is which is really fun right because
[SPEAKER_03]: up to this point you've had to have a
certain amount of chutzpah to get into
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and to grow it either because it
was illegal and you're going to have to go
[SPEAKER_03]: through all this hiding stuff or if it was
legal in your state to grow a few plants
[SPEAKER_03]: you had to feel especially confident in I
don't know in your right in your right to
[SPEAKER_03]: do that right because even though
something might be legal to grow you still
[SPEAKER_03]: might get shamed by your family or
neighbors or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think your your book helps create
support for those people who just want to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's really the genesis of
the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you know me I'm so-called Lord of
the Roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I write books about soil and the science
behind how things grow organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden here's a book on auto
flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I ought to mention the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a DIY auto flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: A new way to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so why did I write this book.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it was sort of one of these crazy
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't seem to be in character.
[SPEAKER_01]: What people don't know is that I also
write a garden column and I was invited to
[SPEAKER_01]: speak at the Garden Writers of America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gosh it must have been six or seven
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the first talk on cannabis that
this organization's had.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the radio people the TV people
and newspaper magazine people et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I gave this talk about how I
thought cannabis was the next tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the talk was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people walked away with a lot of
excitement about CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it didn't have the impact that I that
I was hoping it would have because I
[SPEAKER_01]: really I really think that cannabis is a
fun plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it is a fun plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who's tried it knows it's a fun
plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a little challenging but it's a
great plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a gardener and you like
horticulture this is a terrific plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well you know one of the reasons it didn't
take off as a subject is because these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They require a tremendous amount of space
to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most gardeners don't have a lot of
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in a condo.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know they have a small vegetable
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you say when you say these plants you
mean traditional cannabis plants right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that so that's why one of the reasons
why I don't think garden writers took to
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second reason is is that these plants
require a photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words as anybody who's grown
these plants know they have to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to have more than 12 hours of
darkness before they will begin to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that causes very little problem in
lots of places but in many places
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly northern hemisphere places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess if you're on the south of the
southern hemisphere places you don't you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get that period of darkness until
things begin to get very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you live in Anchorage Alaska on
September 21st when we have 12 hours of
[SPEAKER_01]: daylight and 12 hours of darkness we also
usually have a frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well you know it takes another six or
seven weeks for that plant to flower and
[SPEAKER_01]: those flowers to develop etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very hard to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I became convinced that's why it
wasn't taking off in states where it was
[SPEAKER_01]: legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lo and behold my good friend Tom Alexander
the very same guy who told me about the
[SPEAKER_01]: the fungus protecting a tomato root from a
nematode trying to attack it which started
[SPEAKER_01]: my whole adventure into the soil food web
and began the whole series of books and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else shows me some plants that
he's growing called auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you know we all know about auto flower
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard about them before.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were discovered you know and bred and
finally in around 1970 or so people
[SPEAKER_01]: started to release these little things
called lowrider plants and they were cute
[SPEAKER_01]: little things and they didn't have a photo
period like the big guys did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could grow them in little six inch
pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was sort of exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the but the cannabis that they produce
was low in THC and very the plants were
[SPEAKER_01]: small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cute novelty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know a lot of fun to show people but
not not something really that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: grow to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast forward to when Tom showed me these
auto flowers about five or six years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were decent sized tomato sized plants
and they were without question producing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that was usable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know I started to grow them and
fool around with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lo and behold every time you grew one
it was a better plant because the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: on these things has has just multiplied
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of interests in the in getting
a plant that is available for everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: there's been a tremendous amount of work
put into producing seeds that produce
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that meet all the requirements you
would want to have for growing this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: as a hobby plant home gardener not a
cannabis producer but a home gardener your
[SPEAKER_01]: aunt your uncle your mother you know your
brother and sister who don't like cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: but love to grow tomatoes and cucumbers
and zucchinis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: These auto flowers now are at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just because you know I've got a
lot of a lot of friends who I think would
[SPEAKER_01]: really love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sat down and wrote a book and it's not
the same kind of book as the teaming book
[SPEAKER_01]: is very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a commercial grower this is not
a book for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a book for Uncle Bob and Aunt
Sally at Christmas time so that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: learn about cannabis and then learn about
auto flowering cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities that it presents.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can certainly imagine that this book is
going to be under a lot of Christmas trees
[SPEAKER_03]: this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you were talking about you talk
your your presentation a few years back at
[SPEAKER_03]: the Gardner's Association you said that
you know it wasn't immediately picked up
[SPEAKER_03]: and embraced by the writers and other
media people are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you said primarily you thought because
of the size of cannabis plants and of
[SPEAKER_03]: course it was the plant itself was still
very much in legal prohibition transition
[SPEAKER_03]: at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my question for you is very
specifically because you know that your
[SPEAKER_03]: your your whole your book is all about
normalizing cannabis gardening.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as somebody who's been writing a
garden column for over 40 years and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know you've won awards and you're very
successful at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it about gardening column this
which causes them to have to kind of err
[SPEAKER_03]: on the conservative side.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I don't really I don't know the
answer to it but but I bet you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fear and it's fear of your publisher
which is pretty easy to overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just go ask your publisher whether
it's OK for you to write about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's fear of of of your readership
turning their back on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know a lot of times when I think about
my my core readership I think you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: always and I really shouldn't be saying
this but I'm going to say you know me I
[SPEAKER_01]: think you know the little old lady in
tennis sneakers and she's somebody who
[SPEAKER_01]: wants wants me to be writing about
cannabis or should I be writing about
[SPEAKER_01]: marigolds and you know how to harvest your
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so it's fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course and then of course there's
that there's that that possibility you
[SPEAKER_01]: know that that that you say something that
somehow gets you in trouble with the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know either it's illegal in your state
or you you make a suggestion you know
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow it doesn't fit with the
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so for example in Washington state it's
against the I think it's still against the
[SPEAKER_01]: law.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell me to to know maybe it's not
there's no there's no homegrown here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah no homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in New York state when they were
trying to pass you know Governor Cuomo got
[SPEAKER_01]: convinced by boy I'm going to get you know
slammed it on this one you know by mad men
[SPEAKER_01]: to not let people grow their own plants
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know there's there is there's this
stigma about and I'm going to say the word
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate it marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when you hear the word marijuana
you know you're talking to somebody that
[SPEAKER_01]: has a stigma about cannabis because it's a
disgusting word from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a you know it's like putting a statue
up to Harry Anselinger who used that word
[SPEAKER_01]: to turn the public against this drug and
this medicine and this wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah there's a big stigma there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I remember when I wrote my first
column on cannabis I always just tell
[SPEAKER_01]: people when you read my columns if I'm
writing about tomatoes you can apply that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can apply that knowledge to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but all of a sudden it was fully
legalized in Alaska and it's been legal
[SPEAKER_01]: here since 1975 in the privacy of your
home but it became fully legalized medical
[SPEAKER_01]: and recreational and I wrote a column and
I asked my readers are you going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: upset about this and boy oh boy people
were just thrilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just thrilled about it because
you know I think deep down in you can be
[SPEAKER_01]: you can be pro-Trump anti-Trump you could
be pro you know any one of the Democratic
[SPEAKER_01]: candidates whatever deep down in all of us
understand that the ability to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow a plant is a basic human right and
they've taken it away from us in so many
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: In so many places and and we want it back
and we're getting it back and now we have
[SPEAKER_01]: to now we have to use it properly and so
anyway that's sort of a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of buck stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so let's talk about the little grandma
in the tennis sneakers that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: referring to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so so clearly those of us in the
cannabis scene we love the idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: promotion of cannabis because in most
cases it's our favorite plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then but but but your audience that
you're speaking to this time with your
[SPEAKER_03]: book your your audience are people who
primarily love gardening and the love of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis may be new to them either because
they're you they they're spending a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: money on topicals and they want to make
their own or they've fallen in love with
[SPEAKER_03]: tinctures or or hell maybe they've just
decided that they in their you know
[SPEAKER_03]: they've gotten over the taboo and they
love puffing in their home whatever the
[SPEAKER_03]: reason you're speaking to this new
audience of of cannabis enthusiasts and I
[SPEAKER_03]: would think that what you're hearing from
them about why they're excited about the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant is often different about what you
hear from cannabis people about why
[SPEAKER_03]: they're excited about the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm curious what what kind of
unique things are you hearing from
[SPEAKER_03]: gardeners about your introduction of
cannabis and auto flowers that is
[SPEAKER_03]: different than what you're getting from
growers stoners like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well first of all I've sort of tested this
over the you know I don't I don't go out
[SPEAKER_01]: and just write a book willy-nilly I got to
do a little better little bit of research
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and then I make the rest of the
stuff up but just kidding of course but
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I so I talked to gardeners in the
Anchorage area right where I live and
[SPEAKER_01]: about the fact that it was legal and now
they could grow plants and and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: all trying to grow regular regular plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens with gardeners as we get
bored you know it's you can grow a tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: year in and year out and get great
tomatoes it's boring it's too easy and so
[SPEAKER_01]: what we look for are new things to grow
let's start with the new techniques every
[SPEAKER_01]: now and then come along but what we really
look for are new things to grow and you
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've talked about this before I
remember and maybe you're old enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: remember when the snap pea was introduced
to the American gardener oh my god people
[SPEAKER_01]: went nuts you know and and snap peas are
now duro gore you grow snap peas in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden they're easy to grow blah blah blah
it tastes great you can use them stir-fry
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeah so so people grow snap peas you
know tomatoes people bored with tomatoes
[SPEAKER_01]: got into heirlooms why did they get into
heirlooms because it was different it was
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting it was it was a way to introduce
new plants to your to your palate and and
[SPEAKER_01]: and so all of a sudden you get legalized
cannabis and people who are really into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening who can get their hands on
either a clone or seed they grow a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and whether that whether they're
successful in getting a harvest or not
[SPEAKER_01]: they are excited about growing that
cannabis plant all the way through to
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever they get because for the true
gardener it's not the harvest it's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato it's not the marigold flower you
know that that you that makes gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: terrific it's the process you know it's
it's it's watching the plant grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: develop and and it's the beauty of
understanding you know that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: cells being added because you because
there are microbes down in the soil that
[SPEAKER_01]: are feed you know there's a beauty to it
all that's that that transcends just that
[SPEAKER_01]: one moment where you pick the tomato you
know or you take the tomato over to your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbor and brag about it you know it's
the process of growing that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening fun and and cannabis is a fun
plant to grow it's it's it's got a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: distinct stages and when you when you then
go to an auto flowering plant the fun
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes compressed into the same length of
time that it takes to grow a tomato the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant itself is small you can grow it in a
five gallon bucket you watch it go
[SPEAKER_01]: literally from seed to harvest in seven to
nine weeks it flowers or it shows whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be a male or female oh now
isn't that incredible I never get a phone
[SPEAKER_01]: call and then all of a sudden you end up
with a plant that you can't take your eyes
[SPEAKER_01]: off of because it's growing new leaves
every day it's getting bigger literally
[SPEAKER_01]: every day I I almost compare it to growing
a giant pumpkin they put on 40 pounds a
[SPEAKER_01]: night 40 pounds a night well when you
watch an auto flowering cannabis grow you
[SPEAKER_01]: go to bed you get up the next morning and
it's bigger noticeably so measurably so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's an exciting thing to have happen
and then you add on to that what you and I
[SPEAKER_01]: know that is that that this isn't just one
kind of auto flower cannabis plant there's
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plants that definitely do all
sorts of things like CBD production or THC
[SPEAKER_01]: production you can get different colors
you can expose them to cooler temperatures
[SPEAKER_01]: they turn purple you know there they can
become a landscape plant you can put them
[SPEAKER_01]: around your you know your yard your
walkways you know on your deck they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: terrific plant on top of being a cannabis
plant so wow it made for a great subject
[SPEAKER_03]: book fantastic well how about this Jeff
why don't we address that that call coming
[SPEAKER_03]: in on your side and take a short break
right now we'll be right back you're
[SPEAKER_03]: listening to shaping fire and my guest
today is Lord of the roots Jeff Lowenfels
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivators who grow in living soil are
very particular on what inputs they use in
[SPEAKER_03]: their soil they educate themselves and
painstakingly create compost and nutritive
[SPEAKER_03]: teas to create thriving soils that will
produce the very best expression of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis plant many living soil farmers
now believe that over time seeds become
[SPEAKER_03]: acclimated to the kind of substrate they
are grown in for example a seed that was
[SPEAKER_03]: bred in synthetic fertilizers may not
immediately know what to do in a living
[SPEAKER_03]: soil environment slowing their growth and
decreasing yield the regenerative seed
[SPEAKER_03]: cooperative is a different kind of seed
bank the regenerative seed cooperative
[SPEAKER_03]: only provide cannabis seeds that were bred
in living soil and using probiotic growing
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques that way when you germinate in
soil the seeds genetics will recognize the
[SPEAKER_03]: environment and immediately start
interacting with microbes and fungal
[SPEAKER_03]: networks these seeds are described as bio
intelligent the number of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders participating in the regenerative
seed cooperative is rapidly increasing
[SPEAKER_03]: already signed on are bamboos stock and
bean pacific northwest roots los gardens
[SPEAKER_03]: dragonfly earth medicine ital foundation
bob hemp hills cricket and cicada dutch
[SPEAKER_03]: blooms heartrock mountain farms pride of
lion sebring seeds and mount baker highway
[SPEAKER_03]: with more being added every month these
seeds are regulars auto flowers and hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties a significant amount of the
profits go to cannabis seed preservation
[SPEAKER_03]: projects available to everyone do you want
to take every advantage that you can when
[SPEAKER_03]: growing in beautiful healthy soil then
consider buying your seeds from the
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative seed cooperative at
regenerative seeds dot com that's
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative seeds dot com did you know
that shaping fire has a fabulous youtube
[SPEAKER_03]: channel with content not found on the
podcast when i attend conventions or speak
[SPEAKER_03]: or moderate panels i always record them
and bring the content home for you to
[SPEAKER_03]: watch the shango los youtube channel it
has world-class speakers including kevin

lowenfels on the soil food web there are
[SPEAKER_03]: several presentations from dr ethan russo
on terpenes and the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_03]: and even my own presentation on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business even though the risks are so high

[SPEAKER_03]: newsletter welcome back you're listening
to shaping fire i'm your host shango los
[SPEAKER_03]: and our guest this week is gardening
author jeff lowenfels so during the first
[SPEAKER_03]: set we talked a lot about your motivations
for the book and who the book is for and
[SPEAKER_03]: and actually some really pretty poetic
stuff about the the enjoyment of gardening
[SPEAKER_03]: that we all share um so sorry about that
no no that's good i think that's good and
[SPEAKER_03]: i think that really speaks to the heart of
your book right um this book really is for
[SPEAKER_03]: people who are in love with plants
generally and to kind of encourage people
[SPEAKER_01]: who are in about where they came from is
uh because these things grew in these
[SPEAKER_01]: little rubbly terrible soily areas uh and
what he noticed about him and the and what
[SPEAKER_01]: really caught his attention was that
unlike regular cannabis these particular
[SPEAKER_01]: plants bloomed before uh the other ones
did way before the other ones did and and
[SPEAKER_01]: when he did his research he discovered
that in fact they were not influenced by a
[SPEAKER_01]: photo period in other words the the
triggering event for flowering uh is is
[SPEAKER_01]: increased darkness beyond 12 hours they
were bloomed because of genetics so it
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't matter what the daylight was or the
darkness these things bloomed in set a set
[SPEAKER_01]: period apparently they came from uh the
they were escapees from hemp plantations
[SPEAKER_01]: and uh you know they they escaped and
because of evolution they they you know
[SPEAKER_01]: they figured out that if they didn't seed
right away uh they they before the frost
[SPEAKER_01]: they weren't going to make it and so so
they they bred into themselves this
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic uh disposition to flower as
opposed to having the normal photo period
[SPEAKER_01]: uh flowering so so that happened uh uh you
know and again it was it was of interest
[SPEAKER_01]: but really nobody could breed them uh to
to do anything that made any sense and and
[SPEAKER_01]: it really wasn't until the 1970s when a
bunch of stoner guys frankly uh you know
[SPEAKER_01]: started fooling around with them 60s i
guess obviously uh and and uh i think i
[SPEAKER_01]: think when they came out in 1971 it was a
little bit early uh they were just they
[SPEAKER_01]: were just a novelty plant nobody ever
thought they were going to be any good um
[SPEAKER_01]: now uh again you know you know cannabis
growers they like to breed things and so
[SPEAKER_01]: so people continually bred them uh not
only with uh each other uh with but with
[SPEAKER_01]: their cousins the bigger sativas and
indicas but also different ruderalis
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can find ruderalis all around
the world it turns out so uh the
[SPEAKER_01]: particular ruderalis that is in theory the
one used for the lowrider uh is said to
[SPEAKER_01]: have come from either finland or mexico
which i found to be shocking because i
[SPEAKER_01]: thought oh there must be in some they must
be in a cold climate but no they're
[SPEAKER_01]: ruderalis in mexico they're ruderalis in
alaska they're ruderalis all over so um uh
[SPEAKER_01]: you breed them with different different
ruderalis and you breed them with
[SPEAKER_01]: different different uh bigger parents uh
and you end up with different kinds of of
[SPEAKER_03]: auto flowering cannabis plants one of the
things that you mentioned in your your
[SPEAKER_03]: live presentation about autos is is how uh
ruderalis are are the really only cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: variety that really thrives in really
crappy low nutrient environments and i
[SPEAKER_03]: find that really interesting because um
not only does it show the the vigor to
[SPEAKER_03]: live that are in these genetics um but you
also then go and caution people to not
[SPEAKER_03]: feed them like they would a regular
cannabis plant will you break that out a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit for us sure uh they they do the the
the one hand one set of the parents do
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in in very poor conditions uh they
grow very quickly they've they've adapted
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to get what they need from a
soil food web perspective in other words
[SPEAKER_01]: they're actually they produce the right
stuff they get the right bacteria and
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi and they quickly they quickly take
up nutrients and they and they are capable
[SPEAKER_01]: of keeping a very rapid pace of of uh
growth by taking up their nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: without any help whatsoever from anybody
now you know we tend to forget that this
[SPEAKER_01]: is a plant that we call weed and the
reason we call it weed is twofold one it
[SPEAKER_01]: grows anywhere in theory and two it grows
quickly like a weed uh well auto flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is the weed of weeds it really
grows quickly and it can grow anywhere uh
[SPEAKER_01]: what i've discovered and i think other
growers as well is that if you feed these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants it messes them up uh at least at
least initially uh they they have
[SPEAKER_01]: everything they need in that seed if you
if you put them in decent soil living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: uh you're going to get a great plant if
you feed that soil all manner of nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: as people tend to do when they're growing
cannabis uh you you end up with a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's confused uh that that can't
adjust properly uh and and they burn
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly uh they grow spindly and you lose
you lose the essence of that great
[SPEAKER_01]: ruderalis uh that that makes this such an
easy plant to grow i think this is
[SPEAKER_03]: probably one of the reasons why so many uh
i guess growers who've been growing for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while um have yet more reasons that they
personally don't like auto flowers because
[SPEAKER_03]: you know people work long and hard to come
up with their recipe for growing and autos
[SPEAKER_03]: don't really fit most people's recipes
they they really do um uh enjoy benign
[SPEAKER_03]: neglect like in a perfect environment
you'd have a no-till pot that's already
[SPEAKER_03]: set up and you put your seed in there and
then you forget about it and then you come
[SPEAKER_03]: back when it's time to harvest and that
freaks people out yeah yeah it is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing uh and you can see one of the
reasons why it was developed i mean you
[SPEAKER_01]: know if you were if you were a a
clandestine grower you know you could grow
[SPEAKER_01]: these things under your under your stairs
without ever having to go in and look at
[SPEAKER_01]: them you know you put an automatic
watering system in you leave you leave the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights on for 24 hours holy crow you know
you don't have to do anything to them you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even have to give them darkness well
that that makes that makes for pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting uh you know uh times you think so
so so yeah so these plants really are so
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to grow that it does frustrate the
professional grower a little bit you know
[SPEAKER_01]: they turn their nose up at them they're
you know but by the same by the same token
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of professional growers use their
current system to grow these things and
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't do well and then they badmouth
the autoflower plant which i have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell listeners are now becoming a
normally used plant in many commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: grows both hemp i should say all hemp cbd
and thc in oregon the main reader of these
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds only sells now to commercial growers
and you know the the reason is is because
[SPEAKER_03]: they come out so uniform right i mean well
good seeds are right because that that is
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the challenges with autoflower
seeds at this point is you get a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: different phenos in one pack generally but
the people at the top of the autoflower
[SPEAKER_03]: game um you know this is not true for all
seeds the top the top seeds will all be
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly the same in uniform but i would
say that that is a very small fraction at
[SPEAKER_03]: the very top when most everybody i mean
this summer we popped a lot of autoflower
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds on vashon and we would get you know
three footers and five footers out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: same pack right yeah and i think i think
part of that has to do with the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: they are so easy to grow uh and so what
you've got are a lot of people who are who
[SPEAKER_01]: are buying seeds and then and then further
selling them on so you got middlemen
[SPEAKER_01]: selling seeds you know uh and and they
don't know what they are and really you
[SPEAKER_01]: know they haven't tested them etc etc now
you and i both know that that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that have perfected their seed
breeding programs and you can find most of
[SPEAKER_01]: these companies i don't think we want to
give too many names but you can find these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies by going on to the internet
autofloweringnetwork.com uh or is it
[SPEAKER_01]: autoflowering autoflowernet.com uh has a
whole bunch of discussion uh threads about
[SPEAKER_01]: seed companies and which ones are good and
which ones aren't and the companies
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves are represented there and and
so that is the one area i think needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: improve sort of chicken and egg uh i wrote
a book about about a plant that you might
[SPEAKER_01]: have difficulty getting seeds uh you know
at your local seed store yeah that's for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure and and for the record it's
autoflower.net um oh good yeah totally
[SPEAKER_03]: it's funny for being so simple it's really
easy to throw extra words in there right
[SPEAKER_01]: i've had that challenge myself but it is a
terrific site and if anybody has even the
[SPEAKER_01]: inkling of interest in these plants this
is the place to go after you buy the book
[SPEAKER_01]: because you will get all of the bud porn
that you're accustomed to uh all of the uh
[SPEAKER_01]: ranting and ravings uh of technique and
flushing not flushing that you're used to
[SPEAKER_01]: uh you know it's just but it's on auto
flowers and i gotta say that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: autoflower.net was formed because the auto
flower folks got harassed and laughed out
[SPEAKER_03]: of so many of the grower forums that they
just went and and did their own and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can still feel that because the community
is very kind and i actually find that all
[SPEAKER_03]: across the whole auto flower scene the
people who are growing them the people who
[SPEAKER_03]: are breeding the seeds you know the the
green rush really hasn't come to auto
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers yet and so people are very modest
and kind and uh you know there's jerks in
[SPEAKER_03]: every scene right but but overall i really
enjoy being a part of the auto flower
[SPEAKER_03]: scene um because it's um it's not as
cutthroat as some of the other parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry let me put it in the
vernacular of the book it's because people
[SPEAKER_01]: who grow auto flowers are gardeners and
gardeners share they share information
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll talk about it later on they share
food you know the gardeners share it's
[SPEAKER_01]: when you get into the commercial world and
you you know that you're and you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get competitive that you stop sharing and
you stop being a gardener and you start
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming a farmer which will you know well
maybe don't share quite as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners do but i think that's a hallmark
of gardening uh and and i'm hopeful that
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners who who are capable of growing
these plants and have seeds will share
[SPEAKER_01]: them and uh et cetera et cetera because
it's it's that's what gardeners do uh and
[SPEAKER_03]: this is perfectly right on so let's talk a
little bit about uh the growing of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and some of the uniquenesses that
come with growing a plant that grows so
[SPEAKER_03]: fast so right so i dropped in uh briefly
that that uh you know the plant loves to
[SPEAKER_03]: be um germinated in its soil because it's
got such a short life it doesn't like to
[SPEAKER_03]: be trans transplanted very much because
the uh the momentary stress actually takes
[SPEAKER_03]: a significant part of its of its lifetime
but i also said that it likes to be put
[SPEAKER_03]: into um a pot that's already been grown in
and has not been not fresh soil so what we
[SPEAKER_03]: think of as no-till and and what i'd like
you to talk about is you know not a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people use no-till techniques yet people
are still of the mind that you have to use
[SPEAKER_03]: fresh potting soil with with every new
grow but at the same time the the
[SPEAKER_03]: mycorrhizal fungi that you need to form to
move nutrients around the pot barely have
[SPEAKER_03]: time to form in an entire lifetime of an
auto flower plant and so um how do these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants i mean we we you know we've both
seen the flowers the flowers can be as as
[SPEAKER_03]: large as your forearm they're huge colons
oh yeah it's they're not they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: lacking in size how how is this plant
doing so much in soil that for most people
[SPEAKER_01]: is what we would consider new soil yeah
well first of all let's talk about this
[SPEAKER_01]: the concept of throwing your soil away
every time you grow a plant and then and
[SPEAKER_01]: then starting over again you know that's
that's old school as far as i'm concerned
[SPEAKER_01]: uh for a couple of reasons not the least
of which it's not regenerative uh it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable and if we're you know we we're
losing soil like no one's business in this
[SPEAKER_01]: world and and uh we got to be we got to we
got to keep it and we got to maintain it
[SPEAKER_01]: so but so so what happens when you grow a
plant is you know the root system develops
[SPEAKER_01]: it drips out all these exudates it
attracts the kinds of mycorrhizals uh
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not micro well it attracts both
mycorrhizal fungi but it also attracts uh
[SPEAKER_01]: uh you know the bacteria and the other
kinds of fungi that it needs in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to feed itself doesn't matter what
kind of plant it is that's just the way
[SPEAKER_01]: plants work that's teeming with microbes
um uh and and so this particular plant
[SPEAKER_01]: when you plant it does just like every
other plant does all of these things when
[SPEAKER_01]: you plant it in brand new soil it it it
has to create its own growth channels it
[SPEAKER_01]: has to uh really scream loudly to these uh
to these microbes to get in into the zone
[SPEAKER_01]: uh and uh you know it really has to do do
some work to establish the kind of uh
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that it needs in order to be
able to feed itself when you plant in a
[SPEAKER_01]: pot that's already had a cannabis plant
growing in it the microbes that support
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis are already in that pot they're
just dormant uh they're they're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right numbers immediately uh you don't
have to you know you don't have to attract
[SPEAKER_01]: them you don't have to gather them
together and this is all shorthand for you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what happens is the right microbes
have to take out the bad microbes so that
[SPEAKER_01]: the right balance is there all of this
stuff has already happened in your
[SPEAKER_01]: previous grow and as important the roots
of the plant have an opportunity to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in the channels left by the old root
channel system and so it's easier for not
[SPEAKER_01]: only is it easier for them but there are
decaying uh or or carbon containing old
[SPEAKER_01]: roots in those channels that are helping
to feed and maintain those microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: populations that are supporting the plant
so so for that reason it makes sense to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow almost any kind of a plant in a pot
that's had a similar plant grown in it
[SPEAKER_03]: previously did you just say before you go
on did you just say that there's karma
[SPEAKER_01]: left in the roots well there's karma and
carbon carbon okay carbon all right i like
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea of karma though but it is karma i
mean you know that's what that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what makes the plants grow it's
that carbon you know carbon is karma you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have carbon you don't have karma you
don't have life uh so anyway uh so as you
[SPEAKER_01]: take then you take a plant that has
genetically uh developed to grow quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: wow you know well if you give that plant
what it needs from the get-go it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: going uh so we plant these things uh we
you can start them using you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: paper towel trick etc etc and i and i do i
do most of mine that way for one simple
[SPEAKER_01]: reason because i then i dust both the seed
and that brand new root which which
[SPEAKER_01]: appears incidentally usually within about
24 hours uh as opposed to a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: longer or almost twice as long with with
regular cannabis plants i then sprinkle uh
[SPEAKER_01]: uh uh rhizophagus interocetes which is the
mycorrhizal fungi that feeds cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants i and so i know i'm getting the
exposure on the roots right away and then
[SPEAKER_01]: i plant that in the soil in the pot that
i'm going to grow the plant in for its
[SPEAKER_01]: entire life these plants cannot be root
bound a root bound plant while it while
[SPEAKER_01]: they're growing to their initial to their
to their size a root bound plants we you
[SPEAKER_01]: know has a lot of problems getting what it
needs and you don't want these plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: be root bound because they're growing so
quickly you want them to be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever they need right away and and uh
so you put a them in a five or seven
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pot three gallon minimum um and and
that's it that's the pot you want to use
[SPEAKER_01]: uh and you don't have to transplant them
uh every time you transplant a plant you
[SPEAKER_01]: are destroying uh the root hairs that are
that take a while for the plant to come
[SPEAKER_01]: back uh you stress a plant you can you can
stress a plant out and it can slow down
[SPEAKER_01]: for a week or so anytime you transplant it
so and when you transplant these and they
[SPEAKER_03]: lose a week that you're because they grow
so fast that's a significant part of their
[SPEAKER_01]: life you know it's like being away while
your kids are going through elementary
[SPEAKER_01]: school and then all of a sudden you're
back and you go what happened you know
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah exactly right you've got to be there
for these guys every single minute of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day because they're growing so quickly so
jeff oh sorry yeah so so so then the other
[SPEAKER_01]: thing of course is to make sure that
you've got the right soil we've talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about the fact that you don't want a soil
that's rich in nutrients it's great to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a soil that's been used once before
at least um but you got to have a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that drains well any plant needs that
these are just like tomato plants and so
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact hey guess what the same stuff that
you can use for growing tomatoes you can
[SPEAKER_01]: use for growing these plants uh it's got
to have good drainage it's got to have
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of organics we do not use chemicals
on these plants because we don't use
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals on any plants chemicals are
non-organic we don't go non-organic we
[SPEAKER_01]: only use organics because it's good for
the environment and it's because we put
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff into our systems so we want to
make sure that they're they're nice and
[SPEAKER_01]: organic if you have to feed the plant you
wait for the plant to tell you that it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs something and these plants will if
they need something because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing so quickly you'll see the sign
very quickly and if you get on it very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly uh you you can you can give them
what they need now what would you feed
[SPEAKER_01]: them with uh you know you can get a a you
know a good balanced uh you know i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know a 222 or something in that area type
type liquid fertilizer organic uh and and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can give that to the plant and and
you'll see a different right away compost
[SPEAKER_01]: tea works very very very nicely uh i like
a little bacterially dominated compost tea
[SPEAKER_01]: on these guys so so you see some problems
you can use that and you can always water
[SPEAKER_01]: with compost tea all that all all the way
along uh because you can't overwater with
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea it doesn't overfeed a plant uh
so there we go so when we've been talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about these these uh fast growing plants i
remember the first time i came across auto
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers and um and then you brought it
home for me at emerald cup when we talked
[SPEAKER_03]: about it last year when when we were
talking about how they go from germination
[SPEAKER_03]: to harvest in 90 days not 90 days of you
know flower but the entire life span and
[SPEAKER_03]: being finished and being not being light
dependent which means that if you live
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere that's got inclement weather or
or uh short summers like the pacific
[SPEAKER_03]: northwest where i live or for goodness
sakes alaska where you live but also you
[SPEAKER_03]: know the new england states and and far uh
far south of the equator we all don't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily have enough summer to to to
grow regular plants but then you get
[SPEAKER_03]: something like this and you take an auto
flower and you can germinate on say june 1
[SPEAKER_03]: and it grows june july and august and you
you harvest on september 1st well before
[SPEAKER_03]: the rains like when i first realized that
it literally blew my mind because this
[SPEAKER_03]: opens up so much for for patients and for
gardeners like you're talking about and
[SPEAKER_03]: and for uh you know anybody who does not
want to deal with mold and botrytis at the
[SPEAKER_03]: end of the year where i'm going with this
though is that i had that mindset at 90
[SPEAKER_03]: days but then now there are these new
cultivars that are 60 days and now people
[SPEAKER_03]: are telling me that they've grown these 30
days which i have yet to grow but a 30 day
[SPEAKER_03]: from germination to finish flowers you
know i'm like i can accept it's not going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be a huge plant but the fact that it
goes through its life span so quickly
[SPEAKER_03]: blows me away my question for you is is
how did we get to 90 60 and 30 day
[SPEAKER_03]: varietals when they're all crossed with
rudy right uh well uh there are different
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of ruderalis first of all uh and so
some some ruderalis take longer to bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: than others and and i was stunned uh to to
start receiving in the mail different
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of ruderalis sees that people have
collected um and and so that's the first
[SPEAKER_01]: reason the second reason is of course
you're breeding them with plants that also
[SPEAKER_01]: have uh some genetics and and there's
something in some of those plants you know
[SPEAKER_01]: that impacts the duration of the of the uh
the growth period so so it's sort of a
[SPEAKER_01]: double whammy i it's something coming from
the from the sativa indicus uh and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the difference in in the genetics of
the ruderalis itself right on so uh let's
[SPEAKER_03]: go ahead and take our second short break
and we come back and do set three um we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to talk a little bit about uh
succession planning for auto flowers which
[SPEAKER_03]: which is an interesting idea with uh
cannabis um but also uh jeff has agreed to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk a little bit about his background
which we haven't really heard a lot about
[SPEAKER_03]: so that'll be cool so you are listening to
shaping fire i'm your host shango los and
[SPEAKER_03]: our guest this week is gardening author
jeff lowenfels we'll be right back living
[SPEAKER_03]: soil and regenerative cannabis agriculture
are surging in popularity and to implement
[SPEAKER_03]: these biological solutions real science
education is vital if you are interested
[SPEAKER_03]: in all things probiotic growing you will
probably want to attend this year's
[SPEAKER_03]: science of organic regenerative cannabis
cultivation conference for the third year
[SPEAKER_03]: in a row co-founders joshua rutherford of
dutch blooms and latin morrison of kingdom

that not only was cannabis a huge help in
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling my symptoms but i found
cannabis to be wonderfully social too
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis makes friends so i took my love
of jewelry design and blended it with my
[SPEAKER_00]: newfound passion for cannabis and began

shop dot co thanks welcome back you are
[SPEAKER_03]: listening to shaping fire i'm your host
shangalose and our guest this week is
[SPEAKER_03]: gardening author jeff lowenfels so uh last
set we talked a little bit about how the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant thinks and how best to care for her
and um how rare um her nutrient intake is
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the things that we just hinted on
before the commercial was the the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that uh she grows so quickly that you can
actually do multiple rounds during the
[SPEAKER_03]: summer and and um and certainly you can do
uh cannabis plants end to end or
[SPEAKER_03]: autoflower plants end to end where you you
start something in may and then you finish
[SPEAKER_03]: it in uh july and then go ahead and
replant right in the pot um but because
[SPEAKER_03]: succession planning is so rare in cannabis
for photo um photosensitive plants jeff i
[SPEAKER_03]: don't think that a lot of people who grow
cannabis only and not vegetables
[SPEAKER_03]: understand the idea of succession
succession planning that we get from other
[SPEAKER_03]: quick to bolt crops like lettuces and
stuff right so would you go ahead and and
[SPEAKER_03]: explain succession planning and how it can
apply to autoflowers that you so that
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got a rolling harvest throughout
the year well there's there's a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to apply it uh outdoors uh if you're
a regular gardener you you know that you
[SPEAKER_01]: just don't plant a you know a crop of
lettuce or radish these quick growing
[SPEAKER_01]: things uh you plant several of them and
then there's two ways to do it one is you
[SPEAKER_01]: wait until your first crop is finished you
plant a second crop or you wait a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of weeks after you put the first crop in
and then you plant the second crop so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have what's known as a continuous
harvest at the end of the season and and
[SPEAKER_01]: uh that's how lots of people grow lettuce
so that they they have lettuce every every
[SPEAKER_01]: night instead of just having it all you
know all at once with autoflowers you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do the same thing you can you can either
plant the plant uh wait for it to harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: and then plant a new plant in the same pot
or you can get another pot after two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks and start a new plant so that
you have a rolling a rolling harvest kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a nice way to go because it's a
sometimes it's sort of a pain to clean
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants and you know prepare them for
drying uh it's nice to maybe maybe extend
[SPEAKER_01]: the process and if you're an indoor
commercial grower you can use these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in a in a similar kind of sort of quasi
succession way if you're growing in your
[SPEAKER_01]: veg stage you can put these plants in
between your your bigger the bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: cousins uh that have a photo period uh and
similarly once they're in flower you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do this you know the bigger cousins are in
you go to the flower stage you can do the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing you can either start new ones
or you can finish off your autos but
[SPEAKER_01]: normally what happens is your autos flower
and and are harvested at the same time you
[SPEAKER_01]: then flip the switch and get into the
flowering stage on the big guy so you go
[SPEAKER_01]: from vegetative to and it's it's just sort
of neat that you can add on to your
[SPEAKER_01]: existing harvest either by repeating the
same plant or by using these plants to
[SPEAKER_03]: supplement what you're growing elsewhere
we all have the experience of coming up to
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest and then suddenly having a whole
bunch of plants to dry and trim at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time and for folks who are not
professionals you know normally we are
[SPEAKER_03]: hanging the plants in our living room or
are in our basement or the you know garage
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever and we only have a limited
amount of space there i mean heck some
[SPEAKER_03]: people are are drying in their closets and
that's one thing that's really great for
[SPEAKER_03]: the home grower the patient grower the
gardener that if you want to start seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: this week and next week and the following
week depending on you know your room maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to make it every three weeks this
idea that you could be harvesting in you
[SPEAKER_03]: know the beginning of the july and then
the end of july and then the middle of
[SPEAKER_03]: september and then it really allows you to
be more productive with less space and
[SPEAKER_03]: also if you live in a state that only
allows four or six plants and you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to bother to stay within the law it's like
okay fine you know i'm going to grow my
[SPEAKER_03]: six plants but i'm going to do i'm going
to do six four times this summer instead
[SPEAKER_03]: of six that's going to last all summer and
that's all i get and sure granted and
[SPEAKER_03]: generally the the plants are still smaller
than full-size plants but when you add all
[SPEAKER_03]: the grams and the convenience together at
the end of the summer for most people it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to make a lot more sense to do this
kind of succession planning oh yeah and
[SPEAKER_01]: you get to grow different kinds of plants
so i you know i don't know about you but
[SPEAKER_01]: after after a while of you know using the
same cannabis week in and week out like we
[SPEAKER_01]: used to do it during prohibition when you
you know didn't have a source of different
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds you know it's not the same it's not
the same high it doesn't have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: effect but being able to have variety oh
yeah that's the way that you know variety
[SPEAKER_01]: is the spice of life and so so so auto
flowers it's just like tomatoes i keep
[SPEAKER_01]: saying this is the next tomato plant you
can grow so many different kinds you can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow constantly always have a harvest and
and so far we've really really been
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about growing them outside but
they grow indoors in the winter time and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody needs to have a set of lights in
the winter time anyhow for their other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants you know your house plants need
need light if you're a gardener you need a
[SPEAKER_01]: set of lights i always try to tell people
in america because i write nationally you
[SPEAKER_01]: need a set of lights in the winter we all
need lights in the winter the plants need
[SPEAKER_01]: lights in the winter well if you've got
lights to grow your other house plants you
[SPEAKER_01]: can be growing auto flower cannabis plants
as well and now that there's enough really
[SPEAKER_03]: good um you know full spectrum growing
lights out there it's gonna you know the
[SPEAKER_03]: same location that can use these plants
most like up here us up in the north right
[SPEAKER_03]: it also helps with our seasonal
effectiveness disorder from lack of sun
[SPEAKER_01]: for in two ways uh the product itself yeah
yeah absolutely uh and and again as i say
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's fun it's there's so much fun to
grow i mean yeah you know a plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've never seen before unfurling before
your eyes is a thing of beauty it's uh you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's a you know it's a mind blower
and these plants are mind blowing and one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the things that i liked about it is
actually one of the things that some
[SPEAKER_03]: people complain about it's like okay yeah
sometimes the seeds um are you know they
[SPEAKER_03]: may be they're stable as far as like
herming but they're not all the same right
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to get a lot of different
phenos in the same pack more often than
[SPEAKER_03]: not and and they express some traits that
are from the ruderalis um often though
[SPEAKER_03]: though you know these generalizations are
certainly not applicable to the entire you
[SPEAKER_03]: know uh family of cultivars right right
but after you know growing them this was
[SPEAKER_03]: my second summer growing them um i really
and you know as somebody who loves
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis loves the plant is interested in
cannabis botany it was interesting to see
[SPEAKER_03]: all these different um terpene profiles
and and how the plant presents itself over
[SPEAKER_03]: the last two years i i actually had a
grower here on the island um uh who is a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis patient and she just does a few
plants on her deck every year and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: she she grew a set of auto flowers in the
spring and then she had her full terms um
[SPEAKER_03]: and when she harvested or she was going to
harvest her auto flowers she sent me a
[SPEAKER_03]: picture she's like is this is this
smokable is this right and and you know it
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a particularly unusual looking
canvas plant it was it was clearly a happy
[SPEAKER_03]: plant with lots of uh trichomes and it
smelled great but uh for those of us who
[SPEAKER_03]: uh grow regular plants it would the plant
kind of looked like it was all fox tailed
[SPEAKER_03]: and so for for for for those of us who
have been growing a while be like there
[SPEAKER_03]: that is a that's a mutant that's a weird
thing but actually the plant smelled great
[SPEAKER_03]: and was awesome smoke and it was just
expressing some of these oddities that
[SPEAKER_03]: come from the rooty side and so you know
was it necessarily something that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to want to put in the centerfold of
high times well maybe maybe not it
[SPEAKER_03]: probably would have gotten some really
difficult feedback from people but as
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody who loves to watch nature express
itself it sure as hell is interesting yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: you know we've we've we've become so
accustomed to blood poured yeah which is
[SPEAKER_01]: which is sort of meaningless when you
think about it i mean i'd so much rather i
[SPEAKER_01]: love it i mean but i'd much rather see a
chart that tells me what the terpene you
[SPEAKER_01]: know uh profile is but and the flavonoid
profile uh because that tells me what the
[SPEAKER_01]: beauty of the plant is it's it's not how
the plant actually really looks so but yes
[SPEAKER_01]: you're right you get some very strange
looking things sometimes uh and and you
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder where did that come from and then
you you know you got to that's part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder of these things this is a plant
growing before our eyes evolving before
[SPEAKER_01]: our eyes you this is something you would
have the capability of being able to breed
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself uh you know it's it's just this
is why i think it's america's next tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: plant it's just something that's fun to be
with and work with and grow so and and
[SPEAKER_01]: your and your friend you know i would have
said to your friend don't forget you can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow these in the winter too uh indoors
yeah try that with your big ones you know
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah totally so so jeff before we wrap up
you know uh when you and i did the uh the
[SPEAKER_03]: the 10 video shaping fire sessions which
since this is going to come out on october
[SPEAKER_03]: 22nd all 10 episodes are are now out um
and and so so you and i got together and
[SPEAKER_03]: we recorded these and we we had some time
in between um videos and and and you were
[SPEAKER_03]: willing to share some of your background
with me because most of us in cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: know about you as the the lord of the
roots the writer of the you know teaming
[SPEAKER_03]: with microbes teaming with fungi and
teaming with nutrient series that is is
[SPEAKER_03]: you know essential reading and cannabis
which i didn't understand until later is
[SPEAKER_03]: also essential reading and gardening but
you know for those of us in cannabis it
[SPEAKER_03]: was it's a holy trilogy um but then you
and i got to start talking and and i've
[SPEAKER_03]: done enough introductions for you before
that that when i get to the part where i
[SPEAKER_03]: where i say that you are you know a
recovering attorney everybody kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: chuckles and we move on but it wasn't
until we talked that i realized what a
[SPEAKER_03]: serious big player power attorney you were
and at the same time you were remaining
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting in gardening so just because
i've never heard this covered anywhere
[SPEAKER_03]: else will you tell us a little bit about
your your life as an attorney that was
[SPEAKER_03]: running parallel to your interest in
gardening yeah well i went i went to law
[SPEAKER_01]: school in boston and while i was there i
was on a date with a lovely young lady who
[SPEAKER_01]: happened to be a nurse and and we were
held up i was shot she saved my life i
[SPEAKER_01]: woke up the next morning she was there
with my glasses and my law school
[SPEAKER_01]: textbooks and i you know i got shot in the
neck and i i stumbled out let's get
[SPEAKER_01]: married to save my life and she said no uh
you owe me but yeah okay and then i said
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're going to go to anchorage alaska
and so we ended up in anchorage alaska uh
[SPEAKER_01]: and i i i had a law degree and uh i always
had a hobby gardening uh but when i got to
[SPEAKER_01]: anchorage alaska uh and was was practicing
law i discovered uh that the local
[SPEAKER_01]: newspapers were both published by
different publishers and one of them uh
[SPEAKER_01]: was a but they were both printed by one
publisher and distributed by one publisher
[SPEAKER_01]: we handled all the advertising long story
short we had a good paper and we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: really bad paper and in a place like
alaska where we were getting all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: news two or three days late because we
were so far away and they had to fly the
[SPEAKER_01]: videos up etc etc no satellites back then
uh you know it was important to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: newspaper alive and we did and i helped
quite a bit and the publisher asked me
[SPEAKER_01]: what else i could do and i said i can
write a garden column and so i started to
[SPEAKER_01]: write a garden column uh as a way to help
this newspaper but also as a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: fulfill my family obligation to write a
letter a week to my parents back in new
[SPEAKER_01]: york and my father's a big gardener and so
i would always write about gardening and
[SPEAKER_01]: so the column sort of became a letter home
to my father um and then it became a
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievable legal tool i was an assistant
attorney general i was going in and out of
[SPEAKER_01]: court on temporary restraining orders all
the time i was doing really high power oil
[SPEAKER_01]: and gas stuff involving exxon and bp and
so hyo and you know all these big oil
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that deal up in alaska i was
representing the state and i was i had the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to be able to go in and you know i
needed to get a judge again on this
[SPEAKER_01]: calendar or her calendar you know and the
secretary would always say oh before what
[SPEAKER_01]: am i to do about my african violet over
here you know so it became a really great
[SPEAKER_01]: legal tool and and i remember my first
case in the supreme court of the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: alaska against these oil companies sent
their lawyers up from all over the you
[SPEAKER_01]: know really high power attorneys my first
time in the supreme court and the first
[SPEAKER_01]: question mr loanfels my wife wants to know
what does she do about you know and you
[SPEAKER_01]: could see the ex secretary of army who was
representing exxon understand exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: had just happened to him anyway so i
practiced law and i was i was a lawyer i
[SPEAKER_01]: was an assistant attorney general for for
five and a half for six years back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day when alaska didn't really have any uh
attorney generals uh and so i represented
[SPEAKER_01]: all sorts of terrific agencies uh ended up
uh doing a tremendous amount of a private
[SPEAKER_01]: practice mining law oil and gas law
environmental law uh and i had a client uh
[SPEAKER_01]: who was the governor of the state of
alaska named wally hickle who had a dream
[SPEAKER_01]: to build a gas pipeline that ran right
along the oil pipeline that took the gas
[SPEAKER_01]: that was being produced with that oil but
was being pumped back into the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: bring it down to valdez convert it to
liquefied natural gas and ship it to japan
[SPEAKER_01]: korea and taiwan and solve our balance of
payments with all of those companies the
[SPEAKER_01]: countries as well as stimulate the economy
all around the country so so i worked on
[SPEAKER_01]: that project for years and years and years
uh it was purchased by a fortune 500
[SPEAKER_01]: company uh i became the president of the
company uh we permitted this unbelievable
[SPEAKER_01]: project even in the face of the exxon
valdez oil spill we had an environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: impact statement that basically came out
you know two months later in the same area
[SPEAKER_01]: uh we got all of the permits for a project
that you've never heard of that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: world's largest construction project uh
that ended up uh for for political reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: and i i contend some nefarious ones at
that uh getting killed by the governor of
[SPEAKER_01]: the state of alaska uh and and so uh at
that point in time i decided you know this
[SPEAKER_01]: legal stuff is is fun but uh it's it's
time to do something else and so i went
[SPEAKER_03]: especially when you're doing the kind of
law that you could turn the keys on your
[SPEAKER_01]: car and your car could explode yeah i was
you know i i i worried about the oil
[SPEAKER_01]: companies blowing up my car uh there was
no question uh i would i've been told uh
[SPEAKER_01]: that i was extremely hated and feared uh
you know by bp and some of these other oil
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and well they should hate me and
fear me because they they didn't treat
[SPEAKER_01]: alaska well uh and they certainly didn't
treat this project well but but in any
[SPEAKER_01]: case not to be too bitter about it all uh
i i during the uh 10 year at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: this project now you have to understand
that any big project that involves natural
[SPEAKER_01]: resources in alaska is a transportation
play it all comes down to transportation
[SPEAKER_01]: we are so far away from everything we are
closer to tokyo than we are to washington
[SPEAKER_01]: dc that everything involves transportation
and and the last couple of months of my
[SPEAKER_01]: career with this project a guy a truck
driver walked into my office and he said
[SPEAKER_01]: to me i've got this special soil that we
got up here all over the place and and i i
[SPEAKER_01]: want to get it down to the lower 48 states
and it's a transportation play and you
[SPEAKER_01]: sure know an awful lot about it can you
help me well lo and behold it turned out
[SPEAKER_01]: that this soil was very special soil it
had the highest microbiology that anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: had ever seen in soil uh and it was all
over the state of alaska and particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the anchorage area and it turns
out to be the soil that grew the big
[SPEAKER_01]: cabbages that everybody knows about so i
got involved with it and and through being
[SPEAKER_01]: coming involved with this guy this truck
driver i i met dr elaine ingham i was
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced to the soil food web and when i
went out from from the project and went
[SPEAKER_01]: into a practice representing alaskan
inventors i started to write teeming with
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes for regular gardeners because i
felt that i had been so betrayed by the
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening industry telling me i needed
chemicals and i needed miracle grow and i
[SPEAKER_01]: needed you know weed be gone and all these
terrible things when in fact it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil food web that ran the system uh that
that that there was that truck driver uh
[SPEAKER_01]: and then through tom alexander a mutual
friend of ours uh mine uh who i i want you
[SPEAKER_01]: to meet and who i dedicated this uh a diy
auto flowering cannabis book to uh wow i
[SPEAKER_01]: just i just got so turned down by the soil
food web that i wrote these soil food web
[SPEAKER_01]: books and and uh i wouldn't have done it
had i not been a lawyer uh and ran into uh
[SPEAKER_01]: this this fellow uh fascinating absolutely
fascinating great great way to pull it all
[SPEAKER_03]: together so before i let you go i do want
to hit on one more uh growing related uh
[SPEAKER_03]: question and you know anybody who has
emailed with you sees in your signature on
[SPEAKER_03]: all your email it says plant a row for the
hungry and i know you're very passionate
[SPEAKER_03]: about this program so why don't you tell
us a little bit to maybe inspire us and
[SPEAKER_03]: get some some more people to participate
yeah this is one of the things that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: me cry you know uh but anyway uh so while
i was working on this gigantic project i
[SPEAKER_01]: used to go to asia once a month and
washington dc once a month and i was in
[SPEAKER_01]: washington dc and of course you would go
to washington dc on a fortune 500 expense
[SPEAKER_01]: account you go first class so i flew first
class i stayed at the first class hotel
[SPEAKER_01]: the willard hotel and i ate first class to
the expense account restaurants and i was
[SPEAKER_01]: there one week it was the coldest week
they had ever experienced in washington dc
[SPEAKER_01]: and leaving with my hands in my pockets
because it was so cold with money wrapped
[SPEAKER_01]: around you know in my hands and a guy came
up to me and said i need some food can you
[SPEAKER_01]: give me some money well in washington dc
there are signs everywhere they say do not
[SPEAKER_01]: give money to panhandlers we have our own
system blah blah blah and so i refused to
[SPEAKER_01]: give the guy money i and he followed me
and he said come with me watch me eat and
[SPEAKER_01]: i still thinking of those signs did not
help him i ended up at the willard hotel
[SPEAKER_01]: the doorman you know saw me coming with
this guy following me he saw the doorman
[SPEAKER_01]: he ran away i went to bed that night in my
hotel room which had not just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: little you know chocolate on the it had a
fruit basket a bottle of wine i had the
[SPEAKER_01]: worst night's sleep of my life it was
scrooge i saw my parents you know what did
[SPEAKER_01]: you do to that you stiffed a guy who
needed your help that's not the lo and
[SPEAKER_01]: fells way and oh my god i woke up the next
morning it was still freezing i looked for
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy all over the place i had to take
my plane home they finally opened the
[SPEAKER_01]: airport i got on the flight i'm flying
first class i'm flying over over your area
[SPEAKER_01]: of ashen island you know having a great
flight drink i have a steak and zucchini
[SPEAKER_01]: and i'm looking down at it and i can't get
this guy out of my mind and i think about
[SPEAKER_01]: the zucchini and the joke that if you live
in wisconsin and and you you park your car
[SPEAKER_01]: at night you always make sure you lock it
because if you don't when you get into car
[SPEAKER_01]: the next morning it's full of someone's
zucchini uh you know it's so hard to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know give away and i said jeez i you know
that's what i'm going to do i'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get everybody an anchorage to help assuage
my bad conscience for stiffing this guy i
[SPEAKER_01]: can still see his face today for stiffing
this guy i'm going to get everybody to
[SPEAKER_01]: donate one row on their garden through my
garden column to what's known as beans
[SPEAKER_01]: cafe our soup kitchen up here and it was a
very successful program and it helped me
[SPEAKER_01]: feel a little bit better i only had the
nightmare once a month you know i only
[SPEAKER_01]: heard my father's you know you know once a
month uh and and and then one day the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden writers of america came came to
alaska for a convention they heard about
[SPEAKER_01]: the program they visited beans cafe and we
adopted it as a national program and it
[SPEAKER_01]: exists still today we we supply tons tens
and hundreds of tons of food a year to
[SPEAKER_01]: supply to soup kitchens to synagogues
churches uh you know food banks any place
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll take food the gardener grows it
the gardener harvests it the gardener
[SPEAKER_01]: takes it in nothing slips between the lip
and cup in terms of money no
[SPEAKER_01]: administrative costs no you know you don't
have to support anybody the it's plant a
[SPEAKER_01]: row for the hungry and i encourage
everybody to plant one row in their garden
[SPEAKER_01]: to feed the hungry and if you're growing
only cannabis then some of your cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: ought to go to a vet or somebody that
needs medical cannabis because gardeners
[SPEAKER_01]: share and that's the best way we can
possibly do it we have 30 some odd million
[SPEAKER_01]: people going to bed every night hungry in
the united states of america unconsciously
[SPEAKER_01]: eligible just just incredible and then you
know you you go out of your garden and
[SPEAKER_01]: bash an island and you look at somebody
who's left broccoli there or left lettuce
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're sick of sick of it after
the you know no you take it to somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: that needs it this is has to be the basis
of how we live so there i am you can

[SPEAKER_01]: information that's interesting i mean
something that they can actually employ in
[SPEAKER_01]: growing plants that'll make them a better

something right on well we will certainly
