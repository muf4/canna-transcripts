[SPEAKER_01]: You and I have spent so much time and
effort defending cannabis from pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we had to explain to people
cannabis was medicine and not an addictive
[SPEAKER_01]: drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had to illustrate that stoners
were not necessarily lazy or unmotivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have vision and take action.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to prove to our politicians that it
somehow would benefit them just to even
[SPEAKER_01]: get it normalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with all the state laws favoring
indoor cultivation, we have to consider
[SPEAKER_01]: the very real issue that cannabis
cultivated indoors might be bad for our
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, electrical grid stability,
the cannabis economy and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: community as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just not something I want to think
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to this episode,
you are already a good person in my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine lots of folks might skip this
shaping fire episode simply because they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to think about how much energy
cannabis consumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being a cannabis enthusiast means
looking at everything to do with our
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite plant and having the backbone to
know when decreasing our carbon footprint,
[SPEAKER_01]: emissions and fertilizer runoff is a very
important consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we will mostly be talking about
indoor cultivated cannabis today,
[SPEAKER_01]: but outdoor and greenhouses have some
energy aspects to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: To whether you are an environmentalist,
an outdoor cultivator, an indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator, looking to decrease your bills
or looking to make a case to start growing
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode is for you.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to episode 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Dr. Evan Mills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evan has an exceptionally prestigious
resume and you can read it fully on his
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some highlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Evan Mills is a retired senior
scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National
[SPEAKER_01]: Laboratory, one of the world's leading
research centers on energy and
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: He continues his collaborations with the
lab as an affiliate and is also a research
[SPEAKER_01]: affiliate with the energy and resources
group at UC Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: He consults widely for private industry
and the public sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has published 372 articles and reports,
including contributions to 17 books and
[SPEAKER_01]: has spoken in 21 countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2007, Evan shared a Nobel peace prize
as a member of the United Nations
[SPEAKER_01]: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evan has worked as an energy and
environmental systems analyst on projects
[SPEAKER_01]: ranging from local to global scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the mid 1980s, he studied and taught
about green buildings before the term was
[SPEAKER_01]: in vogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: He received a master's of science degree
in 1987 from UC Berkeley's energy and
[SPEAKER_01]: resources group and a PhD in 1991 from the
department environmental and energy system
[SPEAKER_01]: studies at Lund University in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_01]: While in Sweden, he worked closely with
the Swedish state power board and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Swedish national board for industrial and
technical development on national energy
[SPEAKER_01]: planning projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: His specialties are energy efficiency and
buildings and industry and the
[SPEAKER_01]: intersection of energy technology,
global climate, and risk management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evan frequently writes for popular and
trade publications, including Forbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: the LA Times, Slate, Salon, Technology
Review, and the Washington Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his work has been covered pretty much
everywhere, including the Atlantic,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bloomberg, The Economist, the Financial
Times, High Times, National Geographic,
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature, Popular Science, Rolling Stone,
Scientific American, and Wired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evan now lives in the Redwoods on the
Northern California coast and is an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic vegetable gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a novel side note, when Evan was a
kid, he attended the Halloween parties
[SPEAKER_01]: that Chichen Chow threw for their kids in
1970s Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we will be discussing the ways that
cannabis cultivation uses energy and the
[SPEAKER_01]: places you can save money by changing to
energy efficient alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the first set, we will talk about
the overall size of the energy footprint
[SPEAKER_01]: of U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation and then dive into
lights, HVAC, and other big ticket energy
[SPEAKER_01]: users.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the second set, we dig into drying,
transportation, packaging, and retail,
[SPEAKER_01]: along with a bunch of other sleep or ways
that we waste energy cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we finished the episode looking at
cannabis delivery and energy efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars, along with the market and
political bias in favor of indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation and the possible impacts that
interstate commerce and national
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization might have on cannabis energy
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Evan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Evan, like let's repeat what I've
already said in the introduction once
[SPEAKER_01]: since you have worked with so many
heavies, that you are here on your own
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity as a consultant and that this
work and your opinions today do not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily reflect those of the companies
or institutions with which you have worked
[SPEAKER_01]: for and you are here talking just for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's fun to be chatting with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your name has been on my lips for like
almost a decade, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Dominic Korva turned me on to your
work in like 2014 or 15 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been repeating it and watching it
and watching for more ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then last week, when I saw your paper
come out, it was like a long missed
[SPEAKER_01]: returning friend, Evan, even though I
don't know you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was nice to connect with you via
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate you being here
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominic put together a great book a couple
of years ago with, you know, 30 or so
[SPEAKER_00]: chapters from different experts all around
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had the pleasure of contributing a
chapter to that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when Dominic put it out,
he was actually on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about that at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bet you your name came up during
that episode as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but we are here today because you have
recently updated your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a newly published paper in One
Earth called Energy Intensive Indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation Drives Cannabis Industries
Expansion Standing Carbon Footprint,
[SPEAKER_01]: which pretty much like the sauce is in the
title, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know exactly where we're coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so today I wanted to invite you on the
show so that we can tease out all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: places or at least many of the places
where cannabis companies can reduce their
[SPEAKER_01]: energy usage and reduce their carbon
footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's no question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reading your paper that you're making the
case for outdoor cannabis, of which we are
[SPEAKER_01]: huge proponents for here on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also recognize that many of the
companies have got themselves into the
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor side financially and they might not
be able to transition out right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe in the interim, we can at
least start with electrical being used
[SPEAKER_01]: less often and start moving us all,
the industry as a whole, in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I appreciate the vantage point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say for me in particular,
my home field, my work is around energy
[SPEAKER_00]: management, energy analysis, energy
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I started here on this spectrum
almost 15 years ago was let's raise energy
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency and indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can achieve whatever we need to by
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, I found how virtually
impossible that is to really get to a zero
[SPEAKER_00]: net carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't start with the assumption that
outdoor was the only really tenable
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to that very slowly because again,
my hammer is energy efficiency and all my
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions, all my nails are energy
efficiency usually in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a very different kind of very
interesting, rich sandbox here where there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a lot more options.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing just to footnote is that
it's important to talk about energy as
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct from electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not often the case, certainly not
always the case that a given grow outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: or indoor is all electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fossil fuel used in a myriad of
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean in every single grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like in my study where I'm looking at
the whole life cycle, not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation phase, half of the total
energy nationally at the end of the day is
[SPEAKER_00]: fossil fuel directly, not even including
the fossil fuel going into the electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: production itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to think widely and look
widely at where energy in all its forms
[SPEAKER_00]: might be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for pointing that out because I
definitely used the word electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I will probably slip and use
it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you using that clarity and
I apologize for when I miss it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a common thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe another thing just to layer in
here, and we can come back to it later if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want, is that while like you said,
the title of the paper flags or signals
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the main findings, it is nuanced
wording and that on the one hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor is not intrinsically the solution
or fully sustainable and indoor similarly,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a big spectrum of emissions and
things you might get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there can be plenty of problems around
energy and sustainability more broadly
[SPEAKER_00]: with outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not simply a matter of flicking a
switch and going to especially the current
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial scale paradigm of outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than that would be needed to
really address climate, let alone all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other environmental things that we're
aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really surprised in the new paper of
all the places that you illustrate where
[SPEAKER_01]: energy is being used intensely and is a
place that we can either decrease our
[SPEAKER_01]: energy use or get rid of it completely by
replacing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually find more interest in that than
even in the lights, but let's go ahead and
[SPEAKER_01]: start with that because everybody pretty
much considers that to be the elephant in
[SPEAKER_01]: the room is that when we bring the plants
indoors, we have to create a man-made sun
[SPEAKER_01]: and we do that by throwing lots of jewels
at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of me trying to tease out the
specifics, I know that you have answered
[SPEAKER_01]: this question many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to kind of hand you the
mic and ask you to describe the problem
[SPEAKER_01]: with using so much energy in cannabis
indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can start with lights because
that's where you want it to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where everyone goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people say on the layperson end
of the spectrum thinks that's the only
[SPEAKER_00]: energy use, which is fine, you know,
mistake or whatever for general public,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting is big.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking, I mean, of course,
there are different, lots of different
[SPEAKER_00]: growing contexts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have the plant factory that's
windowless and all the lumens,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the photons are electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can of course have, I hate the term
mixed light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting because it's like jargon and,
you know, regulators use it, but let's
[SPEAKER_00]: call them greenhouses and greenhouses can
be also no electric photons, or they can
[SPEAKER_00]: have some electric photons and most
industrial cannabis greenhouses do use
[SPEAKER_00]: electric lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, lighting is, you know,
loosely like a third of the total energy
[SPEAKER_00]: use total carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It totally depends, you know, where you
are and what genetics you have and what
[SPEAKER_00]: the facilities like, but you know,
lighting is big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether it's LED or HID or something
else, nickel metal halide, it's still a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and people look at the LED as
this panacea and it's rolled out
[SPEAKER_00]: reflexively all the time in conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a big fan of LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: My house is all LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's what's not to like,
no mercury, you know, energy savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember that to replace, let's call
it a thousand watt HID light, that's a 600
[SPEAKER_00]: watt LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still like a small floor heater under
your desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly energy intensive and you
put, you know, a few thousand of those in
[SPEAKER_00]: a big greenhouse and you need a lot of air
conditioning to deal just with the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: off the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, it saves energy, but it only moves
the needle so much and it's only
[SPEAKER_00]: addressing a third of the energy use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you may get some cooling savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also get some increased heating
energy need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, it's a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always think about buildings as systems
whether it's a, you know, a school or an
[SPEAKER_00]: office or a cannabis grow, their leg bones
connected to the hip bone and lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: effects cooling and, you know,
all the uses are connected in important
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, I hope that that's
helpful as far as lighting can talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's- It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a follow-up for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we go to conventions, the lighting
manufacturers are continuing to impress us
[SPEAKER_01]: with or seeking to impress us.
[SPEAKER_01]: With their increased energy conservation
and things are getting better and every
[SPEAKER_01]: new model is going to use less energy and
save the cultivators pocket money,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see exploratory science in
cultivation lights that is forthcoming?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually going to be helpful
because I get what you're saying right now
[SPEAKER_01]: about LED is yes, yes, it's better than
metal halide, but really it's not moving
[SPEAKER_01]: the needle that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I wanted to keep my LEDs and wanted
to keep running indoor, my first response
[SPEAKER_01]: would be, well, the technology is almost
there and it's about to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just need to put our energy into
LED research instead of trying to move us
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a broader, you know, just kind of
conceptual problem or challenge or
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending how you want to look at it in
energy management writ large, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: never a silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, data center, cement factory,
cannabis grow house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an orchestra, you know, of measures
that you need and want and are prudent to
[SPEAKER_00]: pursue for all kinds of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's never one thing that's going to
solve a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even, you know, you look at a car and like
an electric car, well, there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 30 different energy
efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of efficiency measures going
on within that car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always a constellation of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: With lighting, just to footnote a little
bit what we were saying a minute ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also, you know, it's very,
I don't like the word strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everybody uses it, but it's not
actually the word that's used in agronomy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, more broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're crops, you know, or they're
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are interesting papers, not enough
of them, but in my paper, Figure 5 brings
[SPEAKER_00]: the data together from one of the studies
and they looked at multiple strains under
[SPEAKER_00]: LED versus HID lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sobering to see that some of them
don't save any energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much very little energy and others
save a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's like a factor of strain and
genetics and cultivar in the lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's a problem, again,
more broadly in energy called the
[SPEAKER_00]: take-back effect that actually gets kind
of embraced by climate change and climate
[SPEAKER_00]: deniers and so on a lot by saying that,
well, if we save energy in one place,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're just going to use more somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't subscribe to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the evidence doesn't support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do see a lot of places where
cannabis grows and you'll, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the trade literature, you'll see the
advertisements from the lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers brighter than the sun,
not just as bright as, and people will
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the DLIs and increase their
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to think about energy per
unit yield rather than energy per square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is often happening that people,
because they're saving so much money on
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting energy bills, that they will pump
more light in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not the expected,
you know, behavior with energy efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one has to look carefully at how
much energy is being saved and how you're
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring, you know, those savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a little bit more on light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can steer me back around if I didn't
actually answer your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, that's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my follow up question now, I recognize
that that you are here to raise the flag
[SPEAKER_01]: of using too much energy and it isn't
necessarily also your mandate to solve
[SPEAKER_01]: them all and to solve the policy questions
behind them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that in mind, I'm still going to
ask you a solutions policy question just
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have had this conversation
with many people and perhaps you have
[SPEAKER_01]: heard something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you're not, you know,
you're a friend of cannabis and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of the indoor outdoor cannabis
debate about quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I, and generally the guests
on this show loved, you know, we stand
[SPEAKER_01]: with sungrown flower as having a wider
aroma profile and healthier plants and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, more resilient, higher yields,
all of this kind of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is something that is quite
special and unique about a flower that is
[SPEAKER_01]: grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an aesthetic value and also to get
outdoor cannabis that competes with the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are only a handful of places in the
country that can do that naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and so a lot of people just
aren't interested in this discussion at
[SPEAKER_01]: all because they want to grow the best
cannabis in their region and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: live in Garberville.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and so people say, Hey,
I'm going to turn to my indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any idea of how we can resolve
the, the people wanting to grow good
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in places where the weather is
not Northern California?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the answers are
counterintuitive, I think, and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: pretend to have all the answers,
but it's, it's such an important line of
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, if you, you probably have
already, but if not, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a whole show on really drilling
into the quality question is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm, uh, you know, there's a lot to
it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What defines quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, the visual,
there's the aromatic, there's the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, there's the inebriation effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many vectors of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're all things people are
seeking just like a good wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but there is debate there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of, and including in
the science literature, looking at CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles, uh, that, you know, outdoor is
not necessarily inferior at all by,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, many metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and when you look at, and I'm not
saying it's superior either, I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: saying one can't just have like a blanket,
uh, concession, you know, that indoor is
[SPEAKER_00]: superior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and certainly when it comes to
potency, I mean, that, itself is a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: hour, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, is 35% higher quality than
25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is, is that really how we look
at this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and obviously when you're making oil,
then that's not, or any kind of extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that's not even the thing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So higher potency to me is one of the
weaker arguments, you know, certainly,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, aesthetics are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, going back to what we were saying a
few minutes ago, you know, there is this
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum of growing environments and you
have people like, you know, Jeremy Moberg
[SPEAKER_00]: out, out there in the Eastern,
East of Washington growing in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't know the right word,
hoop houses or whatnot, getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, extraordinarily beautiful,
I think, you know, award winning,
[SPEAKER_00]: cosmetically flowers and, and I'm sure
many other, you know, people around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, some people,
uh, are very successful, but it is an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not as easy as most people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I think, you know, that's doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think also there is the baked
in assumption, you know, in what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, which is fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: That everyone wants to be able to grow it
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everyone grow pineapples everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everyone grow cranberries everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everyone grow kiwis everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everyone grow, you know, corn
everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I live on the Mendocino coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't grow fricking corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to build a greenhouse to
grow corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't really succeed at that
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is, there is a kind of swimming
against the tide there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did one of the many little calculations
in the paper was, uh, how much land area
[SPEAKER_00]: would it take to grow all of the cannabis,
you know, 24,000 tons roughly of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that Americans consume every year in the U
S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is 0.003%, three
thousandths of 1% of all U S farmland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we could clearly grow all
the cannabis that Americans want and it
[SPEAKER_00]: could all be, uh, you know, in almost,
you know, the ideal climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that's happening tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a whole hour about
interstate commerce and pros and cons of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, there is a kind of an implicit,
you know, requirement that it be grown
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that said, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there is outdoor cultivation in
every state and I don't, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaska, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, you know, what the best
producers in each state look like,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is a lot of room there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I don't, I'm not aware that anyone
has found like a medical element that is
[SPEAKER_00]: only achievable by indoor, but maybe
that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a need for medicine,
you know, these things are, are all
[SPEAKER_00]: nuanced, uh, in all spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and if there's a, really a need
that's demonstrated for indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, for some particular reason,
you know, then that should be looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: and supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes to what you were saying a
minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we do here and how do we make
that more efficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because also, you know, it's easy for me
to say, well, in a perfect world,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, this cultivation, more of this
cultivation would be outdoors than it is
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, remember a lot of
cultivation, not just at small,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, uh, artisanal scales,
but at industrial scales is outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know most of that's headed for oil,
but anyway, um, there's, which is a shame,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's really a shame that so
much of the outdoor is just air quotes,
[SPEAKER_01]: just headed for oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, oil is honorable, but,
but it's, it's, it's really amazing to me
[SPEAKER_01]: that people, um, treat outdoor as such a,
a, a mediocre commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: When, when I go down to California,
I'm only interested in finding Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California regenerative outdoor to
purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to put all this mass
produced indoor schlock on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it's really surprising that,
that the outdoor, what I consider the
[SPEAKER_01]: higher quality regenerative stuff is
discounted because people don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It astonishes me how that market dynamic
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly, you know, one,
uh, participant, in this whole ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: are the bud tenders and their level of
literacy or interest in the relative
[SPEAKER_00]: merits of the two in the carbon footprint,
uh, is, you know, small in almost all
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course there's no product labeling,
which is ironic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't many industries that have as
much product labeling the sense of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles and THC and, and, and,
uh, differentiation on cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't go to the market and,
and have all the different, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, types of corn labeled by
their cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, or, you know, there might be a little
bit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think consumer awareness, I mean,
we're getting away from the technical into
[SPEAKER_00]: the human and into the consumer level,
but, you know, consumers are not aware,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that one pre-roll emits,
you know, 5,000 times its weight in CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one pre-roll is like driving 65 miles
in the best plugin hybrid that's out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one pre-roll is as much of a carbon
footprint as 300 cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think things like that are,
are, you know, consumer awareness is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk a lot about free markets and
markets functioning well and not needing
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of those assumptions is that the
consumers have perfect information about
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and are making decisions with
the full visibility of their choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, uh, you know, we're,
we're straying from the quality issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's still, you know, it's
consumer choice, but there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: attributes and quality is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could also argue that the
environmental footprint is an element of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a given consumer could look at it that
way or they could not, but without knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is, you have no choice to weigh it
in.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't expect that they all ever
would, like, just like with everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, it's, you know, consumers are
not trying to optimize our planet for an
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you asked, uh, you know, you asked a
bit about, you know, lighting and then
[SPEAKER_00]: going beyond lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so let's say lighting is roughly
a third and your mileage may vary a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, you know, there's heating,
there's cooling, uh, dehumidification is
[SPEAKER_00]: huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the plants are of course
transpiring and releasing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're growing hydroponically,
uh, there's a lot of water coming out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, around the plant and that,
you know, obviously creates a big risk of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of mold and, and, uh, other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's dehumidification,
which is very energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, moving air,
you know, there can be 30, 40,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50, 60 air rotations in an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in an hour, you know, by, for
contrast, a house has like one or two or
[SPEAKER_00]: half of an air change per hour,
a lot of energy moving that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're irrigating, you're have
pumps, you're, uh, possibly treating that
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're possibly heating that water or even
cooling that water, depending what climate
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet down in Coachella Valley,
they have cooler, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: water chillers that are chilling the
irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if you have your own water
supply, you're pumping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so just as far as energy uses,
and then there's curing and then often
[SPEAKER_00]: there's extraction on the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, you know, there's a lot of
cold storage now in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, vast overproduction,
like vast overproduction in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more well documented in Canada than
here, but definitely happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that stuff, it's going into
refrigerators and freezers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just saying, like, it's,
it's back to the earlier point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no silver bullet, but all of these
things use energy and they all have energy
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manageable to a point and they should be,
you know, if they're used, they should be
[SPEAKER_00]: done as efficiently as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are some of the ones that are
in my numbers there for people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about, Oh, Evan's numbers are
too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a heck of a lot of things I left
out because there were no good data,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to include them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and there's a, uh, figure,
I think figure one in the paper that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of has this map of the, the whole kind of
carbon, uh, system, you know, around
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and which things I've been able
to quantify and which aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I haven't, but, you know,
on there's, you know, in energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, you know, managing your carbon
dioxide, there's UV disinfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things I couldn't include
odor removal, uh, not necessarily so much
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis, but, you know, another indoor
Ag, which I'm also studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's soil steaming and cleaning soil to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's recovering water out of
your air conditioning or your HVAC,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, exhaust stream, uh, in some climates,
there's snow melting again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more for other crops, but that
really happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you've got your infield farm equipment
talking about outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's data.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to use AI and robots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, this industry is
automating very rapidly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not at the small boutique grower
level, but where most of the cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: happenings and, and as we know,
you know, AI uses a lot of energy and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and mechanization uses energy and instead
of human labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the list kind of goes on,
but just to say, yes, there, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of other energy use besides lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the good news is that they all are
manageable to one degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or another in terms of, of energy
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one more question for you before
we go to the first break, Evan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that is, you know, you mentioned
early on, um, where moving from
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional lights to led lights is,
you know, it's, it's good to move in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right direction, but it doesn't really
move the needle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, you guys gave us a
healthy laundry list and we'll,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to dig into more of those
during the second set.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, you know, you gave us a laundry
list of all these other places that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, energy intensive in the indoor
cultivation zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if we went and got the energy
efficient version of all of these,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the energy efficient, you know,
water cooler and the energy efficient,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, lighting and the energy
efficient, um, you know, automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just went down the list and got
them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that move the needle or are we just
kidding ourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would, but it won't because yes,
you can kind of, uh, play God in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of specifying all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we haven't even talked about
solar yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you could make a zero
energy grow, but the, the obstacles to
[SPEAKER_00]: that, the, the resistance in the market
itself is enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the, the surveys, the market
surveys done of the growers say they want
[SPEAKER_00]: about a three year payback time on any
capital investments more than half of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them one to three year payback time or
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't, even though that's 33% of
return on your investment, I wish I could
[SPEAKER_00]: get that in the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's not going to get you far at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a big study that came out in
Canada and there's been a few that have
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to look, you know, we call it kind
of a techno economic studies, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how about this technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much does it cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much to save payback?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're getting numbers like,
you know, 10 to 20% energy savings
[SPEAKER_00]: potential in cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can't just pick lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, led is hard enough to get it to
pencil, but you know, you have to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: all these end uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, while there may be a
technical potential for, let's just say
[SPEAKER_00]: 75% energy savings, which is what I
stipulated in 2012 in the first paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, no one who is trying to earn a profit,
you know, who has investors is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: ever be able to get anywhere near that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and then with solar, the problem
is that the land use becomes untenable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm doing analysis now, uh,
it's looking like cannabis facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on climate and, um, location,
but it's like climate and facility type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, you know, people want
to grow in harsh climates, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they want to grow in their state
or in their town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be as bad or even worse than a
hundred times the roof area in solar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the best I've seen are like
20 times the roof area or maybe 10 times
[SPEAKER_00]: the roof area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of a sudden you're using more
land than you would be with outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and land sparing or land
savings is one of the top, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments that are used for indoor
agriculture more, more generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are these kind of real world
inconvenient, you know, constraints around
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, the industry is opposing,
not opposing, that's not fair,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, like the California energy
commission was putting out a public
[SPEAKER_00]: comment requests for energy efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standards on indoor grows and the industry
comes out of the woodwork with all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of opposition to it, you know,
and, and the uptake of LEDs still pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: low to be honest, you know, in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, uh, it's hard, you know,
it's got to be done willingly or ideally
[SPEAKER_00]: it's done willingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not done willingly,
then the regulators come in and people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want any more regulation on
cannabis, but they won't do it on their
[SPEAKER_00]: own enough, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it's, it's rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so I use the, the term optimizing
the suboptimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can optimize these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lord knows people are, I mean,
I'm not here to criticize and say the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LED look, their heat pumps are coming
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are, you know, trying to use AI and
things to optimize water application,
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize water use and therefore pumping
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their efforts are being made,
uh, but it's just, uh, you're not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so we're optimizing the,
the suboptimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much more elegant technologically
and economically to grow outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, if you can address the quality issue
and, and still do that sustainably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's plenty of inputs,
you know, to outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hold on up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm going to pick up on inputs in
the second set, but, but I want you to
[SPEAKER_01]: follow up on one thing before we go to
commercial, which is, uh, earlier in the
[SPEAKER_01]: set, I, I said, okay, if we, if we do,
if we change everything to the energy
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient version, will it move the
needle?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, and, and, and is,
is the technology in LED just not,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, up to the standard yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're about to, so we can just
research our way out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this same question about the solar
panels because, um, solar has always been
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my things that will save indoors in
my head, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, without being a solar nerd,
just hoping, hoping that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, do we see technological advances?
[SPEAKER_01]: That are coming down the pipe in research
that might be able to increase our
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wouldn't take 20 to 30 X the,
the roof space in solar panels to feed a
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation center or, or are,
are, are we not, um, for seeing that in
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind of immediate future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't, not in our lifetimes and
not, not even in a longer timeframe,
[SPEAKER_00]: not, not sufficient at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, LED is incredibly efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're still working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, solar is incredibly efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best panels are, you know,
there's been huge progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll continue, but it's not, it's not of
this, the magnitude that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got factors of 10 and
factors of a hundred improvements you need
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are other domains like
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, there I go, uh, genetics,
uh, cultivar, uh, huge differences,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, actually that figure five in the
paper shows just at the energy use for
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an area where you might get 50%
savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 50% increase, you know, depending where
you're moving between.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there, there's also a
broader array of possible things to do
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than changing one widget for
another, you know, in your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: process, uh, that, that's something to,
uh, you know, to, to look at.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and take a short break
and we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is energy and
environmental systems analyst,
[SPEAKER_01]: Evan Mills.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard me talk about the
award-winning cannabis seeds that come
[SPEAKER_01]: from the analytical breeding program of
Seth and Eric Crawford, who founded Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Seth was a guest on shaping fire
in 2020 to talk about triploid genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC
seeds for home growers and farms as grow
[SPEAKER_01]: the revolution seeds at gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their high THC seeds are extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that they will start to flower at 16
and a half hours of daylight instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: the typical 14 and a half hours of
daylight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means in most regions, your plants
will start to flower outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of July instead of the middle of
August, which means these photo period
[SPEAKER_01]: plants finish in September and not
October.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally upending the photo period seed
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth and Eric took their prized early
flowering CBG line and bred it to some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most desired variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: These crosses all express powerful photo
period terpene profiles and THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: giving you a great high.
[SPEAKER_01]: GTR seeds has a new THCV line with plants
like double Durbin and Gigantor that boast
[SPEAKER_01]: one-to-one THC to THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people want that THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: GTR seeds are very consistent,
true growing, inbred F1s from stabilized
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred parent lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: These seeds are nearly homogenous and the
plants should all grow the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is only one phenotype in every pack
available as diploids and triploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth and Eric's company is still family
owned, patient and employee centric and
[SPEAKER_01]: partially powered by their two acres of
solar panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone can purchase these seeds and the
entire catalog of Oregon CBD seeds at
[SPEAKER_01]: gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to gtrseeds.com today and choose
something revolutionary for your next
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor or outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Revenue is tight for cannabis businesses
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no question about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when revenue tightens, businesses need
to spend smarter on advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of throwing obscene money at
hanging your company's logo from the
[SPEAKER_01]: rafters at your next convention,
perhaps consider placing commercials on
[SPEAKER_01]: shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are a very small business,
there is simply no better bang for your
[SPEAKER_01]: buck than commercials on shaping fire,
especially if your products are for
[SPEAKER_01]: regeneratively minded people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_01]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from the
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable,
[SPEAKER_01]: and help our audience get in contact with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_01]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a commercial on shaping fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_01]: of their headphones right now,
and will continue to reach new listeners
[SPEAKER_01]: as they explore the shaping fire back
catalog of episodes again and again for
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A spot on shaping fire costs less than a
postcard per person, and the shaping fire
[SPEAKER_01]: audience is full of smart cannabis
enthusiasts, cultivators, and
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurs who are always curious to
learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now in the new year,
we are booking the few open spots we have
[SPEAKER_01]: for the rest of 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love for you to be one of our new
advertisers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today
for rates on podcast and Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Email hotspot at shapingfire.com to find
out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking to home growers, patients,
and commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI Seeds at
[SPEAKER_01]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb Inspekta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_01]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of his lineage and the hard-earned
experience that comes from growing up
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long-time heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb, also known as Inspekta and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle, is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_01]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew here on Vashon Island,
and everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_01]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_01]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is energy and environmental systems
[SPEAKER_01]: analyst, Evan Mills.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the last set,
we were talking about all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: places that energy usage can be tamped
down or stopped in an indoor cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have heard people push back before
Evan and say, we love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes life livable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you harassing cannabis cultivation
when there are so many other things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we should be harping on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's a logical fallacy there
because the fact that we should be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something about energy in a different
sector doesn't really say anything about
[SPEAKER_01]: not doing it in our sector, except for the
fact that we all love cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I bet you've heard this quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you say when people push back
like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I say that it's and and not or.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like there's 20 ways to save energy
in a house, there's also 20 ways to save
[SPEAKER_00]: energy in an economy or on a planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions by 90% or more on this planet to
[SPEAKER_00]: save ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't do that with one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that just going after cars or
steelmaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be taking every opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the you know, the dirty secret is that
cannabis is actually benefiting from a
[SPEAKER_00]: double standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's arguably one of the
last industries to come to energy
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency and sustainable energy,
because, you know, by virtue of the
[SPEAKER_00]: illicit market history, it hasn't been
exposed to or eligible for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: energy tax credits or energy education,
even or utility rebates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the you know, the stealthy nature of
it, you know, and the low capitalization
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't provide the money to invest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those days are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in California, where I
live, excuse me, in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I live, it's, you know, it's been a
quarter of a century since we've had,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, legal medical and since
cultivation has been done legally,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've had a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry's had a lot of time to figure
out how to do this well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are those are some thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it also matters in aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if this was a tiny, tiny amount
of energy, tiny, tiny, then, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be a priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've only got limited time,
limited money, but it's really stunning
[SPEAKER_00]: how big it is and how big it's become.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my since my 2012 study, the consumption
of cannabis in the United States has
[SPEAKER_00]: tripled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cultivation has tripled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even more than tripled for subtle
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the so the the energy use now because
I in the paper, you know, I look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: per square foot or per kilogram,
more importantly, you know, energies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I also look at the macro, the national
level and the carbon footprint now today,
[SPEAKER_00]: even including all these uses that I've
left out is equal to that of six million
[SPEAKER_00]: homes, six million average American homes,
10 million average American cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than than crypto mining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy to think that it's more than
crypto mining because we're all hearing
[SPEAKER_01]: about crypto mining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inputs and our cannabis is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's part of that double standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten less attention than it merits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not more, I would argue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that was stunning is
that it's four times the energy use of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing
sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so putting all other commentary and
things aside as a medicine, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that needs to be owned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that needs to be owned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's four times the food and beverage
industry, which manufacturing these are
[SPEAKER_00]: national statistics from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes beer and wine
production, food and beverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same as this one is stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's the same as all other outdoor
food crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can that be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, it is equal to all of the food crop
production in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an absurd comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, only one percent of the cannabis
carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is due to outdoor cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm doing my next papers on indoor
growing of cucumbers and tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce and all the other food products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a problem, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not nearly as bad as cannabis,
but they're, you know, hundreds of times
[SPEAKER_00]: more energy than outdoor lettuce
production, outdoor tomatoes and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just the energy intensity is so
extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And outdoor cultivation, you know,
it uses relatively little energy per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've got your tractors and your
water pumps and a lot of food doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: require, you know, drying or curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's lots of reasons why
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis is 300 times at least as much
energy as indoor lettuce is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a lot more energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and then for those are big,
like abstract numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're helpful because they're in
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the comparisons actually help
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then like to thicken that broth,
I also look at just to help this be
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible, you know, or put in
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about from the consumer perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned a little bit before about cars
and driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the different tiers of
consumers, obviously, so you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: daily or near daily user, which is like,
I don't know, 15 million people or
[SPEAKER_00]: something in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their carbon footprint, if they consume
just indoor grown at average US
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, outdoor grown, it's a
different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: They consumed indoor grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their carbon footprint from their cannabis
consumption is half of the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: footprint of their entire home,
meaning their fridge, their cooking,
[SPEAKER_00]: their heating and their cooling in average
US conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like three cross-country road trips
per year in a plug-in hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a hundred percent of their
annual food consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the energy footprint in
their other food, including meat eaters,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's roughly on par with the carbon
footprint of their food consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just talking about, you know,
a couple of grams, few grams, whatever a
[SPEAKER_00]: day of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not much better if you're a
healthy vegan or vegetarian, but it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the difference is even greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, it matters, you know,
and we can't, we have to do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an all hands on deck climate
emergency, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just need to look at everything
and it's not, you know, blaming and making
[SPEAKER_00]: bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, more in the spirit of what
you were saying before.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the inefficiencies and where can
we be more, you know, have a lower smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: footprint in this industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to pivot a bit until, to,
to start talking about post-harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: because like you said, we could spend
hours going through a detailed checklist
[SPEAKER_01]: of all of the different parts of
cultivation where we could strategize
[SPEAKER_01]: differently or use different technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, it's arguably just as ugly after
the flower has been dried and cured and is
[SPEAKER_01]: on its way out the door too.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that, you know,
I'm not, it's not like I'm the only one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but, but one of my big pet peeves are
dube tubes and the idea that we're,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're, you know, creating all these
plastics and future micro plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then if it's a, it's a,
if it's a really high end, maybe a,
[SPEAKER_01]: a hash infused or something pre-roll or
Kanagar, then, then they're adding extra
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're, they're adding plastic based
sticker and then like some kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, cool seal and, and then maybe even a
box around the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and it's like, there's only,
you know, there's only a grammar to a weed
[SPEAKER_01]: inside that joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's all this packaging to give it
vibe so that it sells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I, I imagine that the packaging
is just ugly in the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there isn't a new paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know out about that in, in particular,
and it's, you know, I looked at the solid
[SPEAKER_00]: waste streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of that is, is just plant
residue, but it's also, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: spent mineral wool and it's the plastics
for the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, I think 15 times the
weight of the flower or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just that solid waste part,
uh, you mentioned vape cartridges and the
[SPEAKER_00]: like, and you know, one thing that's,
uh, so sad there is that vapes have tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: lithium batteries in them and they go to
the landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lithium is recyclable and reusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a crisis in a lot of the,
you know, also the, uh, people on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you know, like to say that,
you know, lithium is hurting the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and electric cars are bad and
so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reality is we can recover and
reuse our lithium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that radically reduces the
environmental footprint of lithium,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't want to be sending it into
the landfills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are actually landfill fires that
are starting now because of all the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vape concentrations and probably other
lithium batteries too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there, if you Google lithium fires,
landfill, you'll, you'll find,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that that's happening, just saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're nice and evenly distributed
throughout the landfill, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think you, you missed a couple of
important ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's all this solid,
let's call it broadly solid waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the carbon footprint of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that's included in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's certainly other literature,
you know, as a whole discipline of looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at life cycle assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, uh, there's a kind of a gray zone
between cultivation proper and putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: on the truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's again, like I mentioned before,
refrigeration, curing, and also,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, downstream of that is extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a huge area that we know
almost nothing about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just hasn't been studied and written
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really tried to bring that into the
analysis and I think it will be coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people who are trying to do
more research on that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I did do one vignette that's in
the supporting appendix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my report you can get online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in the national numbers because I
don't know on scale, but I looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: supercritical CO2, which was the one
extraction process I could find
[SPEAKER_00]: information on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was stunning, um, about,
uh, the CO2 footprint from the extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: process was about 50 times the weight of
the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 50 kilograms of CO2 to the atmosphere
per kilogram of flour going into the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, um, that, you know, is about
actually it's more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 150 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at like, what is that as a
fraction of indoor footprint, it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% increase, 10% adder to the footprint
we are talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at outdoor, it's 30%
increase, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause outdoor is less, less carbon
intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are percentages, but it is arguably
an outdoor grower can make a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: marginal footprint on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, impact impact on their footprint
by improving that extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so many processes and we
don't know the national magnitudes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's something that's just crying out
for, uh, being looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not more important than the things
we're talking about, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I don't know if those are helpful
kind of conversations be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to address your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I would like us to move a little bit
further down the chain, um, to,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, so w it's grown and it's stored and it
is extracted and it is packaged all things
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've hit on so far, but let's,
let's pick it up from that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, uh, at this point we're in
transportation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you pick up the storyline
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, it's harder to look at
transportation because again, data,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one thing vexing this whole
process is there's no, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a result of national criminalization
and whatever else where funding is,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, there's not nearly as good a data
on cannabis industry as there are on other
[SPEAKER_00]: industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and of course, part of that problem
is also the industry itself, not sharing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, its data, but you know,
there are, there are numbers out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do look at that in the paper and
it's, uh, you know, there's lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: transportation going on right through the
whole life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's upfront transportation in
the building of the facility, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the delivery of all the inputs,
the fertilizers, the, the plastics,
[SPEAKER_00]: the clones, the whatever, uh, and then
there's people working and coming to and
[SPEAKER_00]: fro there's landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things are broken out,
you know, in the report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like you said, at the end,
of course it goes into a distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, some people have complained about
the regulatory landscape, making this
[SPEAKER_00]: worse because cannabis and this is going
to vary, you know, by state, by
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdiction, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more times you have to move it
because of chain of, not chain of custody,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like the way the, the, uh,
stewardship, you know, is, is dictated,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, it may have to go to, to one level of
distribution and then to another and
[SPEAKER_00]: certain, uh, processes in the,
in the, uh, product life cycle are
[SPEAKER_00]: separated to different locations,
whatnot, but there's transportation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like one, one emerging thing that I
just mentioned, but there's no,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I couldn't get a handle on it
with numbers is a door to door delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you want to really look,
you know, at the whole ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to look at how it reaches
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, certainly door to door delivery
is increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the net effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can argue, uh, that it might
save some energy and certainly it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to defray some consumer trips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's a lot of talk now
about the faster that people want their
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery, the more carbon footprint there
is because they send single items out in a
[SPEAKER_00]: giant truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've all had the
experience with Amazon and you order
[SPEAKER_00]: something and it's at your door the next
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means, you know, there were a lot
of inefficiencies in getting that to your
[SPEAKER_00]: door because they're not, they're not
moving goods, large amounts of goods in
[SPEAKER_00]: one trip to one zip code.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're racing around with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One piece of data you dropped that
astonished me was that home delivery is
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% of cannabis sales now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you know, I, I, I've never had
delivery, not that I wouldn't have it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I live on, on an island that's small
in the Puget Sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, but, but I was astonished that
there's so much of it just being
[SPEAKER_01]: delivered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and you know, I kind of,
I kind of simmered on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, so the, the cannabis store
is setting, sending somebody to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me with my cannabis, but, but in the old
days I used to go to the house of my
[SPEAKER_01]: dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one way or another, somebody had to
drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, I can see how we put this on
the industry as a whole, but to be fair,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't think we should,
we need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be fair to put that on indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to be careful in saying,
what is the net effect of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you have to look at the net effect
and you know, the, the, what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative and is that more or less
carbon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but again, if something, you know,
if you're taking a 2000 pound car to
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver, you know, an eighth somewhere,
and that's your only trip that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: making as opposed to a person who's
ideally integrating that with some other
[SPEAKER_00]: trip, then there's obviously a difference,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also just a small correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that 50%, that's a thought experiment
in the paper to see, well, what effect
[SPEAKER_00]: would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would, if we got to 50%,
we don't know what share, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what share somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a good clarification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of scenarios in the paper
that the, uh, the policy scenarios and the
[SPEAKER_00]: market scenario is saying, well,
what if the market evolved in this way or
[SPEAKER_00]: that way, good or bad, just how much do
certain things move the needle?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one, like if 50% of sales were
eventually conveyed by delivery services,
[SPEAKER_00]: total emissions would go up by about 4%,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the total carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't, you know, the big knob at all,
but we just have to look at all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and also like which ones are big and
which ones are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to do that is to go
through, you know, exercises like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So delivery is not in my study in the,
in the numbers, because we don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, how much of it's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, how much is saved by,
uh, what the difference is between
[SPEAKER_00]: individual consumers going and getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or of course, there's the whole home
cultivation part of this as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is its whole, you know, separate
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's included in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and there, you know, you save a lot
of emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the, if I'm remembering right,
the home cultivation is about half the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor cultivation is something like half
the carbon footprint of, of industrial,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is you, you know,
you have less transportation going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you have, you know, you're not
landfilling things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's an interesting spin,
Evan, that I did not pick up my first time
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's actually a decent, I,
you know, I live in Washington where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not allowed home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like one of the only people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, the, the fact that it
never occurred to me that, that indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: individual home, you know, a four by four
tent home grow is going to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient for my own cannabis needs than
it is for me to buy it from, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: from a store and all the extra energy
that's used by that cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually just compare it the,
the indoor that I would buy at the store
[SPEAKER_01]: versus my outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea that my indoor, um,
is more energy efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It surprises me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tease that out a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's be sure to say can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The devil's always in the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, uh, and, and still from my
numbers, it's still about half the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: footprint, which is still 2000 times its
weight in CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, keep it in perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there we go back to your
conversations like, well, what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so this is something
ostensibly that would make a big dent in
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but you're still left with a problem,
you know, that's extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the reasons are, you know,
not everybody's air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's less volume, you know,
these indoor grows, as you see,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the big pictures,
the industrial ones, they're incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: voluminous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're, you know, you're not just
lighting plants, you're heating and
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling and dehumidifying, you know,
giant volumes of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, you know, it also depends on the
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if, you know, you're using a heat
pump at home and the, indoor grow or
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse is using gas heating,
that's at 80% efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, that makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you don't have the interdiction or at
least to the same level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, interdiction, I mean,
there's a lot of work upfront in this
[SPEAKER_00]: paper of looking at how much has grown
versus how much makes it to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what doesn't make it to the
market, I'm not really changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: subject, but you know, it's a part of this
indoor grown thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's colorful, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you have to take,
all the energy used to cultivate and
[SPEAKER_00]: divide that by the energy, by the quantity
of cannabis consumed at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to count all the energy,
whether it ends up in a given consumer's
[SPEAKER_00]: product or not, because that's CO2 to the
atmosphere and it's energy being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you've got so many forms
of loss, uh, including at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you lose a crop because you're,
you're not skilled, you know, and all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden you're four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's full of mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just wasted, you know, 60 days of,
of electricity to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, you know, there's like the
product testing, which again, I'm not,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not against, but product testing
results in destroyed cannabis and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not product testing when you grow at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, the transportation, some of the
transportation involved, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary being lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a small contri... Oh,
that was a nice pun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some factors, uh,
not everyone has to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't have the large amounts
of moisture all being concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you dry it in your shower and you
don't have showers off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you don't have, you know, an electric
drying, uh, environment with dehumidifiers
[SPEAKER_00]: running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's, those are the kinds of
reasons why it seems like the home
[SPEAKER_00]: footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're not going to landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the laws that require,
and, you know, I'm not, the laws that
[SPEAKER_00]: require landfilling also increase carbon
emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very small, very, very small,
but I had to calculate it and just look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you put a lot of biomass under
the ground, especially if you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, wet, you know, soaked mineral wool
full of, full of, uh, uh, uh, fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: residues and roots and so on, you get
methane, you know, and that's a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: gas and landfills are not, not catching
all the methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, that's not happening with,
with, uh, home cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as long as you compost it and it
doesn't go anaerobic, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an interesting thing you said
about interdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, raising the, uh,
the energy consumption of overall cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: because, um, they're like, Hey,
it was, it was grown and, and if they just
[SPEAKER_01]: take it and let it mold in some closet
somewhere, um, that, that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting, it's not meeting needs in the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, they're essentially letting
electricity usage mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so interdiction is not good for
the environment is a catchy idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just, uh, electricity,
it's the fossil fuel, but it's also,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also all the, but, and beyond energy,
it's all the other inputs, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to make the fertilizers and
build the facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to allocate all that
energy somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, and the same token, uh,
you know, product contamination,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the responsibility of the growers
results in destruction of product when
[SPEAKER_00]: that's intercepted and overproduction is a
gigantic problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not, you know, the,
the, the, uh, you know, the government's
[SPEAKER_00]: fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are probably certain ways to
blame the public sector on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, but when you overproduce and it
doesn't get to market, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, Canada is destroying, you know,
thousands of tons of cannabis every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just because they're overproducing
and you can't keep it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than a year or so it loses THC and
the CBD profile changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that's a whole separate
conversation of why is this overproduction
[SPEAKER_00]: happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm no expert in it, but I,
I'm observing it and I have not folded
[SPEAKER_00]: that into the study because we don't know
how much of that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look, there's a lot of it
discussed in the appendix of the paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of specific numbers and examples and
industry reports and it's giant amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you, you have to look
at, you know, there's a lot of reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: that more is grown than is consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then product recalls, you know,
is something that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it's happening much,
which is arguably a problem, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, but it's not, uh, that's not,
again, a giant two digit effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's just one of, you know,
it's an example of how to think about the
[SPEAKER_00]: gross production versus the net
consumption and who, where that energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions burden gets allocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it brings us to an interesting
point about legalization, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a question that is everyone
wants to ask as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does legalization at the national scale
solve a climate problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can talk about that now or later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing it does avoid is the
interdiction product destruction part of
[SPEAKER_00]: this puzzle, which again is a minor effect
on the overall footprint, but it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: trivial one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come back to that during the third
set.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to finish off this second set with,
um, a, uh, a short discussion on,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, fertilizers, um, specifically,
um, on shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are always teaching, um, wild crafts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, using, um, local inputs,
um, you know, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, of course we're,
we're, we're encouraging people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to coax them away,
uh, from, uh, synthetics and A plus B
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers and petroleum derivatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, this, this kind of,
uh, synthetification of, of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers and, um, and, and,
and certainly there is some, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: energy usage with, uh, regenerative as
well as, you know, it's still getting
[SPEAKER_01]: packaged some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still being shipped in most cases,
not everybody's wild crafting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so some of that is same between the
both, but, but, but, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I have an assumption that most of this,
uh, regenerative, um, soil amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: because they are often in the form that
they were in nature, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe we need to crush the craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, um, you know, building an A
plus B fertilizer profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just going to like supercharge the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm wondering how did, how did
those compare the, the, the, the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs specifically that are related to
nutrition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would refer your, um, your listeners
to the, the widely talked about article by
[SPEAKER_00]: Haley Summers and her colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Colorado a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that was the first real serious
so-called life cycle assessment of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis where they went through,
you know, ammonium nitrate and triple
[SPEAKER_00]: super phosphate and potassium chloride and
other soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, uh, uh, neem oil and
fungicides and other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did all that math and,
uh, I baked that into the work I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the way that comes out,
and by the way, let's talk about carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide, which is actually the largest
single part of the non cultivation energy
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another input.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have that carbon dioxide is made
industrially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to hear about like citing
grows next to breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do that here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it if you can, but we're just,
we're not going to have anhyzer bush,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, putting cannabis grows next
to all it's, uh, crappy beer factories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, so they, I've got my spreadsheet,
uh, spun up while you were asking me this
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, in this study, the carbon
footprint from all these inputs that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just rattled off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also there's the mineral wool,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Melted freaking rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so there's a lot of carbon and because
there's a lot of energy in spinning
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral wool into these cubes that are
used once and are generally not recyclable
[SPEAKER_00]: and go straight to landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's actually the second largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's other ones that other
soil amendments are more important,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at any rate, the, um, so if you look
at the inputs as a, as a percentage,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a ratio to the energy carbon for
cultivation, the inputs add are about a
[SPEAKER_00]: third more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the whole ball of wax,
all the transportation, everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 20% of all the national emissions
from cannabis are from the inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually also averaging together
indoor and outdoor and all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certain sub-slices might be,
uh, might be more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does matter, but bottom line,
it certainly matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, um, you know, and again,
you're also sending stuff to landfill
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's other reasons that,
you know, better than I do of why closing
[SPEAKER_00]: these loops can, can really help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to be sure not to make
methane in your compost pile, because then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're really shooting yourself in the
foot if it goes anaerobic, cause it,
[SPEAKER_00]: methane's an extremely potent,
um, greenhouse gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but like I said, the biggest,
the biggest problem is CO2 and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's the biggest single additional
carbon footprint, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: element beyond the, the energy itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The creation of these, uh, petroleum based
fertilizers, I must admit, I don't exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: know how they are, um, made because
they've just never been attracted to me or
[SPEAKER_01]: attractive to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, how does that fertilizer creation
process compare with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the regenerative way of just collecting
natural items to mix into our soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's above my pay grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my specialty, but it's,
it, there's a lot of literature out there
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and there's a lot of fossil
fuel and you know, the, the making of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate, you know, in particular is a,
is known to be, you know, very energy
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you that there is a rich area for
study down that rabbit hole too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and take our second
commercial break.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we come back in set three,
um, I want to talk more about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: perspectives, um, that are needed in,
in some of them that you mentioned during
[SPEAKER_01]: the first set, which I found to be very
valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, uh, you are listening to shaping
fire and my guest today is, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: energy and environmental systems analyst,
Evan Mills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, without these advertisers,
shaping fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_01]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack that can be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so many varieties in one pack is a
sign of an immature seed line that hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: been worked enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer my auto flowers to be worked
enough that each pheno in the pack really
[SPEAKER_01]: captures the aspects that the breeder was
intending.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I recommend gnome automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_01]: automatic flowering cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gnome automatic seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_01]: recognizable by its traits, traits that
were hard earned so that you can have your
[SPEAKER_01]: best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last 10 years, gnome automatics
founder, Dan Jimmy has become a trusted
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder and he continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_01]: variety he releases for you to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the gnome automatics Instagram
at gnome underscore automatics to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can score gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_01]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercial cannabis farms across the
country love growing gnome automatics
[SPEAKER_01]: because of their consistency from seed to
seed, short grow times, THC percentages,
[SPEAKER_01]: and colorful bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farms interested in bulk seeds of more
than a thousand should reach out through
[SPEAKER_01]: gnomeautomatics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: While on the website, be sure to check out
the gnome automatics shirts and other
[SPEAKER_01]: merch section too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want reliable seeds, hand built
from effort, expert selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: and experience, choose gnome automatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an all
natural fish poop concentrate with nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real fish poop is extraordinarily complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only are you adding the nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium your plants need
[SPEAKER_01]: to build mass, transport nutrients,
and enhance flavor, but fish waste is also
[SPEAKER_01]: packed with biological activity and
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add fish poop to your irrigation
water, you are adding life force,
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotics, and active microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These microorganisms include a wealth of
various bacteria and protozoa which
[SPEAKER_01]: further enhance nutrient availability for
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plants are limited by the absence
of any essential micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_01]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop is a naturally complete solution
that fills in the cracks in your
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer program to ensure you offer
your garden a broad base of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all fish poop is created equally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most products with added fish waste don't
reveal their sources or lab results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fish poop, however,
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_01]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_01]: koi and tilapia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are even invited to tour their farm in
person or on their YouTube channel to look
[SPEAKER_01]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sort of transparency is wildly rare
in the fertilizer market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks behind fish poop are also
lifelong medical cannabis producers who
[SPEAKER_01]: have deep connections in the community,
donate more product than they sell,
[SPEAKER_01]: and support cannabis prisoner,
veteran, and patient collectives and
[SPEAKER_01]: charities.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get your bottle of pure fish poop,
go to fishpoop.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see their entire line of cannabis
products, go to ounceofhope.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fish poop brand fish poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the topics I wanna share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has follow-up
posts to Shaping Fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shango Lowe's Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_01]: my successes and failures in my own
garden, insights and best practices from
[SPEAKER_01]: personal grows everywhere, and always
gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Lowe's and join our
[SPEAKER_01]: online community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Lowe's,
and my guest today is energy and
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental systems analyst,
Evan Mills.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Evan, you know, I have had to hold
myself as host several times during the
[SPEAKER_01]: show because I have gone my whole life
defending cannabis from people who wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell me it was a drug with no medical
use and people who said I shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: around it because of the law, and then
people who are telling me that we
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't grow it because I don't have a
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, it's one thing after
another where I have been trying,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of those with me, right,
all of my cannabis family, we're all so
[SPEAKER_01]: used to defending cannabis and defending
ourselves and defending our rights and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get people to understand that
this herb is healing of the mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: soul, and body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so talking about cannabis in the way
that we have today, I'm also pro the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, but I also am naturally kind
of knee-jerky wanting to just defend
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that part of the big shift
that has to happen is messaging to come
[SPEAKER_01]: through for people to understand that we
can still love cannabis, swear by it,
[SPEAKER_01]: defend it, and also be responsible for the
energy usage that our favorite plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: using and, you know, unfortunately the
poor way that it's being implemented
[SPEAKER_01]: bureaucratically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think at the core of it,
somehow those of us who love it need to
[SPEAKER_01]: split from identifying the cannabis as
ourselves and instead understand that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: time for us to work with the plant in a
way so that we're not abusing the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment to get the part of it that we
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just answered your own question
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next question?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, give it your own context.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've set that up really well and
rationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, you know, I grew up,
I was born in 1960.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in the fabled Laurel Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to go as to Cheech and Chong's kids
Halloween parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Northern California now in the
Redwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an organic gardener, not of cannabis,
but of, you know, I love my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not against the plant or against,
you know, people who want to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Henry Ford, one of his, you know,
many famous quotes was, everything can
[SPEAKER_00]: always be done better than it is,
be done better than it's done now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of what leads to
innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, you know, this guy,
and you know, earlier you were asking how
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights can be done better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a valid thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is something that's being chased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think just having the attitude of,
let's be creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be smarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be sure we're current.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not let our protectiveness,
you know, I was listening to another
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and the guy was in the industry
and he was opposing interstate transport
[SPEAKER_00]: because he wanted to protect his local
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a free country,
at least for the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just you have to be, you know,
think big, you know, think about the big
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we really want to oppose interstate
commerce to protect with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: without any kind of counterweight to it,
because that's potentially going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: an energy, you know, and climate
consequences are worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that's helpful,
but, you know, those are some,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, some thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry is also, to be honest,
starting to do some of this on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at, like there's been some years
now, you know, canopy growth in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: closed gigantic indoor warehouses and
transitioned, you know, to greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's more and more
greenhouse coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's been one of the big changes
since the 2012 study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously at that point there was,
you know, very little of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, prodigious, you know,
300,000 square foot, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are no panacea and it's too bad
that they have the word green in their
[SPEAKER_00]: name because they use a lot of
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them use a lot of electric
lighting and still the artificial,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fossil based inputs and all of that,
but there is less energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of optimization
potential there for sure in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: type, you know, daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're using daylight in our
buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a whole science around
daylighting for humans and making more use
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the potential for that pales compared
to, you know, the cannabis potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting smarter with greenhouses,
I think is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lose so much energy and they're
almost always heated with natural gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's more the convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why do you have all this glass facing
north and on and on, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are people out there who are,
you know, have been working not just in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis space, but in indoor ag more
generally to try to optimize greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the cost of, I guess one
thing I would add is that there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: enlightened self-preservation argument
here too, because, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Northern California, the growers
used to call our local electric utility,
[SPEAKER_00]: PG&E, their 20% partner, because they were
paying 20% of their revenues to PG&E for
[SPEAKER_00]: their monthly energy bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's become a huge issue with
profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would argue at some paper I haven't
written yet, but I think the bankruptcies
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're seeing in the cannabis space
are often tracing back not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: solely, but in significant part to the
energy spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you spend a lot of money upfront
for all the capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these lighting systems,
these HVAC systems, and then if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to be green and putting in solar on
top of that and water recovery from your
[SPEAKER_00]: waste air stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's because, and then you operate and
you're spending millions of dollars a
[SPEAKER_00]: month can be on energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a real pain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in part, industry is
discovering this kind of the hard way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would hate to see a big boom and
bust where we have all these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: abandoned warehouses with all this
equipment that nobody else needs in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so- The boom and bust, I think is on
the menu for California, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: already happening, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that we see this better in other
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And earlier in this last run of words,
you had mentioned that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the things that the industry is
doing to improve and it's really startling
[SPEAKER_01]: how low the bar is for a lot of the folks
to make an impression.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you know, I was down in
California as I often am, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I picked up some regenerative
cannabis flower from Soul Spirit Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just, I was overjoyed and made
an Instagram a post because they use
[SPEAKER_01]: compostable dupe tubes and some kind of
compostable paper ink, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for their boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just floored to see something
that existing because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I go into places all across the country
and I've not seen anybody do that that
[SPEAKER_01]: actively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I am overjoyed and, you know,
all love and support to Soul Spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to see that from just one
farm, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to see that with an entire States
moving in this generation or in this
[SPEAKER_01]: general direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also curious earlier during second
set, you talked about some inherent market
[SPEAKER_01]: bias towards indoor that wasn't coming
from the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to hit on that before we
wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you kind of color that in for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'd like to hear those points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty interesting and
disheartening to dig in a bit to like how
[SPEAKER_00]: the market's working in the regulatory
sphere and other aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that we see here in California and
it's probably true in other States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's true in other States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that we see here in
California, varying by state, is that some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the legislation defers to, well,
first of all, some of the legislation,
[SPEAKER_00]: like for a while, Illinois was only
allowing indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, the legalization,
the recreational stage, left it to,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was legalized statewide, but it left it
to the jurisdictions, meaning counties and
[SPEAKER_00]: cities, to color in what the policies were
going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And half of California by land area
forbids outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't make it illegal because the
state allows it to be legal, but they can
[SPEAKER_00]: force it to only be indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one can have a conversation about why
in the world that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the municipality level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it could be city or county.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a distortion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have this whole world of
financial incentives, and I'm the first
[SPEAKER_00]: person to defend and argue for financial
incentives for energy efficiency and
[SPEAKER_00]: renewables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically think of them as utility
rebates for better LED lighting in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, but there can be- Yeah,
rebates for sun grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put your finger on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead, you see, I mean,
you Google around, you'll see growers
[SPEAKER_00]: being handed these large table-sized
cardboard checks for a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: For putting in LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, maybe, but what you're doing is
you're subsidizing them to a large degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these are giant rebates and you're
making their product even more competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: to outdoor grown, to sun grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like feeding the wrong solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so imagine if indoor, sorry,
if outdoor producers were, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: if current indoor producers were given an
incentive like that to not get 10% energy
[SPEAKER_00]: savings, but to get 99% energy savings by
shifting to outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that million dollar check should
go to them and at least level that playing
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have no subsidies if you don't like
subsidies or make it fair and reward all
[SPEAKER_00]: the good behavior and not just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think lastly, there's this
issue of cities and the trend towards
[SPEAKER_00]: urban cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may notice because you're in the
industry, but the average person driving
[SPEAKER_00]: around in a neighborhood with warehouses
doesn't realize that there's a Walmart
[SPEAKER_00]: sized warehouse that they're driving by
that's all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're there for sometimes the wrong
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being given sweetheart deals on
their taxes or lower fees, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cities want them there because the
cities are getting local taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And local permit free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a conflict of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't pretend to know how often
that's weighing things, but the cities
[SPEAKER_00]: have a conflict of interest in wanting the
cannabis facilities there, which kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: by definition have to be indoors if
they're in the urban fabric in this world,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're blowing up their carbon
footprint at the same time by drawing
[SPEAKER_00]: these entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are outdoor growers from
California who've moved to Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes these growers get on a
jag and they blow out the utility
[SPEAKER_00]: transformers and they bring in diesel
generators to run their grows in these low
[SPEAKER_00]: income, environmentally overburnt areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm getting off track from your
question, but it's the urbanization of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Denver's got 200 factory scale grows
in the core of Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland has about 200 in their so-called
green zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we can do better in that the
regulators have a role to play in leveling
[SPEAKER_00]: the playing field and not throwing
obstacles in front of industry doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned interstate commerce earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've all been joking since the early
medical days that it's kind of California
[SPEAKER_01]: versus everybody, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you want to have a cannabis
company in your state, you need to get up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to get efficient and you need to
lock in your customer base before
[SPEAKER_01]: interstate sales is allowed because
California is going to eat everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot to be said for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a lot of challenges to be
said for that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've looked at the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you see in your crystal ball
as far as the impact of interstate
[SPEAKER_01]: commerce on the overall energy consumption
for the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been able to put numbers on that
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just not enough data, but there's
a long discussion in the paper about how
[SPEAKER_00]: to think about it and all the kind of
unexpected countervailing factors there
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much we would save or how much we
wouldn't save.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, as you mentioned,
California's the big gorilla and you think
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the cannabis already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think California produces like
three times as much cannabis as
[SPEAKER_00]: Californians consume, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that's going to other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: California is one of the cleaner states
because we have a clean grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you do the thought experiment
and say, well, now we have interstate
[SPEAKER_00]: commerce and we're going to save all this
carbon by having more local production,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to subtract that you may just be
bringing in the same cannabis that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: now on the legal side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, I think there's so much of the
US that's suitable for low carbon outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interstate commerce is an obstacle to
that and being able to flow everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't put numbers on it for you,
but it's a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did look at legalization more broadly,
kind of adjacent to the question you're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking, how much carbon might that save in
its own right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's rather small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to model, difficult to
think through, but basically the big
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit of legalization is less landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, there's more landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an offsetting effect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because mandated landfill happens in the
legal market, not in the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some ways in which it can
increase emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the packaging is one that you
mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one new paper says there's more
packaging in regulated markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the illicit market and in
pre-regulated markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also on the upside, from legalization,
you're taking the interdiction out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all that cannabis that's destroyed
and all that embodied energy and carbon is
[SPEAKER_00]: in principle, in a rarefied case,
not happening anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something like an 8% reduction in
national carbon footprint from
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that said, legalization is kind of a
necessary, but not sufficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: milepost on the route to all kinds of
other policies, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't incentivize better practices in
an illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, right now, about a little more
than half of the national carbon footprint
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the illicit market and a little less
than half is in the legal market,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot to address still on the
other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting how that comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily obvious that it would
break down like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much more of the production is in the
illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the illicit market has a much
larger share of outdoor than the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: market does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of why even though 75%,
80% of the production is in the illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: side nationally, the carbon footprints are
more 50-50-ish because there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor in the illicit side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to wrap us up here, we have given folks
a whole lot of data points and
[SPEAKER_01]: perspectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of them, they're lubricated
and they've got pivot points and they
[SPEAKER_01]: depend on these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very much a complex web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you address this, then the other
part moves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's distill this down to some,
I don't know, marching orders or a loving
[SPEAKER_01]: suggestion is probably a little less
authoritarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the two key groups who we're
talking to now, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously we'd have a lot to say
for the politicians, but they're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: not still listening to the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who are listening are cannabis
consumers and the cannabis business
[SPEAKER_01]: owners, the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's take the business first and
then we'll talk to the consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if an indoor cultivator, and they've
got their heart in the right place and
[SPEAKER_01]: they have just heard our conversation,
and they're like, damn, I think that at
[SPEAKER_01]: the very least I need to start doing stuff
to decrease my energy consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be better for the company and it'll
be better for the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to help there be a planet for
my kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're heading their hearts in the
right place, but they already have an
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what would you give to them as the
first steps on a path that are attainable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good, good questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say, I've had a lot of
emails and things from producers over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years and more than a handful have said
they've changed their business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've looked at this and over time
they've shifted their industry towards
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and then outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a strategic longer term way,
there's no shame in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that's done all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look at the large industries
and they're definitely shifting their
[SPEAKER_00]: center of gravity from indoor towards
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that, the longer term,
I think, a nearer term, look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the energy audits, really look at your
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about, I don't want to say greedy,
but maximizing yield, is it everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Run numbers more carefully because maximum
yield isn't necessarily maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive to push across and I'm not
pretending I know more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators who've spent their
professional lives dialing this in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but be sure you've got good info,
good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think twice at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think twice about your current practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about Henry Ford and how you can do
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's as a near term about as
good as we can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how about the consumer then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the consumer, it's interesting
because the consumer is both the most
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful and the least powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at the end of the long chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to influence any of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because it's all being made for us,
it actually does empower us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I definitely don't think that
consumers are using their power at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you say to us as consumers
about some kind of action we can take to
[SPEAKER_01]: move the percentages in the right
direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the consumer doesn't realize
their power as in so many cases,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy, climate more broadly and all kinds
of other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think talk to your budtender,
ask questions, be curious, ask for data on
[SPEAKER_00]: the different products, make it known that
it matters to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consumers can change their behavior
and that changes the market and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers it sounds like yourself,
you know, who prefers ungrown and hunt for
[SPEAKER_00]: the product that's just right for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, I mean, I don't think it's even
necessary, but come down a notch in
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, whatever it's just, or make
quality part of your definition of,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, make environment part of your
definition of quality, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't seem like a stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what is quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is quality of life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't part of quality of life being,
you know, not having our homes burned in
[SPEAKER_00]: wildfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, you know, so I think the
consumers, you know, being aware and
[SPEAKER_00]: educating themselves and it's hard,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's very little information out
there for them and it's not being provided
[SPEAKER_00]: by industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also being aware of greenwashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of greenwashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I have a page on my site
that your listeners are welcome to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: with examples of the greenwashing that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't be on the consumer to
root that out and clean that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, there aren't really
regulators, you know, going after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a problem for consumers is even
like the notion of terroir, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, so we've got cannabis grown in a
windowless factory, not in soil with no
[SPEAKER_00]: sun, no rain in California, in Arcata,
you know, and it's called Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe there's something there that I'm
not understanding, you know, I guess the
[SPEAKER_00]: water, but the water has been so heavily
treated by the time it gets there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's something for consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and back to the producers
for a second, I think another thing they
[SPEAKER_00]: can do is, I mean, it's under this banner
of being curious and inquisitive and also
[SPEAKER_00]: forthcoming, you know, share data,
work with researchers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: benchmark your carbon footprint against
your competitors and see like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how am I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause benchmarking is a really powerful
tool to see, well, what are other people?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the best practices out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, go for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of documentation on best
practices within indoor, within
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's something to do and
consider product labeling, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing better, you know,
then get the word out there and work with
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensaries and work with these,
the value chain to get transparency for
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if consumers are asking for it and
producers are pushing it, then consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: will start to be more informed about,
you know, about carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that everyone,
you know, all the actors from the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators to the growers, to the
consumers could do more in cause it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pitiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's just, there's such an
information vacuum facing everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all from soup to nuts there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, Evan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we easily could have done a
couple more hours on this topic,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we, you know, the goal was not to
inundate people too much, but to really
[SPEAKER_01]: illustrate to folks, you know,
how tenacious energy consumption is all
[SPEAKER_01]: through the chain and to start having us
think about it, whether our end goal is to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually get outside or to just decrease
our electrical usage in our present
[SPEAKER_01]: operation as step one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is, you know, it's an
honorable pursuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though we don't want to look at
anything that is, you know, chastising of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's damn time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for giving of your
personal time to join us today on shaping
[SPEAKER_01]: fire and to, to share your like wildly in
