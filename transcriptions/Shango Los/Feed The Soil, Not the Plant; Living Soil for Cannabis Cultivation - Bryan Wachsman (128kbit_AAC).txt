[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to
the 1130 presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Shango Los, the host of Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoy learning from top folks in
the cannabis industry, I encourage you to
[SPEAKER_00]: check out shapingfire.com, where my
podcast is located, to enjoy in-depth
[SPEAKER_00]: interviews about cannabis business,
health, and technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we've got a pretty popular YouTube
channel that serves a half million minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: of exclusive cannabis content every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the videos that I recorded,
like, went like this when I'm hosting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in fact, Brian's presentation today
will be on the YouTube channel sometime
[SPEAKER_00]: next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out if you like to hear smart
folks talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we will be hearing from Brian
Walksman from Green Farms LLC and Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian is a cannabis cultivation specialist
and educator for Green Farms LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a lifelong proponent of clean green
growing techniques and he spends his time
[SPEAKER_00]: educating all levels of growers,
from small home growers to large
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial cannabis operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, Brian's going to be presenting Feed
the Soil, Not the Plant, an introduction
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis cultivation using living
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for Brian.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, guys, and I really appreciate
you coming and listening to me speak.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of fantastic speakers today,
so I'm honored that you guys would come
[SPEAKER_08]: and hear about living soils.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually a huge advocate of shaping
Shango's podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned a lot from those.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of guys, Keep It Simple
Organics, Adam Dunn, BrownGuy420.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple of just well-known guys
out there with podcasts, including Mr.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shango Los that I really think is
beneficial for you guys to listen to as
[SPEAKER_08]: well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then of course, they're all free.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I started growing cannabis 10 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been cultivating living soils for
four years and I've been educating about
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis for two years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I started out growing cannabis using an
aeroponic machine.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was using house and garden nutrients,
bottled nutrients, just really A and B
[SPEAKER_08]: type basic stuff, adding the amendments,
the shooting powder, and all the things
[SPEAKER_08]: that house and garden makes you think that
you need to use.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I started to educate myself about the
pesticides that were being used and I got
[SPEAKER_08]: a job as a commercial cultivator in
Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I quickly found out is that nobody
checked what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my boss was having me spray Avid,
Forbid, Eagle 20, and these things caught
[SPEAKER_08]: up with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to point out that this is my
old company about five years ago and this
[SPEAKER_08]: is how much these guys got in trouble for
batch violations.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are all batch violations in Denver,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the guys out in California,
not really the guys here in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you spray Myclobutanol, you are going
to fail and you are probably going to lose
[SPEAKER_08]: your company.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is vital that some of these
techniques that I'm going to talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: today and some of the other speakers that
are here today, if you can find a way to
[SPEAKER_08]: grow cannabis using beneficial bugs,
beneficial predator mites, you're going to
[SPEAKER_08]: be ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I started my living soil research
through Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I learned about Jeff Loewenfels and
then I started to incorporate those
[SPEAKER_08]: techniques into my own personal grow,
try to get my skill set back up.
[SPEAKER_08]: To where it needs to be growing cannabis
using a living soil instead of synthetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once I started to hone those
skills, I started to kind of make a little
[SPEAKER_08]: name for myself in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: People really started to like the cannabis
that I was growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was educating around and then I was
picked up by Green Farms last year in
[SPEAKER_08]: October of 2017.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I educate all around the country
and I'm a huge proponent for just trying
[SPEAKER_08]: to get the home grower to understand that
they can grow for pennies on the dollar
[SPEAKER_08]: compared to the average cost of
synthetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like I was saying, I'm big on
education.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here I am in Denver educating the home
growers, if you will, of our city.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here I am with Denver Normal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would like to apologize,
there are some of my slides that are a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit yellow or here, I don't know
kind of what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So some of these slides, if they're a
little bit different, I'd be happy to send
[SPEAKER_08]: you the slideshow, if need be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we are educating others.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a symposium as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So at least in Denver, the living soil
community is alive and thriving.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys ever come to Colorado,
please let me know because I'd love to
[SPEAKER_08]: introduce you to some of the brightest
minds I think, at least in our little
[SPEAKER_08]: area.
[SPEAKER_08]: All get to hang out and we all get to kind
of trade secrets and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also been a judge for cannabis cups,
which I am honored of.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here I am with, this is the founder of
Denver Normal and the founder of Normal
[SPEAKER_08]: itself, Keith Stroop and Jordan Person.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a special photo for me because the
reason we all get to smoke cannabis is
[SPEAKER_08]: because of this gentleman right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason I get to smoke cannabis
freely in Denver is because of this woman
[SPEAKER_08]: right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So pay a little homage to them.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's get to the meat of why
we're here.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I started out, this was actually the
shelf that I've actually started buying my
[SPEAKER_08]: products from.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've kind of gone full circle.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gone from the synthetics and now
we're using the soil food web to use soil
[SPEAKER_08]: microbes to grow the elite cannabis
instead of the synthetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, this is how I was able to come to
the full steps of what I guess you would
[SPEAKER_08]: call almost like a cultivation specialist.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for me, I started off learning more
about the rev with True Living Organics.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some, I don't know how many
people have read that book, but there are
[SPEAKER_08]: some nutrition spikes and stuff like that
that really isn't a living soil system.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I continued to educate myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I started making the Super Soil by
Subcool.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is more of like a mixture.
[SPEAKER_08]: You kind of have to let it sit in a corner
for about six weeks and let it cook,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_08]: That takes up a lot of space, a lot of
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be honest, some of the plants that
I was growing, you would see certain
[SPEAKER_08]: deficiencies because maybe I just didn't
mix it up correctly or just some human
[SPEAKER_08]: errors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I continued my education and then I
found out that I could grow with soil
[SPEAKER_08]: microbes, with red wigglers, with African
nightcrawlers, white springtail mites,
[SPEAKER_08]: and all of those are breaking down organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Into carbon, and then the carbon is
feeding the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as I continued to climb that ladder,
I began to then read Jeff Lohenfeld's
[SPEAKER_08]: books.
[SPEAKER_08]: He has Teaming with Microbes, Teaming with
Nutrients, and Teaming with Fungi,
[SPEAKER_08]: which I actually have right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you guys have not read those books,
I highly recommend it because those are
[SPEAKER_08]: game changers, especially if you're trying
to move from the synthetic world into the
[SPEAKER_08]: living soils.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then finally, this is kind of where
I'm at right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a gentleman in Colorado that's
teaching me more about what I would call
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado natural farming with the
indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's kind of where I feel if you're
going to the top level of living soil,
[SPEAKER_08]: that is probably where you're going to
have to be is to learn to make ferments,
[SPEAKER_08]: learn to make sprouted seed teas,
and all these things are cheap ingredients
[SPEAKER_08]: and easy to implement.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for a lot of people, especially me when
I first started, I had no idea that the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis plant is autotrophic,
meaning that it can feed itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that simply is just the microbes
breaking down organic matter, and then the
[SPEAKER_08]: exudates from the plants, which is really
just like sugars.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking about a little bit of
sugar, a little bit of protein,
[SPEAKER_08]: and a little bit of carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if there's any bakers in
here, but usually what is that recipe?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking cakes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking cookies.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what attracts the soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they work in a symbiotic
relationship to build that soil food web
[SPEAKER_08]: to where it is thriving.
[SPEAKER_08]: So cannabis plants actually prefer,
in a living soil system, prefer to grow
[SPEAKER_08]: out and wide than deep and down.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I grow, I focus on 20,
25 gallon pots minimum.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I don't know why that keeps
changing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if you guys can notice,
the roots itself really only go down about
[SPEAKER_08]: 36 inches.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they kind of like spread out more
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for some of those pots that you see
that are more depth, but not really wide,
[SPEAKER_08]: in my opinion, those are almost pointless
if you're trying to grow in a living soil
[SPEAKER_08]: system.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you use it for the synthetics,
then they're okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're using a soil system,
you need to use air pots, and you need to
[SPEAKER_08]: use lava rocks, and sphagnum peat moss,
and everything needs to be organic to make
[SPEAKER_08]: sure that you're continuing to build that
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so one of the easy examples for
using a cover crop is that this is bare
[SPEAKER_08]: soil, so we have an extreme amount of
runoff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when we're actually growing with
a cover crop, we're building up the
[SPEAKER_08]: rhizosphere, and that's allowing the water
to not have pretty much any runoff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a lot cleaner, obviously,
than the soil that doesn't contain any
[SPEAKER_08]: life whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people have been asking,
especially in California, are we able to
[SPEAKER_08]: implement this on a commercial level?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I gotta show you that even at a
small-time farm, this is my little
[SPEAKER_08]: homegrown right here on the left,
and then we do consulting all around the
[SPEAKER_08]: country, really, for living soil systems
on a commercial setting.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we usually do is walk in,
see how they implement.
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually if they are growing soils,
we'll just add the microbes, add compost
[SPEAKER_08]: teas, and get the microbe life to start
building up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then as soon as that happens,
we really try to focus on specific compost
[SPEAKER_08]: teas, fungal teas, bacteria teas,
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a grow that we did some consulting
for in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys were growing synthetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, Instagram?
[SPEAKER_07]: Back down in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just got a bunch of our veg move over
to flower here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you guys can see all this.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are just flowered, so they are
stretching a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're starting to stretch.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many of you in here are growing in a
commercial setting?
[SPEAKER_07]: How many of you use a living soil in that
commercial setting?
[SPEAKER_07]: End of the year, finishing out nicely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep you guys in touch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so again, these are normally flasks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why that's not showing up
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is really the key macronutrients,
obviously, is NPK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody knows that, nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in my opinion, it's calcium that we as
living soil farmers need to really focus
[SPEAKER_08]: on, because calcium only comes through the
transpiration stream, meaning we have to
[SPEAKER_08]: get the plant to take that up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the more calcium that we take up,
the better the plant's gonna do in the
[SPEAKER_08]: last few weeks as she begins to flower
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really focus on building that calcium
up, using amino acids to make sure that
[SPEAKER_08]: she's able to take up more calcium.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that will actually build up the
pectin within the cell wall itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: That will turn into, or pectic acid,
that will turn into pectin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the pectin is the glue that holds the
cell walls together.
[SPEAKER_08]: So really, the goal to grow high-end
cannabis using a living soil system is to
[SPEAKER_08]: also focus on the calcium, not just
magnesium, where I like to separate the
[SPEAKER_08]: two.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will use a little bit of calcium,
and I will use a little bit of magnesium,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I don't like the cow mag type,
where it's formulated already for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nitrogen is the growth element.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I'm growing in a vegetative state,
I focus on making sure that she's getting
[SPEAKER_08]: enough nitrogen, almost like a Goldilocks
principle, where I want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_08]: she's not eating nitrate nitrogen,
because she will take that up no matter
[SPEAKER_08]: what.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I'm a newer grower, and this says to
use five milliliters of the nitrate
[SPEAKER_08]: nitrogen formula, nitrate nitrogen,
a lot of new growers will use like 10
[SPEAKER_08]: milliliters.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you start to see later in flower,
she's still burning up that nitrate
[SPEAKER_08]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like me with peanut butter M
&Ms.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter what time of the night
it is, I will eat those no matter what's
[SPEAKER_08]: going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of the same thing with
nitrate nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: She will take that up no matter what.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll get huge, the internodal spacing
will be a lot different.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be almost like a foot sometimes,
six inches to a foot in spacing,
[SPEAKER_08]: where if I'm growing correctly,
I want to have maybe three or four inches
[SPEAKER_08]: of internodal spacing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The phosphorus is the energy element.
[SPEAKER_08]: I found a lot of the elite growers are
using that as kind of like a spark or a
[SPEAKER_08]: catalyst before they start using nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: They try to get the root structure to
start to build.
[SPEAKER_08]: Potassium is the health element.
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, this is where a lot of plants will
actually show a hidden hunger.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when you're starting to flower out
in the last few weeks, if you don't have
[SPEAKER_08]: enough potassium, they actually will just
stop growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of the newer growers,
home growers, don't really notice that
[SPEAKER_08]: until it's too late.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if there's not enough potassium,
it's almost like a hidden hunger.
[SPEAKER_08]: She just won't, what's the word I'm
looking for?
[SPEAKER_08]: She won't flower out and she won't show
her true tendencies and that kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_08]: without proper potassium.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then like I was saying, calcium is
that hidden element.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is the key, I think,
to growing elite cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're cultivating cannabis and we're
using, I would say, our brain and Mother
[SPEAKER_08]: Nature to improve the lifestyle of the
grower.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I'm growing, I don't have to worry
about pH levels.
[SPEAKER_08]: I use red wigglers, white spring tail
mites, African night crawlers to break
[SPEAKER_08]: down that organic matter, like I was
saying, and they will regulate the pH
[SPEAKER_08]: levels with the plant, communicating with
the plant through exudates.
[SPEAKER_08]: Growing with microbes, like I was saying,
it gives us the grower the confidence back
[SPEAKER_08]: to be able to grow the plant in a way
where we are more like coach and we kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of back up and we focus on letting her
become the Serena Williams, if you will.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm trying to get her ready for
Wimbledon and flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want her big and stocky, strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why some of the reasons I
focus on the microbes is you're just not
[SPEAKER_08]: gonna be able to achieve that with
synthetics in the long run.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I use the same soil over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my soil improves year after year.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm about four and a half years using the
same soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys would probably laugh at my
work week because we were talking maybe a
[SPEAKER_08]: couple hours a day compared to a lot of
the guys that are in synthetics,
[SPEAKER_08]: mixing nutrients, worried about pH levels,
the up and down of when you're a beginning
[SPEAKER_08]: farmer, you kind of put a little too much
and then you put a little pH up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't worry about any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I highly recommend that you guys
continue to educate yourself on why pH
[SPEAKER_08]: levels are just not as important in the
living soil system because we're not in
[SPEAKER_08]: charge anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that making sense?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the white spring termites for me
are kind of like the secret sauce,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_08]: They work in a symbiotic relationship with
the red wigglers and the African
[SPEAKER_08]: nightcrawlers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they kind of break down that organic
matter and turn it into food, into carbon.
[SPEAKER_08]: So with a living soil system, we have
found on the commercial level that we can
[SPEAKER_08]: literally grow for pennies on the dollar
compared to conventional methods.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like I said, reusing the same soil,
I'm able to get the full genetic profiles
[SPEAKER_08]: for some of you guys that are really like
phenohunters and go out there and try to
[SPEAKER_08]: find some of the best cannabis genetics
you can find, especially downstairs.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some famous people out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting the full genetic profiles.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm getting the blues and the purples
and the stuff that a lot of the other
[SPEAKER_08]: farmers just aren't able to achieve
because they are using synthetics instead
[SPEAKER_08]: of using microbes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the plant can actually say,
like, you know, communicating through the
[SPEAKER_08]: exudates with the microbes, oh,
I'd like a little bit of Chinese food
[SPEAKER_08]: today on Monday, or I'd like a little bit
of like a burger on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it allows the plant to decide what she
needs instead of me trying to force feed.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rhizosphere is really the secret to
every plant that's growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like if I just do this right here in
my hand right here, I have more soil
[SPEAKER_08]: microbes than there are people on this
planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're talking upon worlds upon worlds
upon worlds that we begin to grow with.
[SPEAKER_08]: So growing with mycorrhizal fungi,
is anybody here familiar with mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_08]: fungi?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would ask this question maybe a
year or two years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody had a clue.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to keep it simple, this is almost like
a dial-up internet of communication going
[SPEAKER_08]: on within your soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's almost no communication.
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes forever for the exudates to
communicate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once the mycorrhizal fungi is implemented
and begins to grow, this is almost like a
[SPEAKER_08]: fiber optic network.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're talking fast communication,
which really speeds up the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to go mycelium hunting.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is what's known as mycelium
carpet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not buy my mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will actually go out into nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: I take about 10% of what you would see.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I spread all of those spores
around to kind of improve on nature since
[SPEAKER_08]: I took away from nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a fantastic way to build up
your soil food web without having to spend
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of money and going out and getting
the mycorrhizal fungi, which in all
[SPEAKER_08]: honesty, they come from two places.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all the companies that are selling
mycorrhizal fungi, they're buying it from
[SPEAKER_08]: the same source.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if it's a little bit better of a
product, usually that just means they've
[SPEAKER_08]: been adding more.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a little bit of outdoor amendments
added as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you can see as things begin to
grow in my indoor, I can really get the
[SPEAKER_08]: mycelium carpet, the mycorrhizal fungi to
show up in the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for a living soil system grower,
that's almost like a threolite.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of where you pat yourself on
the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will proudly say that in a living soil
system, I've never grown three pounds of
[SPEAKER_08]: light.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not feasible, at least for me
yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will say that the quality is what
matters to me and making concentrates and
[SPEAKER_08]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Solventless diamonds is where I think the
market is moving towards.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like back in the day, I would go to a
breeder and they would make me look
[SPEAKER_08]: fantastic because I would buy their
genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would grow them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then everybody would be like,
well, you're such a great grower.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in reality, it's the breeder that's
making me look great.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think now the situation is moving to
where the extraction artists are looking
[SPEAKER_08]: for guys that grow without using any even
neem oil or any pesticides whatsoever so
[SPEAKER_08]: that they have that canvas so that they
can do their extraction and show off their
[SPEAKER_08]: artwork.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my old living soil, really broken
down, lots of red wigglers, lots of white
[SPEAKER_06]: spring-tailed mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this is the new soil here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just added Miller's vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I added a little crustacean meal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm trying to get the top
microbes to start thriving.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that really starts with just taking
from the old and putting in the new.
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of the reasons I add crustacean
meal is for chitin.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once I add chitin or insect frass,
the same thing, you're adding chitin to
[SPEAKER_08]: the top soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plant actually thinks it's being
attacked by bugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So she will build up an immune system
through chitinase.
[SPEAKER_08]: And using that chitin when it turns into
chitinase is basically like an immune shot
[SPEAKER_08]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a healthy way to build up its
immune system without using anything
[SPEAKER_08]: synthetic, all mother nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: The worms that I focus on are,
again, the red wigglers and the African
[SPEAKER_08]: nightcrawlers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the red wigglers were actually
simulated at basically the top,
[SPEAKER_08]: probably four or five inches, mostly where
the rhizosphere is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the African nightcrawlers will
kind of work the medium section of the
[SPEAKER_08]: soil itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I was trying to use the Canadian
nightcrawlers, because I know that they
[SPEAKER_08]: like to bury pretty deep.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that they would kind of build up that
dissolved oxygen for me with the channels
[SPEAKER_08]: and everything that they're moving around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, the reason why they're
called nightcrawlers is when night occurs,
[SPEAKER_08]: they actually go to the top to feed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Canadian nightcrawlers are so stupid
that they actually just fall out of the
[SPEAKER_08]: pot itself and die.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of a waste of money with
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I use lava rocks instead to kind of
build that up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can try Canadian nightcrawlers if you
like, but it's kind of a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_08]: So using the worms, I'm building up the
biofilm within the soil structure itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I know a lot of people don't have room
to build larger worm farms.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we actually teach our students in
Colorado a pretty cool trick.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we do is we'll take an avocado.
[SPEAKER_08]: We cut it with an X, kind of like a baked
potato.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I squeeze that, let it pop open.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I take the fleshy part and I
stick it into the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: The fats and the rind and everything
that's in the avocado, the red wigglers
[SPEAKER_08]: are attracted to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they will actually come up from the
soil itself to the top where I've just
[SPEAKER_08]: placed this avocado.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they will begin to kind of touch each
other and kind of move around.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they're hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as soon as they touch each other,
what happens is they begin to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our joke in Colorado is that when we
put these in our 25 gallon, 50 gallon,
[SPEAKER_08]: 100 gallon pots, these become like little
fraternities.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or fraternity houses, if you will.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of reproduction going
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the more I can put around into my soil,
five or six avocados, in about 30 days,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have a couple hundred worms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then another 90 days, they reproduce
their entire population.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's an easy way for you guys to buy a
little bit of worms, or have a buddy that
[SPEAKER_08]: will give you a little bit of worms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you can build and not have to pay
the, especially for commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, worms are one of the more
expensive things in a living soil system.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is just a way for you guys to be
able to add red wigglers to your system
[SPEAKER_08]: without having to spend any money.
[SPEAKER_08]: My goal when I'm teaching, especially with
the home grower, is always for you guys to
[SPEAKER_08]: grow for pennies, literal pennies,
compared to your conventional methods.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once they've eaten all of the
avocado, they will literally eat the pit
[SPEAKER_08]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: If the soil is alive and thriving,
it might only take like a week to two
[SPEAKER_08]: weeks for them to break everything down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once that's going on, you guys know
that you have a huge soil life or soil
[SPEAKER_08]: that's thriving.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's when, you know, really you're
only using water at that point to grow
[SPEAKER_08]: high-end cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're down here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just bought a bunch of buckets for
worms.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's all the baby worms that are
actually hatching along with the white
[SPEAKER_05]: springtail mites.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're starting to get everything down
in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way that we like to do it,
which is using living soils is also using
[SPEAKER_05]: red wigglers to drive everything and
increase the biodiversity that is almost
[SPEAKER_05]: like what we're known for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Biodiversity is key.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the more diverse compost that we have,
the more diverse microbes we have,
[SPEAKER_05]: the fuller genetic profiles we can achieve
growing high-end cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you could see in this video,
all the little white, the little tiny
[SPEAKER_08]: white, those are all the baby worms that
have just hatched from the avocado tree.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it really only takes maybe a week,
two weeks at most to start to really see
[SPEAKER_08]: the benefits of just adding the avocado.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, all the other stuff is the
white springtail mites.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they basically hitch a ride on the
worms and the worms build the dissolved
[SPEAKER_08]: oxygen channels for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the white springtail mites kind
of just take a ride on and break down
[SPEAKER_08]: everything as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: The key to the soil food web is the food
that it provides.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the bacteria and the fungi are actually
the food source.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're breaking down things.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's common that a lot of people think
that worms will actually eat the fruits,
[SPEAKER_08]: the banana peels, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually eat the bacteria that's
breaking down that material.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the more bacteria that you see in your
soil, the healthier you know that,
[SPEAKER_08]: at least in veg, that the plant is almost
ready for its Wimbledon, if you will.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the goal is to get the plant ready
for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the bacteria and the fungi,
as they're starting to grow, then the
[SPEAKER_08]: protozoa and the nematodes eat that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like fertilizer bags.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the nematodes and the protozoa
spread that around within the soil system
[SPEAKER_08]: itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you find in nature, usually the good
guys work in a symbiotic relationship and
[SPEAKER_08]: the bad guys have almost like an alpha.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the alpha microbes will usually
take over.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why when you're using like
compost teas and you're adding a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: sugar at the end, we have found that
that's actually kind of a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it speeds up those alphas,
where when I'm making a compost tea,
[SPEAKER_08]: my goal is almost like a shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to get as much diversity
through those microbes onto the soils and
[SPEAKER_08]: as well onto the leaf structure itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get a lot of people asking me on
Instagram that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They show me a lot of different bugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Springtails do not fly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I actually made a video for that
because a lot of these guys were showing
[SPEAKER_08]: me what I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: To be honest, I don't even know what bug
that was.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's flying around, that is not a
white springtail mite.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been getting some questions
online, what white springtail mites are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you see, they jump.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of you guys sending me videos of
little white bugs flying around in your
[SPEAKER_06]: soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually don't really know what that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can tell you that if you have the
white springtail mite, at least that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: using here in Colorado, these things do
not fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: They move fast throughout the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they can jump.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We basically monitor the white springtail
mite population.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of gauges to us how much
bacteria is really within the soil itself
[SPEAKER_06]: without having to constantly look at it
using a microscope.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you guys can see in all my beds,
whether it's in vetch, I'm using a cover
[SPEAKER_08]: crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's in flower, I'm still covering that
soil with like a Timothy hay, barley hay
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of a setup.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason is there's no bare soil in
nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're trying to replicate the redwood
forest, if you will, in the living soil
[SPEAKER_08]: systems inside our inside grows.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's why we never let anything be
bare to make sure that we never have to
[SPEAKER_08]: really add a bunch of inputs once
everything's alive and thriving.
[SPEAKER_08]: The less you have to deal with it,
the better off you'll be.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's almost like I have a lot of guys
that are like, OK, now what do I do?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, go outside.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go hang out with your family.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to pH anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to worry about all the
things and a lot of the side work,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you will, of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: All that stuff's gone away now that we're
using mother nature to churn the soil for
[SPEAKER_08]: us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that it takes about a year to
really get the yields that you're probably
[SPEAKER_08]: accustomed to using synthetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just, I guess, one of the cons of
growing in a living soil system.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I assure you, the quality of the
cannabis that you're growing, you will not
[SPEAKER_08]: really worry about yield anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like I was saying before, I think the
extraction orders and the stuff that's
[SPEAKER_08]: coming out and will be coming out in 2019,
that's the high end stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: The solventless diamonds, in my opinion,
that's what the market is moving towards,
[SPEAKER_08]: is the extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I grow with a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: And part of that is, obviously,
no bare soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm also adding, with crimson clover,
I'm adding nitrogen from the air.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's pulling the nitrogen into the
soil itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's building a barrier where the good
microbes can thrive.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a lot harder for the bad microbes
to thrive because there's almost no food
[SPEAKER_08]: source.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I have a root here and I have my
bacteria, my fungi constantly eating,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's no room for the bad bacteria and
the bad microbes to be able to have a food
[SPEAKER_08]: source.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of the times, as long as you have
a symbiotic relationship, you don't even
[SPEAKER_08]: really have to worry about bad nematodes,
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cover crop here in this photo let me
know that I had a thrift problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it started over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it began on the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when I walked into my room,
I saw ladybugs and a bunch of baby praying
[SPEAKER_08]: mantises on the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for me, that's a red flag.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there's something on that
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I need to pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe I need to remove it from the
room.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I do consulting, unfortunately,
a lot of people don't tell me the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when I go into a grow, one of the
first things I do is I bring my trusty
[SPEAKER_08]: bunny.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I put that on their cover crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will see if she will eat the cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: If she eats the cover crop, I know that
the farmer is telling me the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: If she doesn't eat the cover crop,
I know that they're spraying some kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticide or some kind of fungicide.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the bunny itself will not eat that
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how do we prove that when we grow in a
living soil that we're not using
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticides?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for me, I like to use a bunny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bunnies are pretty intelligent for their
size.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they know when to eat leafy green and
when not to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're growing in a living soil and
you want to make sure that everything
[SPEAKER_06]: seems as healthy as possible and you
respect Mother Nature as much as possible,
[SPEAKER_06]: buy a little bunny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a little bunny run around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if he chooses to eat the cover crop,
then you know you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the bunny, as well as alpacas,
are what's known as a cold manure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Meaning as soon as they relieve
themselves, you can actually take that and
[SPEAKER_08]: put it onto the soil system itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as she's eating, she's pooping.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cold manure, so that's okay with
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really going to affect pH or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: The worms love rabbit poop, so it's kind
of a continuous system.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once I start building the bacterial,
once I'm now focused on turning that plant
[SPEAKER_08]: into a flower, I will add fungal aspects
into my soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll begin to add like brand flakes.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: The avocados, the purple corn.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then those begin to be broken down by
the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they actually will start to grow that
mycelium carpet that we're after.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once it starts to grow into the
sunlight, that's when you know that really
[SPEAKER_08]: things are thriving and you're on the
right track.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once I start to see it show up in the
sunlight itself, I add kefir.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a non-lactate dairy product,
so it's easier for the plant to take up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you guys have ever eaten
or drank kefir.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once I started to see what it did to my
plants, I now drink that every single
[SPEAKER_08]: morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I highly recommend you guys find out
about probiotics, prebiotics, that kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff, because the focus of a living soil
is that we're building a stomach,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a living, breathing thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we focus on the inputs that we put
in there, the output is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: What goes in and what comes out,
it has to be quality ingredients,
[SPEAKER_08]: has to be organic, and there's nothing
wrong with spending a little extra money
[SPEAKER_08]: on some of those things now that we don't
have to buy the synthetics and buy all the
[SPEAKER_08]: amendments that, at least they made me
believe for a long time that I had to
[SPEAKER_08]: have.
[SPEAKER_08]: One guy even was like, synthetics are
almost like a secret thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Secret sauce, if you will.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were joking that, you know,
what is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's really just salts and water.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you're going in there and you're
buying something that comes in a bottle
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's with water, more than likely,
95% of that is, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_08]: wasted money.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then my ceiling starts to grow,
I add the oats, and then it really starts
[SPEAKER_08]: to take off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once I start to see this, I'll usually
put them in the dark for maybe 48 hours
[SPEAKER_08]: before I put them into flour.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the rest is really pretty basic,
just adding water, maybe adding a little
[SPEAKER_08]: bit of amendments to certain plants for
the top feed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then these are friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the people I really admire is Jeff
Lohenfeld, like I was speaking on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other one is Dr. Judith
Fitzpatrick.
[SPEAKER_08]: She makes the microbiometer.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is one of the ways that you can
start to test what you're doing at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the levels of the microbes that
you have within your soil system itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Judith did a test on my living soil when
she was out in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I still, I believe so, I still have
the highest test that's ever been done by
[SPEAKER_08]: Judith.
[SPEAKER_08]: The average scores are between 600 and
800.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine was 1755.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you guys can see that like,
you know, growing living soils and paying
[SPEAKER_08]: attention to the inputs that you're
putting in, I'm excited to now see that
[SPEAKER_08]: there's other companies that are making
products where we can see for ourselves
[SPEAKER_08]: the amount of work that we're putting in
and the outputs that are coming out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all that has come from the few books
that I've read.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I was saying, because Shango Lewis's
podcast, I'm self-taught.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I encourage you guys that, you know,
this can be done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the cannabis that I've grown.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I will leave it for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: You talked about picking up fungus in the
wild and bringing it to your garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you insert that in the soil?
[SPEAKER_08]: I will just take that and kind of mix it
into the top.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll go out into Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: You find, like I was showing in the photo,
you find that mycelium carpet,
[SPEAKER_08]: you take, you know, the average is you
take no more than 10%.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where you're not really stealing
from Mother Nature and you're just
[SPEAKER_08]: improving your own grow back home.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will take that and then I will just
drizzle it on the top.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's a newer pot and I can plant a
clone or something like that, I'll drizzle
[SPEAKER_08]: it in that area as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: On your soils, when you were using soil,
do you, how long do you go between
[SPEAKER_03]: changing out the old, 35, 50 gallon pot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you just keep adding to it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just keep adding to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep adding to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long does that go for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Years?
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as I know, I would love to pass it
on to my son.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's three years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my goal is to, if there is a problem,
I just continue to feed with compost,
[SPEAKER_08]: compost teas.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really where you're going to get
all of the magic that is in the
[SPEAKER_08]: rhizosphere is by focusing on high quality
inputs, focusing on biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to use a compost from cow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to use a compost from buffalo.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to use a compost from fish.
[SPEAKER_08]: That way I get that full biodiversity and
then I get the full genetic profile.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're great.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have another question.
[SPEAKER_09]: You say you use calcium separate from Cal
Mag.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you do that?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I like to foiler feed with Epsom salt
for the magnesium and I like to add like
[SPEAKER_08]: oyster shell flour and those kind of
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even what we can get into after this,
I could speak to you on like Colorado
[SPEAKER_08]: Natural Farming where we're making
ferments where we're using bone and that
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of thing and breaking that down with
rice vinegar and that kind of stuff and
[SPEAKER_08]: adding that as a calcium source.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot other ways to add calcium
than just your typical Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned earlier with the molasses or
something going into the compost teas,
[SPEAKER_01]: you were saying not at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean you just add it at the
beginning or you're adding less?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned like the shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that part of that or is that something
else entirely?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it is part of the shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I found is through Dr. Elaine
Ingham's research is that when you add it
[SPEAKER_08]: at the end, the alphas emerge because you
just added another huge food source.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I like to try to just keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just use a compost tea and then I
will maybe add a little bit of sugar water
[SPEAKER_08]: after I fed that, but I don't put it into
the tea itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I encourage you guys to experiment
with the teas that you're making because
[SPEAKER_08]: if you're brewing a tea outside of your
room, you're brewing totally different
[SPEAKER_08]: microbes at like 70 degrees than if you're
brewing them at 75, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have to, in your environment,
you have to do the research and the due
[SPEAKER_08]: diligence on your own to find out which
temperature you should be brewing these
[SPEAKER_08]: teas at and then implement them.
[SPEAKER_08]: The easiest way I've seen is to brew the
tea within the grow room itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_04]: A great presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did want to speak on a common
misconception about the yields in living
[SPEAKER_04]: soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing them for quite a while,
two or three years on a personal level,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we've just scaled up on the commercial
scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we're finding is that a lot of
folks are under this common misconception
[SPEAKER_04]: that a living soil or a water only or a
minimum input style cultivation equates to
[SPEAKER_04]: immediately a reduced yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're just finding that that's
simply not the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're pulling two and a half pounds of
light on first cycle crops that aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: even really truly living yet off of those
700 watt LED fixture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the yield potential is still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think moving forward in educating
people in living soils, we really need to
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of illustrate that there are people
out there that are hitting these numbers
[SPEAKER_04]: that synthetic guys are getting with
literally just freshwater.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I can just kind of, to be honest,
I can look at you until you're probably a
[SPEAKER_08]: fantastic grower.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just have that look.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's probably more the exception to the
norm.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are a newer grower, it does take a
little while to understand soil food web.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have been growing for a long time,
obviously that learning curve is going to
[SPEAKER_08]: be a lot shorter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love your presentation of the bunny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question about water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you pick a certain type of water?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do to your water for the
living soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you apply it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And are you concerned about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the personal grow and my own home
grow, I use what's known as a small boy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I make sure that I'm focused on
removing the chlorine, but also what's
[SPEAKER_08]: known as chloramine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So chloramine is what's really going to
kill your soil food web.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I focus on adding oxygen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a big blue barrel that I constantly
am adding oxygen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to make sure that I'm brewing away and
basically blasting off that chlorine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm using that small boy filter
with the charcoal filter to make sure that
[SPEAKER_08]: none of that chlorine is going into my
water source.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, like I was saying,
the red wigglers and the widespread
[SPEAKER_08]: termites and everything that's working in
harmony with each other, they will then
[SPEAKER_08]: regulate those pH levels.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't worry about my water pH ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't worry about pH ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know a lot of that might sound
foreign to you guys, but in the synthetic
[SPEAKER_08]: world, yes, pH matters because you are
force feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the times when you're feeding the
plant itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your thoughts on reverse osmosis
water in living soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know recently within the past six months
or a year, I've been coming across some
[SPEAKER_04]: literature talking about how actually the
action of pushing the water through the
[SPEAKER_04]: membrane changes the structure of the
water in such a way where it interacts
[SPEAKER_04]: negatively with the nutrients and with
that kind of exchange that happens in the
[SPEAKER_04]: rise of spirit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you come across any of that
information in regards to not being a
[SPEAKER_08]: detriment?
[SPEAKER_08]: I do know what you're speaking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd love to talk to you about that
more.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think that reverse osmosis water is
lifeless.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm trying to grow a life.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want things to be alive and thriving.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so especially in a commercial setting,
in my opinion, it's a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're robbing some of the
essential minerals out of the water,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of that calcium that could be made
available by the improved soil treatment.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
Thank you.
Thank you.
