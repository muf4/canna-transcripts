[SPEAKER_01]: So with more and more people coming to
cannabis to try it for the first time and
[SPEAKER_01]: now so many of us are able to expand our
pallets because we've got more than the
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing that our plug had for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you recommend Kevin as to how the
newcomers can maybe like build a flight or
[SPEAKER_01]: try a wide range of cannabis so that they
can find out what they like in a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient way because you know it's
expensive to experiment with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: similarly those of us who have been in
cannabis for years and years, we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting access to new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would you recommend somebody who's
new to it or wants to expand their pallet
[SPEAKER_01]: to do so in a way where they can reach and
be efficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question because there's so
many choices that it becomes almost
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming for the average individual to
really determine where to begin,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they like, why even like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did is I tried to neck down
42,000 terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 42,000 different terpenes we
basically had to create the smell
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so no one alive could remember all of
this and no one would be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said from all the years of
distributing cannabis that really it
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks down into four fundamental groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth, fuel, floral, and fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those basically are very simple terms
but it allows you to see the different
[SPEAKER_00]: terp profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was challenged on this by some
researchers about where did you come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said it's just intuition for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they challenged it scientifically and
really it was accurate but it basically
[SPEAKER_00]: broke down into you have a fruit and a
fuel and underneath fuel is earth and
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath fruit is floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can basically break down 42,000
terpenes into two major groups in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, fruit and fuel and then below
fuel is earth and below fruit is floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really accurate scientifically
which was interesting because for me it
[SPEAKER_00]: was intuition but for the scientists they
wanted to see if this hypothesis was
[SPEAKER_00]: correct and it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the importance of it is that it allows
you to be able to break it up into four
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they each have some very specific type
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruits are basically uplifting,
florals are more introspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: earth is more sedative, gas is very
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those type of sensations you
experience really are pretty dominant even
[SPEAKER_00]: if the cannabinoid levels fluctuate and
some of the ratios fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the terp doesn't determine the entire
effect in high but it definitely is a
[SPEAKER_00]: predicator of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does, it allows individuals to
say okay I want to try things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: introspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would go then through floral
categories, things that had floral smells,
[SPEAKER_00]: exotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would look through those for
the things that worked for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you wanted uplifting then we would
go into citrus tones, lemons, limes,
[SPEAKER_00]: grapefruits, things that really spark up
your eyes and open you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we wanted to have a radical change
in effect of what we're doing we would go
[SPEAKER_00]: into gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically what's trendy now
with all the OGs, the sours, where you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a very heavy myrcine pining base that
just, and there's other subtleties that
[SPEAKER_00]: make this gaseous effect but it's very
powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people who want that, that's
individuals who need pain relief
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a radical change of tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then earth is stuff that was old
school bubble cush, the Hindu cush,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the potencies were around really 11
to 13, they really weren't high potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you felt it really well because it
allowed you to have a very beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: relaxing body high but without too much
mental raciness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're able as a consumer,
if you can take a look at this,
[SPEAKER_00]: it says hey what am I seeking?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to have what kind of effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most people they would like to
have a couple different choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we say is then you get into
the four different categories,
[SPEAKER_00]: a fuel and earth, a floral and a fruit,
and then you go and consume them
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the day in the right sequence,
where you would consume the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: had the most heavy impact when you had the
least amount of mental effort and you
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were using stuff that was very
open and light while you were using your
[SPEAKER_00]: creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically fruits in the morning,
floral after that so that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: introspective as you move through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get into earth in the later
afternoon because it's relaxing but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not devastating and then you can get into
heavy fuels in the evening where they just
[SPEAKER_00]: basically sit you down and really let you
change your tone completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those four categories you'll be
able to start, I tell people you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: notebook and you just take a look and if
you can take a look at some of the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that you really like and you can look at
the chemotype profiles which is really the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall cannabinoids and the ratios,
you'll start to find certain ones that let
[SPEAKER_00]: you know hey I like a lot of THC because I
want that euphoria but I want enough CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it to where it's not edgy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll start to see these ratios and
you'll start to see these relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll start to let you take a look at
because this is all documented now when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're selling cannabis all this
information is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could go into a modern store and if
they data-based it correctly you'd be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to say what I'm looking for is something
in this type of basic profile with ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: like this and you'd be able to get into a
little subset of things that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: within that and then you would try those
because no lab report is you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're your own lab report and every
single number could line up across the
[SPEAKER_00]: board and still not the one you like but
it lets you exit off the list and it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to to make it a little simpler
though because otherwise you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 samples not four and you want to be
able to make this easier and more
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable and so for me the way I
recommend it is to break it up in this
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion and just journal it and try to use
a repeatable process meaning the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it so you have to basically set
the same smoking situation to evaluate so
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to evaluate your morning smoke
you need to basically smoke it at your
[SPEAKER_00]: house while you're drinking coffee in the
morning like that every day the same
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise you're comparing apples to
oranges not the other way around and that
[SPEAKER_00]: changes how you affect the high so if I'm
in a bad mood and I consume it and I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: a good mood and I consume it then it's
really you're putting a huge influence on
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect itself and so when you're
trying to find out what works for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: really what are the varieties that really
satisfy once you can really put it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: clear context now what you have is the
ability to say that's what I like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need to look anymore yes I can try new
things when it's convenient but I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy an ounce of that and I want to buy an
ounce of that and that'll last me the next
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks and hopefully when you're
talking to the people you're buying it
[SPEAKER_00]: from you're asking them are these farms
solvent do you think they're gonna be in
[SPEAKER_00]: business in three weeks and that way what
it does is it lets you get a repeatability
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise you have to keep repeating this
process but it it you can make it very
[SPEAKER_00]: simple and you don't have to know the
complexities you don't have to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: memorize the cannabinoids it's not
important that you know every terpene by
[SPEAKER_00]: heart and what they do that's wonderful
but that's for fishing autos on a very
[SPEAKER_00]: introspective scientific type vision users
just need to say I like it or I don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: it it's that simple and did it work or did
it not work was it affordable was it not
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable and then you can get into the
emotional components of did the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: produce it in a manner that I can agree
with meaning you know are they really
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally conscious do they have a
real concern for the product and all those
[SPEAKER_00]: factors weave in but first make it simple
on what kind of effect you're seeking then
[SPEAKER_00]: then log to find out what cannabinoid
levels seem to be comfortable for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: what ratios and pretty soon you have a
good guidebook on what to do right on
[SPEAKER_00]: great thank you very much welcome right on
you you
