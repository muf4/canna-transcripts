[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe I went the whole summer
and that didn't even occur to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: just to get a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, sort of one of those things,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I fool around with these plasma
lights down in Oregon, there's a guy down
[SPEAKER_01]: there who's testing them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're the next thing I'm reading
for a homegrown, I want one that's that
[SPEAKER_01]: big that you can use in a tent,
because they have unbelievable efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the root systems are twice the size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this guy kept insisting that he was
going to dig it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, he was pulling off the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept saying, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you're filming this or
not, but that's sort of the tendency.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people pick off the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they pick off the leaves extensively,
I think, to make the bottom nodes maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: get a little bit more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite sure what they do,
but I think that's what it must be,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I just tuck them under.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kept saying, geez, you don't
understand how big your root ball is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we dug it up, and I went,
holy crap, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and you pull those leaves off,
and the root system's going, you screw the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be in balance and work
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to be very careful how you
pinch back and train plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where we live here in the Northwest,
one of our biggest issues is mold,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of folks here will pinch
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, for the light to get in,
but also so the air can get in so that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's constant fresh air in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that worth the trade-off to pinch
leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think if there's a way you can
train the plant by pulling it apart a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit, the least disturbance you can
do to the physical part of the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the leaves really banking nutrients
for future use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, those nutrients get used up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why you see those bottom leaves
turn yellow is because those nutrients are
[SPEAKER_01]: being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can pull those yellow ones off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people just get a little carried
away with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tempting to play with our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will make a good addendum to our
series.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the next question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've bred these cannabis plants,
again, using the hydroponic model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pumping food into them, pumping food into
them, pumping food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we really need to do that to all
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we're in the soil model,
have we taken the hydroponic model into
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil world, or have we sort of altered
it a little bit so that now we're using
[SPEAKER_01]: the giant pumpkin model?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put as much food in the soil as
you possibly can, that may not grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the best cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, I think that's what we've
got to get back to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to start thinking about what
kind of cannabis we're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big is not necessarily the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big is not necessarily better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for good quality,
and the specific kind of quality that we
[SPEAKER_01]: as an individual might want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might want medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might want recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I forgot how we got on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's take just one more step.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if on one end it is powerfully
interactive, it's interesting to grow an
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflower in a plain, bagged potting soil
and not give it a bunch of food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just interesting to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year was my first year growing autos,
and I did a bunch of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the damn thing is they all grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You used the same seeds the whole time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did it with three different types of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were all autoflowers,
all feminized, and they all grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that you can pop seeds April
1st and harvest July 1, pop a second round
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeds July 1, and be done October 1,
that's two cycles with no light depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here in the Northwest, that's like
gold, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, because Alaska, that is platinum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question, though, is that let's say,
so now this season, and for folks who are
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of years into autoflowers,
we're looking to fine tune.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's say, OK, we're already impressed
that we don't have to use nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that we don't want to give too
many nutrients, because that will confuse
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you suggest would be a couple
of amendments that we might want to use to
[SPEAKER_02]: find that happy medium where, OK,
yeah, we don't have to add a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what might be the targeted few that
will supercharge our plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I'd approach this the second
year is to experiment in two ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to experiment fertilizing during
the vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would use the typical vegetative
fertilizers we talk about, which those are
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that are high nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would also experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would then let them go into flower and
not fertilize them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would take some that I would
fertilize only in the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third set, of course,
I'd fertilize both.
[SPEAKER_01]: To see, I think that makes a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like the idea of letting the
plant grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it flowers in the two to three weeks
that it normally should flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you've got to plant this getting
into the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then fooling around with the Ferts
during the flowering stage may produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: best result.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go a little bit deeper on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly, we all have got more
experimentation to do with these
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got to share it, which is why
that autoflower network is so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, autoflower.net.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where do you think it's going to
end up, though, in your experience with
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil food web and your experience with
checking out autoflowers outside of this
[SPEAKER_02]: testing for people who, like, you know,
I'm very patient focused, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a patient who's using autoflowers
because they've got low mobility,
[SPEAKER_02]: low resources and low space, let's just
cut them to the ending and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what we think the research is
going to show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just use these few additives.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you tell them to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soybean and molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mycorrhizal fungi, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I like soybean and molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can find GMO soybean, that's pretty
tough to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unsulfur molasses, of course,
not too much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bacterial food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soybeans are fungal food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mix of the two together,
the microbes love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you say soybeans, do you mean like
okara?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I always tell people, you know,
originally fertilizer was manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think people figured out,
gee, I don't have to use just the manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard to carry around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't I use the stuff that makes the
manure?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they bought the food that goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go to a feed store, you can find
unsulfur molasses because it's a food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can find soybean meal,
also food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes great micro food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great for the lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never used soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to look into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's only used when it's eaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it on my lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Thank you.
