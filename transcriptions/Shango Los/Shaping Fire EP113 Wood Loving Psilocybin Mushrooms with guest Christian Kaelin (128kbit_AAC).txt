[SPEAKER_00]: We humans have been enjoying psychedelic
mushrooms for so long that it may have
[SPEAKER_00]: even been before we are Homo sapiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though most of us get our
mushrooms from our weed dealer,
[SPEAKER_00]: they really are nature and occur outside
and grow nearby in the forest for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be really clear in your
identification so you don't end up dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be taking mushrooms to talk to God,
but that doesn't mean we want to see God
[SPEAKER_00]: in person after accidentally eating a
truly poisonous mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's episode is about a special group
of psilocybin mushrooms who love growing
[SPEAKER_00]: on hardwood and how you can wildcraft them
and also grow a patch in your yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your neighbor's yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your local park.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn about cannabis
health, cultivation, and technique
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently and with good cheer,
I encourage you to subscribe to our
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 113.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Christian Kaelin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christian is primarily self-taught,
but he has been very successful teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early 2000s, Christian worked for
Paul Stamets at Fungi Perfecti,
[SPEAKER_00]: managing the farm team performing mass
sterilization and inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there, he created the first SOPs for
medicinal mushroom powder and tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that time, he has worked on a series
of consulting and manufacturing projects
[SPEAKER_00]: covered by NDAs for himself and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is presently adjunct faculty at Bastyr
University, where he develops and teaches
[SPEAKER_00]: mycology courses for graduate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christian also is founder and owner of
Provisions Mushroom Farm in Olympia,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provisions is the first CSA-supported
agricultural mushroom farm in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sells over a thousand pounds of
culinary mushrooms per week through local
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers markets, grocery stores,
and restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also produces tinctures and various
mycelium and mushroom products for
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesale and retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, Christian maintains a coveted
in-house master tissue cultural library
[SPEAKER_00]: for food and medicinal production.
[SPEAKER_00]: His company is so respected that his
internship opportunities are accredited by
[SPEAKER_00]: the Evergreen State College.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set today, we will learn
about the wood-loving mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: who they are, and how they function.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second set, we will discuss
wild-crafting wood lovers, their ecology,
[SPEAKER_00]: and responsible harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the third set, we go
step-by-step through creating and
[SPEAKER_00]: sustaining a wood-loving psilocybin
mushroom plot at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Christian.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for folks whose familiarity
with mushrooms stops at, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: are they hallucinogenic or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's create a little bit of context to
bring everybody on the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people talk about these
mushrooms as psilocybin mushrooms kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: generally, but the genus is psilocybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's start with that context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you give us a quick summary of the
psilocybe genus of fungi and maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of their characteristics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to kind of categorize the different
species in the psilocybe genus in three
[SPEAKER_01]: different categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, wood lovers that we want to
talk about today, coprotropic or
[SPEAKER_01]: coprophilic mushrooms that like manure,
feces, and also grass lovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all basically saprotrophs that
like dead or decaying materials,
[SPEAKER_01]: substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some will also integrate in manure and
grass, and some just in wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think those are distinguishing
factors that kind of delineate all the
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybe mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the fact that they have psilocybin a
key attribute of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that since psilocybe is in
the name of the genus, that would be true,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know that to be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they vary in potency, but generally,
all psilocybe mushrooms have psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you've given us like these three
general baskets in psilocybe, the wood
[SPEAKER_00]: lovers, the manure lovers, and the grass
lovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to focus on the wood lovers
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think our next step would be to
identify that next smaller basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those three are all part of the
psilocybe genus, what would you say are
[SPEAKER_00]: the attributes specifically of the wood
lovers?
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have very similar phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different varying potencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more research that we do on analyzing
the constituents, the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_01]: properties in these species, we'll find
that they each have differing compounds at
[SPEAKER_01]: differing potencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, the wood lovers all have
very similar characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their stem morphology and their caps all
have kind of a similar resemblance to
[SPEAKER_01]: spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they all are distinguished.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're in that distinguishable
category, basically, because they're so
[SPEAKER_01]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like not only are there
morphological similarities between them,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning they look the same, but the more
science we're able to do on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're probably also going to find a lot of
similarities in the chemistry of them as
[SPEAKER_00]: that research gets done, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their caps may vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are more rounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are pointed on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are a little more brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are more caramel caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are even white.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some very macroscopic big
differences within the wood lovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're discovering a lot still today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so out of around 250, 300 different
species in this philosophy genus,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're dealing with close to a
dozen or so in the wood lovers that we
[SPEAKER_01]: know of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's still a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly where I'm going next,
is how many of the wood lovers exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I don't think that's a scientific
definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's more like a convenience
definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I was doing my homework for the
program, some people were suggesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, there are only really three main wood
lovers, and then there's a couple rare
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody else is like,
oh, there's really five major wood lovers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there's the rest of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my research, I came up with 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know whether or not there
are 11 or 100, and I only found 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're suggesting that there's really
12 that really fit the definition,
eh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, taxonomy isn't my strong suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just put that out there right off
the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I specialize in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I leave a lot of these bigger taxonomy
questions to the taxonomists out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, on average, we're finding more
and more every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that number is changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as well as the taxonomy work that's
being done, we're finding that those
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific names are changing,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we thought was philosophy bohemica
is now being correlated to serbica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the names change as well as the
discoveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really is a confusing thing in
science, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a long history of keeping
freshwater fish aquariums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was always weird when I'd go to the
Seattle Aquarium Club meetings,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'd announce that some fish had
changed from one name to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all like, what the hell,
man?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can imagine that that happens in
every branch of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have got bohemica in my notes
and also serbica in my notes and didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that they were the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a feeling that's probably going to
happen for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just ever-increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: More people out there hunting,
looking for new species.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more collaboration online on all
the different websites that are
[SPEAKER_01]: documenting the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not going to necessarily go into
every one of the 12 wood lovers
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically, but just for name
recognition, would you just tell us the
[SPEAKER_00]: names of some of the real cornerstone wood
lovers that people tend to have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: and like?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting from the top, some of the most
potent mushrooms are the wood lovers,
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybe, azurescens in the Pacific
Northwest, known as one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in the southern hemisphere in New
Zealand, Australia, you have psilocybe
[SPEAKER_01]: suboriginosa, which is also, they say,
probably equally as potent as the
[SPEAKER_01]: azurescens just on a different part of the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all comes down to like we talked
about before, the analysis of the
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds are going to come out more and
more of what variety is going to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: potent over time as we include all the
different precursors to psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like we talked about bohemica is
kind of next, the cervica, the cyanescence
[SPEAKER_01]: also here in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about wood lovers is now that we
have more interest around the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: both in cultivation and in identification
that these mushrooms are being distributed
[SPEAKER_01]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so their habitats are changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What used to be found just in the Pacific
Northwest is now found in Central Park in
[SPEAKER_01]: downtown New York City, because people
have taken samples of the culture or the
[SPEAKER_01]: spores and transfer them as they travel,
or maybe mistakenly or directly,
[SPEAKER_01]: consciously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're starting to see all these
different varieties be distributed all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think like the like,
I would say to name a few others,
[SPEAKER_01]: the spring psilocybe known as ovoid or the
ovoidiocystidiana found in Ohio,
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennsylvania area was recently discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was discovered a while back,
but the taxonomy work was just recently
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ellenii also was something that
was discovered by John Allen back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of got back into circulation
around 2004, 2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now Allen Rockefeller and his crew
have done the taxonomy work on that and
[SPEAKER_01]: renamed it to psilocybe ellenii to kind of
celebrate John Allen's work over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with many species, one of the
things that controls their geographic
[SPEAKER_00]: location is the fact that they work in any
particular bio region.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the wood lovers, the thing that they
have in common is the habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would think that anywhere that
you're going to find one of these species,
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in another wood lover species is
likely to catch on there as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because what the habitat they need is so
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a realistic assumption I'm making?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen multiple species in one
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, they love the same habitat for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some might like grassier areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the azure essence is typically
found on the coast, near wood and sedge
[SPEAKER_01]: grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's different kind of symbiotic or
not symbiotic, but just synergistic kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of symbiosis of growing mediums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as long as you have wood,
though, generally these varieties are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: To anthropomorphize it, they may all be
scientifically wood lovers, but they do
[SPEAKER_00]: have their own personalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both in what you get internally,
as well as macroscopically or
[SPEAKER_01]: microscopically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for most people, the reason why these
wood lovers matter and come up on their,
[SPEAKER_00]: on their radar is because they have
psilocybin in them and they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're hallucinogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whether or not somebody is looking
to have a, you know, a hallucinogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: experience or whether or not they're
looking to microdose, it's that attribute
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are most interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, you know, I have come across,
you know, all the other psilocybe genus
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms way more than I have come
across.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wood lovers in my own life,
which is, you know, variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, where I live on Vashon
Island, if you were one of the kids who
[SPEAKER_00]: grew up here on Vashon, the mushroom that
you've been most in contact with is
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanescence because they grow abundantly
here on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I didn't live somewhere where I
knew, you know, that there were naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mushrooms that I came across were
all cultivated indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where I'm going with this is that
I'm curious to know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you compare them, do the wood lovers
produce psilocybin in comparison to the
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of psilocybin that we find in
other psilocybe cultivated varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, Golden Teacher and Penis
Envy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, can they compete with these very
popular mushrooms on potency?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, they're more than likely more
potent, depending on the species of the
[SPEAKER_01]: wood lovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: As your essence sub-originosa is up to 1%
more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: When, you know, you're looking at super
active species is going to have about 1%
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin content in dried form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have almost a 1% degree increase
in psilocybin content from that initial
[SPEAKER_01]: potency of 1%, that's a significant
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that changes the experience
internally is all the precursors to
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's actually happening is psilocin
is being dephosphorylated in our body and
[SPEAKER_01]: created into psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cubensis a lot of times have equal
parts psilocybin and equal parts psilocin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why you're getting kind of an
extreme experience in cubensis a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times, which is different than some of the
more potent wood lovers, because you have
[SPEAKER_01]: more psilocybin than psilocin in some of
these wood lovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we learn more and have more research
in dialing in what's happening with these
[SPEAKER_01]: precursors, in our experience,
beocysteine, neurobeocysteine are
[SPEAKER_01]: basically identical twins to serotonin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all acting on the same
serotonin receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll find that, you know, the potencies
are different as we, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: take them person to person, but also
mushroom to mushroom and species to
[SPEAKER_01]: species, depending on those different
precursors and constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I understand you correctly,
what I think you're, what you're saying is
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, even though some of the
wood lovers are more potent in psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_00]: cubensis have the experience of being more
potent for some people because the wood
[SPEAKER_00]: lovers are very psilocybin rich and
psilocybin is a, what do they call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: a pro drug, which means that it's,
it's a drug that we take in our body and
[SPEAKER_00]: then our body turns it into something that
is actually the hallucinogen in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so psilocybin is in the mushroom and
it's the pro drug and then, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: eat it and our body turns it into
psilocin, which is really what gives the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, cubensis, instead of it being,
you know, 80, 20 psilocybin to psilocin,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, it's more like 50,
50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when you take a cubensis,
you are having the experience more
[SPEAKER_00]: intensely and faster because it's already
got psilocin on board, ready to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: an experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I said that backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially I said psilocin turns into
psilocybin, but I meant like you were
[SPEAKER_01]: saying psilocybin being dephosphorylated
into psilocin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it's very helpful for me to
hear the word psilocin stated by an actual
[SPEAKER_00]: mycologist too, because so many of us,
we, we learn from books, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I've discussed this
before on the show, whether or not it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a psilocin or psilocin or whatever,
but I wasn't talking with mycologists and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not the right people to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when it comes to the Latin
versions, I know, no one's really an
[SPEAKER_01]: expert on pronunciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of just goes with whatever feels
comfortable these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So psilocin or psilocin or, you know,
however we say our tomato or tomato kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we call wood lovers, wood lovers,
are mushrooms that are not wood lovers,
[SPEAKER_00]: would we just call those like regular or
would we call them manure lovers or grass
[SPEAKER_00]: lovers?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a simple way of how to talk
about this casually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like wood lovers and like regular
mushrooms or is wood lovers so not
[SPEAKER_00]: actually scientific that it wouldn't
actually be used in a conversation anyway?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've kind of seen it as wood lovers are
categorized as that and everything else is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of in its own category.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we talked about being
coprotrophic or coprophilic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a technical term for manure
lovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you could say that those
cubencies in particular are coprotrophic,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I have never really differentiated it
like regular mushrooms or wood lovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of just are what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as we progress into research
and knowing more about these different
[SPEAKER_01]: species that maybe different names will
come about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to save most of our time from
this first set for the second and third
[SPEAKER_00]: set, which are going to be much longer due
to the nature of the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the last thing I want to ask you
before we go to our first commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: break, and I want to readily admit that we
may not have a good answer for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's true, feel free to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like I want to talk about
like the secondary alkaloids in wood
[SPEAKER_00]: lovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of excitement
about the rest of the psilocybe genus in
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, they've got these
aromatics and terpenes that we know are so
[SPEAKER_00]: important in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just now beginning to study them
in mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also there's all these like
secondary alkaloids that are rich and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can test for them in labs, but we don't
really know what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my question for you is,
does that same excitement apply to wood
[SPEAKER_00]: lovers as well, that they've got this same
aromatic and secondary biochemical story
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell, where they too are going to be
receiving a lot of aromatic research to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out what on earth they're doing other
than just delivering us psilocybin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all mushrooms are in this
category, you know, even if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: culinary mushrooms or the functional
mushrooms, as they call them today,
[SPEAKER_01]: lion's mane, shiitakes and others,
very aromatic, terpene rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, too, that the amino acids
deriving from tryptophan for these
[SPEAKER_01]: tryptamine alkaloids are extremely
exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of new research that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is research that was done clear back
in the 60s by a friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_01]: Albert Long, discovered BioSystem with
another colleague and Art Paul,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe his name is, and the research
stopped, you know, we could have been so
[SPEAKER_01]: far along 40 years later, practically,
you know, 40, 60, almost 50 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really sad, but now we're here and
I'm hopeful that, yeah, we're gonna find
[SPEAKER_01]: more research, we're gonna find more data
that's telling us, you know, exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: all these different amino acids are doing,
maybe why they're there, what the function
[SPEAKER_01]: is of it, and how can we use this in
mental health and other things for our
[SPEAKER_01]: physiological well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as like getting to know ourselves
and understanding who we really are and
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're doing on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right, so let's go ahead and take
our first commercial break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, our first set was all about like,
you know, getting to know what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about today and the wood lovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during the second set, we're gonna be
starting to talk about wild craft
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the third set, we're talking about
at home cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're gonna go ahead and take this
short break and we're gonna be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is mycologist, Christian
[SPEAKER_00]: Kaelin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, please support them and let them know
that you heard about them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Revenue is tight for cannabis businesses
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no question about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when revenue tightens, businesses need
to spend smarter on advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of throwing obscene money at
hanging your company's logo from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rafters at your next convention,
perhaps consider placing commercials on
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are a very small business,
there is simply no better bang for your
[SPEAKER_00]: buck than commercials on Shaping Fire,
especially if your products are for
[SPEAKER_00]: regeneratively minded cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_00]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from the
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and help our audience get in contact with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a commercial on Shaping Fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_00]: of their headphones right now,
and will continue to reach new listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: as they explore the Shaping Fire back
catalog of episodes again and again for
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spot on Shaping Fire costs less than a
postcard per person, and the Shaping Fire
[SPEAKER_00]: audience is full of smart cannabis
enthusiasts, cultivators, and
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs who are always curious to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now in the new year,
we are booking the few open spots we have
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love for you to be one of our new

[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard me talk about the
award-winning cannabis seeds that come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the analytical breeding program of
Seth and Eric Crawford, who founded Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Seth was a guest on Shaping Fire
in 2020 to talk about triploid genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC
seeds for home growers and farms as Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the Revolution Seeds at gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their high THC seeds are extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they will start to flower at 16
and a half hours of daylight instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: the typical 14 and a half hours of
daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means in most regions, your plants
will start to flower outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of July instead of the middle of
August, which means these photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: plants finish in September and not
October, totally upending the photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: seed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric took their prized early
flowering CBG line and bred it to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most desired verified genetics out
there, including Sour Diesel, Triangle
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, Wedding Cake, Chem Dogs,
Skittles, and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: These crosses all express powerful photo
period terpene profiles and THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you a great high.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTR Seeds has a new THCV line with plants
like Double Durbin and Gigantor that boast
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one THC to THCV, and people want
that THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTR seeds are very consistent,
true growing inbred F1s from stabilized
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred parent lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds are nearly homogenous and the
plants should all grow the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only one phenotype in every pack,
available as diploids and triploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric's company is still
family-owned, patient and
[SPEAKER_00]: employee-centric, and partially powered by
their two acres of solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can purchase these seeds and the
entire catalog of Oregon CBD seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: gtrseeds.com.

something revolutionary for your next
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor or outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an
all-natural fish poop concentrate with
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real fish poop is extraordinarily complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you adding the nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium your plants need
[SPEAKER_00]: to build mass, transport nutrients,
and enhance flavor, but fish waste is also
[SPEAKER_00]: packed with biological activity and
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add fish poop to your irrigation
water, you are adding life force,
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotics, and active microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microorganisms include a wealth of
various bacteria and protozoa which
[SPEAKER_00]: further enhance nutrient availability for
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because plants are limited by the absence
of any essential micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_00]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop is a naturally complete solution
that fills in the cracks in your
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer program to ensure you offer
your garden a broad base of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all fish poop is created equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most products with added fish waste don't
reveal their sources or lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop brand fish poop, however,
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_00]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: koi and tilapia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are even invited to tour their farm in
person or on their YouTube channel to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sort of transparency is wildly rare
in the fertilizer market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks behind fish poop are also
lifelong medical cannabis producers who
[SPEAKER_00]: have deep connections in the community,
donate more product than they sell,
[SPEAKER_00]: and support cannabis prisoner,
veteran, and patient collectives and
[SPEAKER_00]: charities.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get your bottle of pure fish poop,
go to fishpoop.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see their entire line of cannabis
products, go to ounceofhope.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fish poop brand fish poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is mycologist,
Christian Kalin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we were talking about
wood lovers, who they are, what they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: and where we tend to find them in
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're gonna talk about where we
tend to find them in the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna talk more about
wildcrafting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Christian, I personally have
only ever heard of wood lovers being grown
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I hear about wood lovers,
people are talking about either
[SPEAKER_00]: wildcrafting them, literally, you know,
walking in the forest and looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: them, or doing a version of, I don't know,
wild cultivation where people are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, intentionally inoculating their
yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they're outside,
they're not inside, but maybe they're one
[SPEAKER_00]: step less wild because they're,
you know, because they are intentionally
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculated or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they always seem to be more,
you know, these wood lovers always seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more of a wild type mushroom versus the
ones growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any, like, scientific reality to
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that just me and how I've come to
know wood lovers?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're right that they are generally
found outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is, however, a lot of
experimentation that's been going on over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last decade or so, even maybe longer,
with trying to grow some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties indoor with decent success.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to go through, like, a
multi-seasonal kind of situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Found outside in the wild or in landscape
habitats, as well as people intentionally
[SPEAKER_01]: making patches outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this habitat that generally happens
outdoors, because it needs to have seasons
[SPEAKER_00]: and it needs to have a big span of time,
what are these habitats that are most
[SPEAKER_00]: conducive to the growth of wild,
wood-loving psilocybin mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hardwoods, deciduous trees, those
substrates generally, any kind of wood
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate, leaves that fall off trees and
create more substrate, these are places
[SPEAKER_01]: where you'll find the adurescence,
actually, like we talked about before,
[SPEAKER_01]: found on the beaches out on the coast,
connected to wood drift that's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sand, more than likely, on top of such
grass roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, but technically the habitats are
generally very similar, grassy,
[SPEAKER_01]: woody, and you want to stay away from the
conifer evergreen wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is too acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could combine if you didn't have
enough wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can get away with combining
a little bit of hardwood with some conifer
[SPEAKER_01]: chips to make patches work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally just found around the
deciduous trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have definitely not found any
success using pine chips before.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a younger man and I did not
realize the importance of the hardwood,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, why isn't there this pine tree
working?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yeah, wrong game,
Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like we're looking for edges
of things, kind of like where the coastal
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses meet the coastal sand with wood
and where the forest with the forest duff
[SPEAKER_00]: meets the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a lot of these are found in
areas where there's a transition and so
[SPEAKER_00]: there are different varieties of nutrition
and habitat involved, yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're secondary metabolizers too,
so they're used to being kind of second on
[SPEAKER_01]: the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love to be the first on the scene if
you're intentionally trying to make
[SPEAKER_01]: patches and they'll do even better that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where you find them is taking the last
bits of the substrate and digesting it and
[SPEAKER_01]: then producing fungus or mushrooms from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you say not the first one on the
scene, you're talking about that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: other mushroom varieties that are the
first one on the scene, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, either mycorrhizals that are in the
roots of the trees and plants or other
[SPEAKER_01]: saprotrophs that are competing for that
top layer of lignin and cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always liked the idea of mushrooms
that there's so many varieties that really
[SPEAKER_00]: excel when they're playing well with
others, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can have some symbiotic
relationships there that are synergistic
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you can have others that are
definitely out competing each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the climate and
seasonal effects because that's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons why indoor cultivation of wood
lovers is so challenging and why people
[SPEAKER_00]: work so meticulously to try to make a
synthetic environment that replicates
[SPEAKER_00]: these seasons indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the mushroom's life cycle
generally and when do they fruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of environmental conditions
do they like other than just purely the
[SPEAKER_00]: location that we've already discussed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they can be very finicky when you're
trying to cultivate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mushrooms in general, a lot of times I've
noticed when people stress out trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow them, they want them to grow so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I feel like this is too much of
a stressful environment on the organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds crazy, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just letting, like trying to see what
happens in nature and mimicking that same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically just setting up, you know,
knowing what the species is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically breaking it back down into
three different categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a good culture, something that
you've either found in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do stem butt transfers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take the roots off the bottom of the
stem, put it into wet cardboard or other
[SPEAKER_01]: substrates and let that culture kind of
grow through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And transplant that into other new
substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's places out there where
you can start with spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, spores generally are legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can, if you know what you're doing,
you can, you know, start from spore and
[SPEAKER_01]: then have that broadcast out into a patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, most of these woodlovers
fruit in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to time it either six months
to a year before that harvest date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we go too far into the
cultivation, because all of third set is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be about cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, I want to, I want to narrow our
scope a little bit specifically about the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we have, we have mentioned,
you know, that there's a whole bunch in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Pacific Northwest, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, which tells me they like moisture a
lot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there, then there are varieties
like the ovoids, which are coastal,
[SPEAKER_00]: east coast, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which also tells me that they really like
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you were talking about some
variety earlier in the show where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is going on climate wise in
all three of these places, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, you know, creates this great
environment for woodlovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the woodlovers love a cold snap,
a winter climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of situation with like you're saying
a humid, nice, wet environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't have this cold snap
seasonally, this can change your harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: year to year in your wild, you know,
your wild harvesting, foraging,
[SPEAKER_01]: or also when you're intentionally trying
to make patches that timing of how your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your mycelium is digested.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much food source, you know,
you've given it, there's a lot that goes
[SPEAKER_01]: into the timing of both your mycelium
growing in the substrate and the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasonality of your season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not always certain that you're
going to get mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're playing outside is playing with
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're playing with nature, both in the
culture and in your temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically setting up a patch,
like we'll probably talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll talk about here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the, the location, your culture and
the substrate are the three main issues
[SPEAKER_01]: with setting up a patch that is going to
be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know why the cold snap is so
relevant to the fungus?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, I'm guessing that there's
some mechanism internal to the mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: that without the cold snap, it doesn't
have the gumption to fruit as much when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot of, even culinary
mushrooms are similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shiitake's rely on a cold kind of
primordial stage where the mycelium needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to get almost shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to come out of its normal
character.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that stresses the mycelium out to
induce fruiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are, and this can be oxygen
related, CO2 related, temperature related
[SPEAKER_01]: or humidity related.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot goes into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, you know, there, there,
these mushrooms like the moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then there's a certain point when
there's so much rain that, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the mushrooms are done for the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we have any understanding of,
of why the mushrooms like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: X amount of moisture versus X plus
moisture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do we understand at all what the
biology is where the mushroom finally
[SPEAKER_00]: says, all right, there's just too much
rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a lot of times temperature
instead of moisture that terminates the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found the, yes, if you have kind of,
if you have an intentional patch outside
[SPEAKER_01]: that isn't deep in like, you know,
a foot or more of substrate, then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: more susceptible to either drying out with
lack of water or being too swamped with
[SPEAKER_01]: too much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the wild varieties are just in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're more permeable to these
fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as it doesn't freeze freeze,
like a hard freeze generally is what
[SPEAKER_01]: terminates the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that makes a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually saw the biggest, um,
cyanescence patch I have ever personally
[SPEAKER_00]: seen, um, this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really surprised to find it in,
um, in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's awfully late here for the
Pacific Northwest for cyanescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend called me over and said,
here, you got to come over and check this
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ended up being this, like this very
large outcropping, maybe like 10 feet by
[SPEAKER_00]: eight feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just like, just like,
you know, I probably shouldn't say
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands, but like a whole bunch were
there, like the most I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I said, what, you know,
I was, you know, as a, as a citizen
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist, I'm like, what, what,
what's different here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, and then my friend told me,
oh, you know, I had this tarp on here and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, over all these wood chips to keep
the wood dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they pulled off the tarp and
there it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the tarp was providing this
extension of warmth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the ground was all soaked with
water, but the, the mushroom fruiting
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies were not soaked, which can,
you know, often lead to rotting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, it was amazing how a tarp
unintentionally put on a wood chip pile
[SPEAKER_00]: actually created this perfect environment
for the extension of their fruiting phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, which was just exceptional to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that or cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people layer with straw, anything to
kind of give a little bit of a insulative
[SPEAKER_01]: barrier to the extreme temperatures or
fluctuations in moisture will help a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a treat area that is a
natural canopy to kind of protect your
[SPEAKER_01]: patch from the sunlight in the summertime
or the rains in the winter time,
[SPEAKER_01]: then tarping or cardboard can greatly
increase the success of your patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, these, these mushrooms,
you know, we call them wood lovers,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but do we know why they like wood?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there some, I mean, clearly there is
some attribute in wood that for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: appears in hardwoods that doesn't appear
in softwoods that they, that, that these
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms, um, you know, appreciate,
do we know what this attribute is,
[SPEAKER_00]: which creates this like symbiosis between,
um, these philosophy mushrooms and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and hardwood trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've noticed hardwoods seem to
be a little, uh, conduce, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, you see a lot of different organisms
growing on hardwoods compared to conifers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all the lichens, you know,
I was just noticing the other day,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many lichen you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: All over deciduous trees in the Northwest
compared to conifers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, like I was saying, I think there's
some kind of a pH acid kind of thing
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's more to it with the,
the resins and the different protective
[SPEAKER_01]: layers that conifer trees have,
uh, compared to the deciduous trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm uncertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another aspect of it,
um, where people so often find,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, these mushrooms and others,
including for where I live, morels,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, when, when humans get involved with
nature, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like my first time ever having a
mushroom outcropping on my own property
[SPEAKER_00]: fruiting bodies was when we got a whole
bunch of wood chips for our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then in, in the spring,
it was like, boom, all these morels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I felt like, like wealthy
and abundant, you know, being able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a five gallon bucket full of, full of
morels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all like, man, this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I, I think that is also one of the
attributes of wood lovers, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, where if, if, if humans are,
are messing with the wood that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the wood lovers are in a symbiotic
relationship with it, they're more likely
[SPEAKER_00]: to fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're definitely, there's this crazy
thing with cyanescence where you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the wild, there's some kind of spore
load in the alder trees, but you'll never
[SPEAKER_01]: find cyanescence in an alder grove.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes humans interaction, taking the
alder, chopping it down, chipping it,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking those chips, using it in landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the spore load is what a
lot of us think that is in the bark or in
[SPEAKER_01]: a dead area of the bark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as we chip, we're spreading these
spores and then the mycelium starts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is how we're finding these
cyanescence in landscaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I know I'm about to ask you to
make a, you know, like a little conjecture
[SPEAKER_00]: here and I'm, I'm comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you've got a deep science background,
but I'm asking for a little bit of opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like, what do you think this tells
us about the ecological role of wood
[SPEAKER_00]: lovers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it, what you describe them,
it sounds like a job they're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's like, it was like,
Oh, you know, wood lovers have got a job
[SPEAKER_00]: to do in nature when, when trees are
damaged or something like, like you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of experience with these, these
particular types of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it vibe like to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I have a strong feeling that the genus
philosophy that we have this relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this, it's, it predates our
relationship with the bovine, the cows,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's the longest relationship
we've had with any other organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's something there that we still
are missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I'm uncertain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited by these wonders and mysteries
and, you know, just understanding all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different species on the earth is a
multi-generational task on top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents and all the different cool
things about each of those mushrooms and
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're going to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I find interesting
about studying wood lovers is you really
[SPEAKER_00]: need to have patience in a way that like
kind of old school science tests used to
[SPEAKER_00]: have patients because since wood lovers
have not very successfully been brought
[SPEAKER_00]: into indoor cultivation, you actually
have, you know, you have to set up your
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment, whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to let the whole season
go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see what the mushrooms do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me a lot of how, I mean,
we still do, but how people primarily used
[SPEAKER_00]: to breed cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, you know, you were doing your
cannabis through your full cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you got your new seeds,
then you, you know, would do that again
[SPEAKER_00]: the following year outdoors, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you were really only doing,
you know, one experiment or one breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project a summer because you were doing
this in cooperation with cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually lighting got improved
and we brought the cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started being able to do,
you know, three or four cycles in a year
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now we're breeding with,
you know, spreadsheets and laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about genetic
modified, particularly just, just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, analytically supported cannabis
where, where you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can take these plants and,
and, and, uh, breed them a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking that example and cross applying it
to mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting because so many mushrooms
can be, can be isolated and bred so
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly in a home lab, but the,
the, the wood lovers are going like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, we're, we're going to do this outside
our way only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, uh, you know, I'm sure that
frustrates a lot of wood loving
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I, I find that interesting
stubborn nature of the wood lovers to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like kind of a charming trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: With cannabis at what you took me to the
dark ages there for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As interest and ambition kind of pushes
technology, I think for sure the wood
[SPEAKER_01]: lovers are saprotrophic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, we know that, you know,
we can grow them, we can cultivate them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're like the opportunistic morale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were saying that it takes just
the right combination of different
[SPEAKER_01]: seasonality and substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make that all happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure as people experiment with
different things, just like cordyceps,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we weren't cultivating
cordyceps, uh, not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as people experiment with all the
different things that we kind of break
[SPEAKER_01]: these little codes of cultivation,
which is fun and exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the wild, which is, you know,
my main interest with these, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: wood lovers since, um, since, you know,
it's fun to find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're free when you find them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and, uh, it always feels like I'm
getting away with something when I find
[SPEAKER_00]: something out in nature that we typically
pay for, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter if it's a culinary
mushroom or, or, you know, bringing in
[SPEAKER_00]: nettle outside to make ravioli or
something, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally feel like I'm getting like
something from nature for free,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, are there any companion plants or
other fungi that we will often find with
[SPEAKER_00]: the wood loving psilocybin mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than, um, you know, just generally
hardwood trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, just the grasses and some of
the vegetation helps because it opens up
[SPEAKER_01]: the airways and the substrate,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have some plant life that have
root systems that can help in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those can help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not, but it isn't as kind of,
it's not, it sounds like it's not as
[SPEAKER_00]: specific as like, oh, this variety of
grass is necessary for the fruiting cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: of the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we find that in other types of
species, but there really isn't any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of companion plant that's, that's
necessary to the cycle I'm hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've, I've had Azure essence grow
in normal grass, not such grass,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so they, I don't think they're
particular to such grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just were opportunistic with what was
there in their habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we certainly won't be able to teach
identification of wood lovers on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in an audio only program today,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for, for folks who are very interested
in, in the wood for the, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: the wild crafting, um, you know,
just for the joy of mushroom hunting and
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps for the actual taking of,
of the natural bounty, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the, the signs that we would look
for to know when a, a wild wood lover is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is ready to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is it, is it as soon as you can
identify it, or is there a certain point
[SPEAKER_00]: where, like, if you come across a patch
and you identify it as, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: sign essence, where you're like,
like, that's what these are, but I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: come back in like five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, you know, it's,
it's for the newcomer, it's easy to just
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest everything you see because you're
excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you, you know, if you're in a place
where you're safe and you want to check it
[SPEAKER_01]: out and learn more, I, I would recommend
kind of letting things grow out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, your last question, you said,
uh, kind of a companion kind of thing
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that there are a lot of
Galerinas, the deadly Galerinas that pop
[SPEAKER_01]: up pretty close to a lot of the wood
lovers here in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do want to pay particular attention
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patch might not be all one species of
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are easy ways macroscopically to
identify these mushrooms so that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: be safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if nothing else, take a spore print
where you take the stem off the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cap and lay your caps kill side down
on a piece of paper overnight and see,
[SPEAKER_01]: analyze what the color of the spores are
the next day is a telltale sign,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they're poisonous or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, um, do you want me to go further on
identifying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually going to take one more
step down that same pathway, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's lots of ways to get
educated about, um, you know, mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you can join a mushroom group.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are videos online.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certainly some like really great
cornerstone books.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you are not only self taught,
but you, you know, you teach this at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the university level,
you are, you know, I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you know, technically a professor,
but you teach coursework at the college
[SPEAKER_00]: level, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are a professor at first far as I
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, so, so what for people who are new
to identifying mushrooms, um, what would
[SPEAKER_00]: you recommend as the best way to go about
learning about woodlovers identification?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, even though I'm self taught,
I have had a lot of friends that have
[SPEAKER_01]: given me firsthand knowledge by going out
and harvesting, I'd recommend joining a
[SPEAKER_01]: mycological group or even just being
online, the different social media
[SPEAKER_01]: platforms where there's groups that can
help identify things, taking pictures
[SPEAKER_01]: helps out a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having guidebooks, like you're saying
helps out whatever you can do to educate
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself both in the library sense and
books, but also firsthand knowledge of
[SPEAKER_01]: going out and foraging actually touching
these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, the way the STEM feels,
the, the smell of the mushroom even.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all kinds of different
characteristics that we can identify
[SPEAKER_01]: before consuming and taking the wrong
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so in set three, we're going to set
three is going to be the biggest set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to focus on, you know,
cultivating these outdoors on your own
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but before we go to the commercial
break, I think it's really important to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to talk a little bit about,
um, mushroom harvesting and the ecology,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, anybody who's interested
in mushrooms wants mushrooms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but wanting mushrooms now,
you have to remember that there is also
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting mushrooms later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other people wanting to
participate with the mushroom as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are the ways that we should
harvest mushrooms when we find them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild, which sets up a situation where
it'll encourage food further growth so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can wild craft them the next
season as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different culinary mushrooms,
uh, more so than the wood lovers,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, to be discretionary in the way,
the methods to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people that harvest chanterelles
will cut them because there's little
[SPEAKER_01]: primordial mushrooms behind in the STEM
area that will come back in weeks to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could have more to harvest in the
future that season.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these mushrooms are mycorrhizal,
so you're not going to damage them
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily by pulling them out of the
ground because they're in the roots of the
[SPEAKER_01]: trees and the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are other types of mushrooms
like the pine mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a mycorrhizal with the pine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matsutake, the pine mushroom,
the pine tree, and people rake around
[SPEAKER_01]: those trees and damage a lot of the
ecology around the trees by really raking
[SPEAKER_01]: up because the mushrooms are found under
ground generally in the duff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's generally with, um, philosophy
mushrooms, you're not going to have like a
[SPEAKER_01]: damaging effect unless people are damaging
the ecosystem around where the mushrooms
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so tread lightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't leave your, your garbage,
your, um, your stuff around and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, maybe leave a few mushrooms for others
to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to know though, that if we're
leaving mushrooms, um, it is because you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be kind to somebody that comes
behind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it isn't like culinary, which is where
I got the idea from the question where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're always like, you know,
only, um, only harvest a half to two
[SPEAKER_00]: thirds because you don't want to impact
the sustainable life force of the patch as
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like that's just not,
that's just not the way the, the biology
[SPEAKER_00]: works when it comes to woodlovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, a lot of times patches are just,
that season that are outside very rarely
[SPEAKER_01]: do I go year after year after year and
find woodlovers in the same area unless
[SPEAKER_01]: there is wood debris or plant debris
that's falling every season to help feed
[SPEAKER_01]: that area every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I didn't realize why I know that I
don't see them year to year, but I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: sure why, but it's because they consume
all of the nutrition in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting, I'm starting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have an area that you like
to wildcraft, you know, be a, be a steward
[SPEAKER_00]: and, um, you know, put, put cardboard and,
or forest stuff and, or local leaves there
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and help out its process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sometimes patches just don't work even
like you've done everything you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter what happens, the chips just
kind of degrade and, and they move away or
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll have a successful patch for one or
two seasons and you try to give them more
[SPEAKER_01]: food and something happens and they just
die off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a bit of die off here and
there, but there's also a lot of success
[SPEAKER_01]: season to season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that sounds so sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, um, this was all been a setup for
set three though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set three is probably why you're here,
dear listener and set three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we know who the woodlovers are
and where they are in the wild set three,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably going to be the longest set is
all about setting up a patch at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stick with us until after the break,
you are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is mycologist Christian
Kalin as cannabis regulations become more
[SPEAKER_00]: demanding and consumers become more
educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is increasingly important to avoid the
use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert has the beneficial insects,
mites and nematodes, microbials,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky cards and air distribution units.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to partner with nature to defend
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_00]: from chemical sprays towards clean and
natural solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1967, Copert has assisted growers in

[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the topics I want to share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has follow-up
posts to Shaping Fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Lowe's Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: my successes and failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my own garden, insights and best
practices from personal grows everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: and always gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab or for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Lowe's and join our
[SPEAKER_00]: online community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_00]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is mycologist, Christian Kalin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are in the big finish,
and probably for what you are here for,
[SPEAKER_00]: dear listener, because we're gonna talk
about how to set up one of these wood
[SPEAKER_00]: lover cultivation patches at your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gotta tell you, they are a lot of
fun to put together in preparation for
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I produced a few of my own, which you'll
be hearing about in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is sure a lot of fun, and I'm
looking forward to seeing what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit they show here in the winter,
or in this coming fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Christian, I think right at the top,
we should probably hit the legal aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: right here to get us off the hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that, be aware of what the
laws are wherever you're looking to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is true that these are naturally
occurring, but based on where you live,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could get in trouble for intentionally
cultivating them, or possessing them,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, God help us, selling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be really aware of what's going on,
because the rules are changing fast in
[SPEAKER_00]: different state, county, municipality,
all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Shaping Fire, we're an international
show, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though cultivation of these
mushrooms may be illegal in much of the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, because it's a schedule one
drug, that is not the case everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: where the Shaping Fire audience is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be smart, and either stay legal or stay
quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get yourself in trouble,
and be respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want anybody taking your property
from you or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also not making any claims to
what is legal where you happen to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be an adult about it, and make sure
that you are clear about what is legal in
[SPEAKER_00]: your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Christian, what are the key factors for
successfully cultivating wood-loving
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about details in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as somebody who is intimately familiar
with it, I'm sure that there are the major
[SPEAKER_00]: pillars that any outdoor cultivation has
to include.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are those?
[SPEAKER_01]: The culture is primary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you get your base culture from.
[SPEAKER_01]: What species is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it need?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have the location, the habitat,
the substrate to give it the best
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is that habitat?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that a listener is looking at
their yard, and they've got some variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the questions that I would be
asking myself when deciding what part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the yard to make my planting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you live determines how much going
out of your way you have to make your
[SPEAKER_01]: patch successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in the Pacific Northwest are places
where it's humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't get super hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are where they like to thrive
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in the best place, and we don't
have as many firewalls that we have to put
[SPEAKER_01]: up, so to speak, to give them the best
opportunity possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other places, maybe in the Midwest,
Southwest, arid places, not very humid,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have to make a lot of
different layers and put it in a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: location where it might not get direct
sunlight and go out of your way to give it
[SPEAKER_01]: the best possible chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's kind of it in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've described shade and also some
amount of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, where we live, the moisture
is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if somebody is looking at their
property, their first choice would be
[SPEAKER_00]: shade because they don't want the area to
cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then second, maybe they are looking at
the more damp part of their property,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the part of their property that's
maybe more wetlands or maybe has a stream
[SPEAKER_00]: near it or maybe has got a, you know,
during the winter, that's where water
[SPEAKER_00]: pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kinds of things,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to get soaked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want it in a flood zone and
you don't want it necessarily to be facing
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun all summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want it, you know, to be in a south
sloping area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all these things can make a huge
difference ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about what kind of trees they're
under?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know they love the hardwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we be planting them underneath a
hardwood tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely sounds like we should be
avoiding firs because their root structure
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely doesn't provide the environment
we're looking for, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's actually opposite because
you think that deciduous trees don't offer
[SPEAKER_01]: much protection in the winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can be just as kind of harmful
depending on the extreme the extremeness
[SPEAKER_01]: of your winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would think that having it in,
I mean, it's not going to hurt to have it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a deciduous tree area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just depending on what kind of winter
you're going to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen success around conifers just
because they are a shade tree basically
[SPEAKER_01]: year round.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this can be a very nice place for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're building your patch on top of the
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like they're going to impede
with the success of the patch because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're topically on top of the conifer
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't see any problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, bamboo is another one that
people have used a lot because bamboo
[SPEAKER_01]: loses its leaves every year, but it's also
an evergreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have shade year round, plus you
have a food source for your patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's cardboard and tarps like we talked
about before too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just don't have a location with
trees or any kind of shade, maybe even a
[SPEAKER_01]: building on the side of the house can
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then using topical methods, tarps and
cardboard and straw will greatly benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like we're talking about we
want, we want moisture, we want shade so
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't get too much direct sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we want food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so putting it somewhere where there's
going to be forest duff or leaves falling
[SPEAKER_00]: from above or, you know, plants that just
drop lots of like, you know, sticks or
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers or petals or we're looking for
anything that is going to drop on your
[SPEAKER_00]: pile and degrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be that way,
but that's definitely a plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of folks, me included,
you know, we start this, we'll be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we'll be, I'll be asking you to
describe this lasagna technique in a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but one of the main, the most
important input for the lasagna style is
[SPEAKER_00]: the wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what, what best practices are
there for choosing your wood chips other
[SPEAKER_00]: than it sounds like them being hardwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one that I first came up with was
being careful grabbing the, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the wood chips that come from like the
city parks and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because many cities used pesticides and
perhaps there will be chemicals in those
[SPEAKER_00]: wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but other than those, I'm not sure
what other, um, best practices there might
[SPEAKER_00]: be for choosing wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: What might you have for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to source from arborists,
you know, depending on where they got
[SPEAKER_01]: their trees from, there could be risk of
herbicides or other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally when you deal with here in the
Pacific, Northwest, we were a tree state,
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's lots of wood, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other places might not have that,
but I would say on the whole, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're getting wood chips from an
actual chip company, then generally they
[SPEAKER_01]: can be certified organic actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's in the wild, you know,
they're just a dollar here in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_01]: Northwest is what you'll usually find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're a weed tree for the most part,
they're everywhere and they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're free of contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, definitely want to know where the,
the chips came from, but I think on the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole, you know, even if they're in
someone's yard, people generally aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying their, their hardwood trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like plants and things down
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then also like just making sure
that the chips haven't been somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: where they've soaked up or they've aged or
they were from trees that were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already dead and decaying and had all
kinds of contamination in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be something you want to start
with nice, fresh chips that were from
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this may seem like a laughable
question considering we're doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: interview in the Pacific Northwest,
but, um, you know, not everybody has got
[SPEAKER_00]: trees like we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, somebody on Instagram asked me,
uh, during a discussion, whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: they could use bagged hardwood chips that
they use for smoking meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like just like bagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bagged hardwood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any reason why that would be
excluded?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just the lack of information,
maybe of not knowing where they came from
[SPEAKER_01]: or how they were handled would be the only
uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say any kind of chip,
basically, if you're willing to just
[SPEAKER_01]: rehydrate it, that's all that needs to
happen is just take dry wood and soak it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a bucket of water and get it as
hydrated as possible before you inoculate
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's talk about, um, uh, uh,
where to get our, our starting spores or
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, um, my favorite way is, um,
my favorite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sound like I've been doing this for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been doing this for one month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so in my, in that one month though,
I've made a, I made a few of these
[SPEAKER_00]: installations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, but all of them came from that
one patch that I mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: that eight by 10 patch, um, because,
uh, my friend was, uh, selling their house
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're all like, Hey, you know,
um, this is, this is, this patch is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably going to get ruined anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, feel free to come and
collect mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, we went and we,
we scraped the surface and we grabbed a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had like really nice, rich
myceliated wood chips and degrading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's what, you know,
we used for these patches that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've installed in the last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, that's a great source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can, if you can grab mycelium
from, the wild respectfully there,
[SPEAKER_00]: there, there's a great option,
but, but, you know, I, you and I talking
[SPEAKER_00]: casually, you've mentioned many times,
um, you know, getting spores and doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so maybe talk a little bit about where
to get spores because, um, even though the
[SPEAKER_00]: possession of, uh, these mushrooms are
illegal many places, oddly selling of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spores is not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get spores online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I, I don't necessarily plug
any one in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I've had spore syringes where there
weren't any spores in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hit and miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the wild west still,
as far as what you can get out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, definitely would rather find a wild
specimen and use fresh, a fresh culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh mycelium is the easiest basically to
get started spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're dealing with a lot of different
DNA, uh, characteristics and you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you start spores on
cardboard, even just as a low tech way or,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, broadcasting the spores into,
uh, wet wood debris can also help,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's, it's variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will get a couple spores to germinate
and then that mycelium is very kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: primitive in ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily the most aggressive
lines to start from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally when you start from a spore,
you have to put it on a Petri dish in the
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory, get really aggressive lines to
sequence out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might take three or four or five
months of transferring from plate to plate
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually get an aggressive line that
will fruit mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spores can be a legal way to get to
acquire the culture, but then you also,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, once you spoil, once you
germinate the spores and start mycelium
[SPEAKER_01]: that is considered, you know, illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things where,
um, if you can find it in the wild,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you have somebody that has a little bit
of a culture patch that you can borrow
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you can literally take a picture
piece of someone's patch and transfer it
[SPEAKER_01]: to your patch and have a successful patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you caught me off guard describing
purchased spores, uh, taking them into the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, into the Petri dish just to grow them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, does that have to be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can you just buy wood loving spores
online and literally go over to your wood
[SPEAKER_00]: chips and squirt it out, you know,
in drops all over your wood chips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, can you do it that directly or do
you have to grow it out first?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do it that directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just variable as far as your success.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're you generally when people buy
spores, they just are hoping to get one or
[SPEAKER_01]: two mushrooms that then they can culture
and have a fresh mushroom to culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, they can have a more
direct clone that's more aggressive that
[SPEAKER_01]: will fruit more mushrooms in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting from spores, you're generally
not going to get a very successful harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes time to get that mycelium to the
point of like a kind of a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when wild harvesting your start,
as I did, you're kind of, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're kind of stuck with whatever,
um, you have nearby or that you can borrow
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you are looking to have success
right off the bat, is there a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of wood lover that you would
recommend someone buy the spores of just
[SPEAKER_00]: to increase their likelihood of success?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're going to do it the janky way I
described where you're just going to like
[SPEAKER_00]: squirt the spores out of the syringe onto
the pile, because I know there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people out there like me who, who,
as soon as you said Petri dishes,
[SPEAKER_00]: their eyes rolled, you know, and they're
like, Oh God, I'm just, I'm just not that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to buy this thing and I'm going
to go squirt it on my pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to let it rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope for good stuff in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so for all of those people,
which include me, like, like, like is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there one particular variety that we,
that we might want to focus on that is
[SPEAKER_00]: more, I don't know, aggressive perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Azure essence are definitely more
technical as far as cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little more finicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sign essence you'll find more
frequently out in public and they are more
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like different substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll probably that side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say my top three would probably be
sign essence, Ovoids and Alenia as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the ease of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ovoids tend to fruit both in the fall and
the spring, which are really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They technically fruit more in the spring
than in the fall, which is kind of a cool
[SPEAKER_01]: thing because most fruit in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I've seen Ovoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really just aggressively consume whatever
substrates available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they'll, they'll consume evergreen
and other plant life and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: different wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're, they're a lot more aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like, give me something to
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, I would say maybe Ovoids
would be top, top on the list as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: ease and flexibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that idea that you get two flushes
a year or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which leads me to my next question,
which is going to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the wood lovers are known for
being fall fruiters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a reason why they don't fruit in
the spring as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, with, with many species
of plants, you, you, they, they will go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the same experience in the spring
because there's this, this window when
[SPEAKER_00]: the, when the temperature is right and the
moisture is right and, and, and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then in the fall they do it
again because the moisture is right and
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're like, there's two windows a
year, but then there's also lots of fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: and lots of plants where they're all like,
no, we are going to, we're going to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: during this one time of year and that's
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you better pay attention so you can see
the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so now you've just described the
Ovoids often have a spring and a fall
[SPEAKER_00]: flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the cyanescence I'm gathering is
really just fall and there isn't a spring
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those mechanics?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be an intriguing mystery to
solve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even really think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of anything really off the
top of my head of why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is one of the reasons why it
would be so cool to be back in college and
[SPEAKER_00]: be a mushroom nerd and suddenly be coming
into mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, when, when you and I
were, you know, in our twenties back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, you know, if you had this
interest, you had to do it like totally on
[SPEAKER_00]: the down low and you had to make sure
nobody knew about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you'd have your spot in the
forest or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and because it was not nearly as
acceptable as it is now, but now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we've got, we've got
universities with cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: programs and, and, you know, everybody and
their neighbor is into, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: functional mushrooms for this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great time to be in your twenties
or, you know, or, or at, at the start of a
[SPEAKER_00]: career and being able to go into this,
because there is so much research to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done, just like the question I asked you.
[SPEAKER_01]: On so many levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad that I was able to see it in
my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting a little worried there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hopefully it'll all continue then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so the next thing I want to do is,
is, you know, I, you know, you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you taught me how to make these
installations from, from a wild crafted
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelium source.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of me talking about it,
I would love you just to walk us through
[SPEAKER_00]: the steps of making a, what we've just
started calling on the island,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lasagna installation, which is a little
wordy for what it is, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but at least everybody knows what
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so the assumptions I want you to
start with is we have identified a place
[SPEAKER_00]: on the part, on the property that has got
some tree cover and yet it's on the edge
[SPEAKER_00]: of the, of trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it gets partial sunlight during the
day and that it's going to be moist most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the season, except for maybe during the
drought part of the season where you might
[SPEAKER_00]: have to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we've got a decent place and we
have identified some hardwood chips that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we've got our hardwood chips and
we've got a couple of shovelfuls of
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation related mycelium that we found
in the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please walk us through how to do the
install at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, there is a precursor to this patch
that can be very positive in the success
[SPEAKER_01]: of your future patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, you know, with kubensis
grows, monotub is kind of a frequent word
[SPEAKER_01]: that you might hear, but it's basically
just a plastic container that people start
[SPEAKER_01]: their mushrooms in and growers that are
experimenting with woodloving varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: are having good success with starting
their mycelium in a monotub basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you, you have your mycelium that
you've got from a friend's patch or
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever out in the wild, you could layer
a little piece of cardboard down on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of the plastic container to kind of
be an absorption of excess moisture,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as like a platform for this,
the culture to really run through the
[SPEAKER_01]: paper and have a nice foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that as mushrooms are used to being
in the ground or inside something and then
[SPEAKER_01]: growing outwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to have your mycelium at the bottom of
your container and then growing outwards
[SPEAKER_01]: at the top is seems to be a little more
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like you're saying, the lasagna
layer is just a, you know, a metaphor for
[SPEAKER_01]: creating layers in your container of
different substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with your mycelium at the base,
then you want another fresh layer of
[SPEAKER_01]: either sawdust or sawdust mixed with wood
chips or just wood chips and then layer
[SPEAKER_01]: more wood chips, maybe a little bit of
sawdust.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have it, you could even use straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your straw doesn't have, you know,
if you can find organic straws best,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't have herbicides, but you can
layer straw in with your wood mixture as
[SPEAKER_01]: well to kind of give it a little different
airspace so that there's, you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to create like a anaerobic condition where
it can't breathe, but creating enough food
[SPEAKER_01]: source that that mycelium will just keep
rising up through your substrate until it
[SPEAKER_01]: reaches the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is like your spawn that you
can take clumps from this monotub of spawn
[SPEAKER_01]: of substrate and then use that as a seed
or a spawn for all the patches that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a better way to increase
your culture before you actually get
[SPEAKER_01]: started in your patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't want to go through that
process and you're just excited to start a
[SPEAKER_01]: patch, you basically do the same thing
just without the plastic container
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, you found your location.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to saturate some cardboard
in water until it's completely soaked,
[SPEAKER_01]: put your culture or your mycelium down on
that, gives it a nice platform foundation
[SPEAKER_01]: to leap off of, and then layer up your
chips and your sawdust and chips or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you have available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe top it off with a little bit of
cardboard on top to protect it if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have a lot of tree cover or a wet
straw, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were doing our installs two weeks
ago from that source I was telling you
[SPEAKER_00]: about, somebody asked me how many layers
they should put in their lasagna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just doing three layers because
that's how much mycelium inoculant and
[SPEAKER_00]: cardboard I had, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But does it, does it matter whether it's
two layers, three layers, five layers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is there, is there any analysis in
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more food that you give your mushroom
or your mycelium, the longer it might take
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually fruit because we have to
remind the viewers that mushrooms are like
[SPEAKER_01]: the last reproductive cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the mycelium and it thinks it's dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's creating a mushroom to create
spores to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in essence, trying to give it
just enough food to really grow out,
[SPEAKER_01]: make the mycelium strong and get it to the
point where it's ready to burst and start
[SPEAKER_01]: creating these little mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a lot of timing and
experimentation in your area of like your
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, how fast it's growing through
your substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might take a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or two seasons of like experimenting to
see, Oh, I should have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this season it, the spring, it was really
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my patch in late.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got really hot in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dried out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's, there's lots of
different variables season to season,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I technically think the more,
the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have to wait longer for your
harvest, but the more substrate and the
[SPEAKER_01]: more layers that you put in, with,
um, a lot of, if you can create your
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium first, like I was saying in the
little plastic tub, then you, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: really inoculate heavily with mycelium in
a lot of substrate that then will create a
[SPEAKER_01]: really aggressive, robust patch that will
potentially fruit for a couple of seasons
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd start bigger than smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're really serious about trying to
get a successful patch going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it can be, there's so many
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why, you know, kind of,
you're kind of giving us like a loose
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then depending on where we
live and what materials we have access to,
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of apply that recipe, like however
we can, where we live.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had never heard the idea of
starting, um, your mycelium in a mono tub
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really interesting idea because
you're kind of creating an incubation,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of, or like, you know,
we talk about, um, uh, uh, aerated compost
[SPEAKER_00]: teas a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take your basic, uh, oxygen loving
microbes and you're putting it in your,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your, uh, bubbler and then you're
bubbling it so that you make a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot, a lot more microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you, and then you put that on
your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of the same thing where
we're talking about, okay, we've got,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got this, you know, shovel full of
mycelium and we, we want to make a big
[SPEAKER_00]: patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put it in the mono tub with a
whole bunch of, um, hardwood sawdust and
[SPEAKER_00]: chips and cardboard and let it grow
through the tub so that when we go to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the outdoor installation, we're not just
using one shovel full.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, you know, this, this quarter of
a tub full and we're like, hell yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really great idea, especially if
you only have a little bit to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to ask you, how much do you
think like when we say a lot or a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: how should people think about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how, how do they know how much they
have to make their installation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's use, let's use me as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from, so from this huge eight by 10
area, we didn't even take like half of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we got five, five gallon buckets
full, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was like, I, to me that sounds
like a ton of, you know, myceliated,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, mushroom or wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we, we took those five and then
we split it up between five locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we used, you know, more or less a
five gallon bucket along with the other
[SPEAKER_00]: cardboard and, um, hardwood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now using that as the example was that
like, you know, is, is a five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket, like a whole ton where,
or where we only need a little bit kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like think it through for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I would say a five gallon bucket of
myceliated chips would be enough spawn to
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can stretch it out however you
want, but to make a nice successful patch,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think more is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So amplifying your mycelium, like you
said, in the Tupperware and then using
[SPEAKER_01]: like, or a five gallon bucket,
and then maybe a four foot by four foot
[SPEAKER_01]: squared space, almost two feet in depth of
substrate would be like a five gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of an oculum, you could maybe do like a,
you could push that to five foot by five
[SPEAKER_01]: feet or, you know, whatever you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the depth of the substrate too is
something to consider because,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that mycelium needs to get mixed into
the bottom all nice and thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you want it all to kind of expand
out together instead of having a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: patches that aren't colonizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I'd say five foot by five
foot for a five gallon bucket of my son.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so if we have a five gallon bucket,
we know we have tons of, we know we have
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of myceliated wood chips and,
and we're clear, but, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: give us an idea of what is the least
amount that we should try to start a pile
[SPEAKER_00]: with without trying to incubate and make
more in a mono tub first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we only have a, you know,
a one shovel full, is that just like two
[SPEAKER_00]: precarious low amount to like try to make
a three foot by three foot bed with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and we should definitely go with the
mono tub first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like give it, give me a threshold
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know when we have too little
amount to go right to nature and we should
[SPEAKER_00]: incubate first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I always tell my students to
push the boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have what you need,
maybe go a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, shovels worth of really decent
mycelium would probably be able to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: three foot by three foot, um, by two foot
little patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, I, it just depends on the
culture and how aggressive it is and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the different variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to promise anybody,
but I would say you'd be on the safe side
[SPEAKER_01]: to still be able to have a significant
patch just with the shovel full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that's a lot less than I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really opens up the door for a lot
more folks because God knows it's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to find a small patch than it is
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that big one that I stumbled upon,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which will be, you know, given out to
people on the Island for, for years to
[SPEAKER_00]: come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, um, a little, little side point on
the mono tubs, people actually grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit in the mono tubs as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're creating these little mini
habitats within the mono tub, actually
[SPEAKER_01]: having maybe a little grass seed on top,
producing a little carpet so that they
[SPEAKER_01]: have like this ground cover essence,
but it's still all in a mono tub
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're fruiting out of the mono tubs,
but it is a seasonality thing outside
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're keeping things outside,
but they're cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to drill, drill holes for
drainage in the bottom, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually sounds like a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not, I'm not like a big proponent
of like, like, like let, let's add plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: tubs outdoors, but, but it sure sounds
like fun to like, to do it with this more,
[SPEAKER_00]: a more controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone has a backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or access to a yard or they live in an
apartment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a question about the two foot depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that got my attention because none
of the five we made was two feet deep,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, each of them, they all ended,
only ended up like, you know, 12 or 13
[SPEAKER_00]: inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, if, if they're, if,
if we're building this lasagna on bare
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, does the ground count for some of
this two feet?
[SPEAKER_01]: If the ground is soft and has the same
kind of substrate that the mushroom likes,
[SPEAKER_01]: then yes, it's okay that your patches
weren't too deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need more care in the long
run to make sure that they don't dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the summer, definitely go out there
and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you might want to put a cardboard
layer over the top in the extreme heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you water, you're watering your
cardboard that then helps create a humid
[SPEAKER_01]: environment for your patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the less depth in your patch,
the more care is going to take throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the year just to make sure the extreme
temperatures don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens with aquariums too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have a little aquarium,
the environment of the aquarium changes
[SPEAKER_00]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got a, you know,
a big hundred, 200 gallon, it really takes
[SPEAKER_00]: a more push to change the environment that
the fish are in kind of the same thing for
[SPEAKER_00]: this patch as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so straw, straw would be another good,
uh, ally.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're, when we're watering,
we're not going to be using municipal
[SPEAKER_00]: water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it might have chlorine or
chloramines in it, which I'm guessing
[SPEAKER_00]: messes with our mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to capture some rainwater
and use that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, chlorine definitely is problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get some, some growth,
but it just tends to inhibit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have, if we don't have,
if we don't have access to rainwater and
[SPEAKER_00]: our city is using, um, you know,
you know, Chlorine and maybe fluoride,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it reasonable for us to just pick up
some, uh, you know, distilled or RO water
[SPEAKER_00]: and just use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just know, know it's kind of like
neutral water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can leave their normal water out in
five gallon buckets too, and just let the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the chlorine evaporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you leave buckets of water
out for, I don't know, maybe a week or
[SPEAKER_01]: two, um, then you could use that as a
watering agent too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have access to clean water,
that's not chlorinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've already talked about,
uh, you know, several different issues of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that could go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is there any other big challenge in
growing these woodlovers that we haven't,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, addressed for, you know, as far as it
goes for the patch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, uh, something that I should have asked
you about that I haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I mean, you're pretty thorough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it helps that you taught me this
just a few weeks ago, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so it is, it is kind of fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right, so let's, let's talk about
the next fun part, which is the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so they're, they're, they're
growing up and you've got your caps and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, generally speaking,
uh, do we want to, we, do we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest when the, when the veils start to
break and the, and the, and the caps start
[SPEAKER_00]: to flatten.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to harvest earlier than later,
generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny with the woodlovers,
a lot of times they cluster together so
[SPEAKER_01]: tight that it's hard to not just pull up
huge clusters together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll, you'll have some kind of
immature ones and some mature ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you generally will just start
harvesting the patch all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if your patch is big enough,
you might, it might take you a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: days or something and you can just kind of
start taking the more mature mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you're working through it,
they just keep maturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like more, uh, younger specimens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the caps don't just break apart into
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have these nice, beautiful
mushrooms, but I'm into the aesthetic look
[SPEAKER_01]: of them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they look really cool together when
there's lots of different stages of growth
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's, I mean, it's cute,
but you can wait, um, wait for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: flatten out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think that, you know,
they might get a little more weight from
[SPEAKER_01]: that or something, but I, I feel like
that, you know, if anything, you might be
[SPEAKER_01]: degrading the content, the potency of your
fruit bodies by waiting longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know that some mushroom varieties,
once the veil is ripped and it starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: drop spores, this sporulation gives a
signal to the substrate to stop fruiting
[SPEAKER_00]: our wood lovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those variety of mushrooms where
we, you know, we really want to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: from dropping too many of the spores
because it's working against us.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not that I know of, um, that patch
just, it'll just keep, keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll, you'll have some contamination
from spores sometimes where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just creates kind of a dirtiness that
will, you know, it, it degrades the
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom caps when they have large spores
from another mushroom cap on top of that
[SPEAKER_01]: cap kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it can degrade the mushrooms
quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten that in my mono tubs and it's
like, Oh, it makes them very unattractive
[SPEAKER_00]: looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still work, but it's just very
unattractive looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for wood lovers, do you recommend,
um, harvesting, uh, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: with like, you know, a razor blade around
the bottom where you're leaving the base
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil or are we good to just like
pop them out and take some of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: with us and then just clean them up in the
house?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I generally do the ladder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then you can save those little
stem pieces, the little roots and
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant those and create more mycelium
or give them to friends or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people will wash the roots off,
you know, the stems and try to salvage as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Maria Sabina, um, back in the
day said, you know, don't cut the feet off
[SPEAKER_01]: because the little saints, those feet are
important too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so go, you know, if we're going to
pull them up, go ahead and cut off the
[SPEAKER_00]: feet and clean them up if you're going to
do that for yourself, but then take the
[SPEAKER_00]: feet and reintroduce them to your pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, giving, giving back to
your pile and being as efficient about it
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're starting those little mono
tubs and creating more mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, so let's, let's say now you've
got, um, you know, uh, a couple of paper
[SPEAKER_00]: plates or whatever, full of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you recommend going about,
uh, drying them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously we're talking about in a
non-commercial application here,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just talking about somebody's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you recommend they go about
drying them out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just your typical dehydrators that you can
buy online or at stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they can just be a simple little
electrical heat element in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have the racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be black trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be round or square.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people will just make a mini at
home dehydrator by, you know, creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: little box with a fan and room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your house is around 68, 70 degrees
with a little fan, that can be enough in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little container to dry out mushrooms,
as long as they're on a screen or
[SPEAKER_01]: something that allows breathability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't suggest using the oven much
because ovens have too high of a low
[SPEAKER_01]: setting to really, you know, it tends to
kind of get too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heat, heat can be damaging to the potency
of psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we want to evaporate them,
not cook them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so now that they are dried,
um, how do you recommend the storage of
[SPEAKER_00]: these mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, I know that storage
could be a, you know, a third of a show in
[SPEAKER_00]: on itself, but, but considering we're to
this part of the show, and it's just for
[SPEAKER_00]: personal use, how would you store these so
they last long list?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's differing research out there that
says that potency is maintained through
[SPEAKER_01]: like 50 degrees and, you know,
limited humidity at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to have any kind of
degradation in the potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also kind of a side that
says like freezing fruit bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could also be long-term storage,
but then there's also a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: information out there saying that freezing
actually degrades psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of differing opinions and
information out there right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as, um, storing long-term and room
temperature freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think both I've had good results in
both, uh, at room temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're not sealed up completely and you
were growing outside, there is chance of
[SPEAKER_01]: fly larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, germinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So freezing can technically keep that from
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your, your mushrooms would last
longer in a dried frozen environment
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than, uh, taking a risk with fly
larvae eggs in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I haven't run into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's common in the culinary
world with morels and porcinis where
[SPEAKER_01]: people will have a beautiful mason jar of
morels or porcinis and they come back a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of months later and it's just
powder because everything's germinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a freezer will not allow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I will add that I have,
I have added to my best practices that I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like is, um, they, they sell these,
um, vacuum seal devices for large mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: mason jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can, you can put whatever,
you know, cannabis or mushrooms into your
[SPEAKER_00]: mason jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put the, the mason jar,
the lid on, but then you put this device
[SPEAKER_00]: over the top and you push a button and it
sucks out all of the oxygen from the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it seals the flat part of the two
piece lid to the jar because, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, the, the things that
destroy these mushrooms are, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not only, uh, heat and,
and bright light, but also oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you, if you jam your mushrooms
into a jar, and then, and then remove the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a, there's a small ratio within
the jar, meaning that your, your jar is
[SPEAKER_00]: packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a small amount of mushrooms
to a big jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then you vacuum out all of
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, you know, just throw it
underneath your bed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in a dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, more or less temperature
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're in a non oxygenated
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be good until your,
your next round of fruiting the next fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mention freeze drying either.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little more expensive, but they do
make the desktops that are a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable for the homeowner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the freeze drying is pretty amazing
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the research is as far
as potency levels, but the texture and
[SPEAKER_01]: just what the mushroom looks like after
it's freeze dried is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's fresh basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is actually really remarkable
how, how it doesn't, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't do the shrivel thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, all right, Christian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, um, we're going into the wrap up
here, but I want to give you a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of wax philosophical because,
um, I have heard you do that before and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and also you're, you know,
you're pretty, because you are still very
[SPEAKER_00]: much in the mixed, both, you know,
at the, you know, with the academic part
[SPEAKER_00]: and the science part, and also the
entrepreneur part, you know, your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your thumb is definitely in the
mushroom pie as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so wrapping up what future research
directions do you find most promising,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, for understanding or utilizing these
wood loving psilocybin mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now we focus on their,
their beauty and their ability to heal,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like we're just, we're just at the
beginning of our relationship,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, with this mushroom since we're,
we've started learning the actual science
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so what excites you looking into the
future of wood lovers and our relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: to them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a deep question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we didn't touch much on wood lover
paralysis and I think probably cause I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, so go ahead and address that if
you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's kind of been my little
mission of late because Oregon is banning
[SPEAKER_01]: the use of wood lovers for mental and you
know, for whatever reason and their new
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation for legalizing basically
everything, but they're not going to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: wood lovers because of a wood paralysis
that happens in people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, does it happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say it does, but it's,
it's, I, I'm a little uncertain about what
[SPEAKER_01]: it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everyone else kind of is
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no real understanding as of yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just kind of, uh, people's
opinions and experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people just feel like within an
hour of eating, a lot of times they're
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh, fresh mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times they've been in New
Zealand and Australia with the
[SPEAKER_01]: suboriginosa, uh, which I think is,
uh, you know, a super potent mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be part of why there is
paralysis because, you know, anyone that's
[SPEAKER_01]: taken a large amount of mushrooms can feel
paralyzed throughout their experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's like this physicalness or
this, um, in, in your mind, in your
[SPEAKER_01]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, I'm, I, I, I'm interested to know
more about if there is a physiological,
[SPEAKER_01]: paralytic response in people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but more so, I, I just think
psilocybin and psilocin and general and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these different precursors and pro
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's my interest in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been intrigued with the
different varieties of psilocybes and why
[SPEAKER_01]: each one has its own kind of
characteristics as you ingest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, ovoids, they grow in the spring and
they have just this nice, uplifting,
[SPEAKER_01]: energetic, lightheartedness to them,
playful almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: As if, you know, as a spring like mushroom
would give you, um, the Azure essence is
[SPEAKER_01]: just knock your socks off and melt,
melt your face off, go lose your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your name and, and who you are and,
and come back to find out who you really
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's so much, um,
within this genus to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, we've delayed the research
for way too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much that we're doing to
our world and to ourselves and so much
[SPEAKER_01]: unrest that I just, I feel like this is
kind of the last hope in ways for us to
[SPEAKER_01]: get together and understand why we're here
and who we are and how to like group
[SPEAKER_01]: together to be like mushrooms,
to work symbiotically, to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that don't serve us and,
um, understand the true meanings of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, that's, you got me going
deep there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it, I, you know, you and I've been
friends for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it doesn't take much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, um, I mean, this molecule does
this, like, um, this, this, there's,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a bigger thing, you know,
this, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a recreational thing that
makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's, there's a lot more to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that more and more people that
are scared of it or that are tentative
[SPEAKER_01]: that, um, they would come to the forefront
to, um, legislators and people that need
[SPEAKER_01]: this, that can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's, there's nothing to fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, Christian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for joining us
today on shaping fire and sharing your
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise and, you know, heart,
your good heart with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's really nice to talk to somebody
who is, um, you know, clearly a scientist,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also is firmly grounded in the,
you know, the ecological and heart
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with the mushroom as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, it's, it really makes for a
different interview than somebody who is,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, coming at it direct only as a
scientist and, and, and your well-rounded
[SPEAKER_00]: nature with mushrooms, um, really came
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so thanks so much, Christian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate having you on shaping
fire.
