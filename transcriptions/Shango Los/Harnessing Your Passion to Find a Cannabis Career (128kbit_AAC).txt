[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microphone really gets it going,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like right on the edge of even
needing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks, first of all, to David and Kara
for introducing me or for, not introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: me, for inviting me to come and speak with
you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the host of the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also the founder of the Vashon Island
Marijuana Entrepreneurs Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked on Vashon Island to find new
channels for product for our medical
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, which is now wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the organization still exists as an
educational organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a former brand strategist and
then CEO of Green Line Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a longtime Canvas business
consultant for both medical and 502.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point of the talk today is going to
be to suggest a strategy that you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: to find a job simply because of the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start in a really kind
of an odd place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start with, are you sure
you want a job in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, if you're here,
you're pretty sure that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to go through this because
part of the idea of the talk today is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to leverage your passion for
working in cannabis to get a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by going through this quick little
exercise, we'll rev up your passion a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, do you really want to
work in cannabis because you've got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when it comes right down to it,
working in cannabis is working at a
[SPEAKER_00]: startup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working at startups is really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a normal job where you can
punch in and punch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when you're going to get paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any of that in the cannabis
industry yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after 18 years, we never had that in
medical ever either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can probably expect a good five
to 10 years before we get anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks close to stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk for a second about the
downsides or the challenges of working at
[SPEAKER_00]: a startup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be the kind of person who's
going to be down with working on
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpected duties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the kind of person who's like,
well, that's not my department,
[SPEAKER_00]: working at a startup might not be for you
because you are going to essentially be an
[SPEAKER_00]: employee in every department.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be a grower, but some days you
might need to do packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be a packager, but some days
they might need you to file stuff in HR.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be an HR person and you might
end up doing deliveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're the kind of person who's
going to be all like, well, startups might
[SPEAKER_00]: not be for you because you've got to be
willing to wear a lot of hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you live so close to the bone
that if you get paid a couple of days
[SPEAKER_00]: late, you may want to have awarenesses
around that too because so many 502 folk
[SPEAKER_00]: are also running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So close to the bone that I see constantly
folks are, you know, one day, three days,
[SPEAKER_00]: a week of late simply because their
cashflow is such a drag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you were going to get a job at a
highly funded company and they even have
[SPEAKER_00]: an HR person and you know, the likeliness
of that definitely goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more often than not, the 502 companies
are doing everything they can on a
[SPEAKER_00]: shoestring and making their capital go as
far as it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they just made a big purchase so
that they can process it into product,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may end up, you know, rolled the dice
and lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, we don't have
payroll for like five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, as an employee, you need to
be willing to suck it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't mean let your company take
advantage of you because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are all our own company, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to defend our own,
you know, rights in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, there is such thing
as taking one for the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, having your payroll be a
little late is something that happens at
[SPEAKER_00]: startups all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to have like little emotional
flexibility on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, there is the hours,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of variety of the
kinds of jobs in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hourly jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are pretty much, you know,
you do your hours, you get paid for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if you get a salary
position, you need to understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a certain amount of that that is
open ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are paid salary for as many hours as
you're needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now granted, you may decide that the
agreement that you made with your employer
[SPEAKER_00]: is not something that you're okay with
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you decide to leave because they're
asking 60 hours for 40 hours of pay,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes your hourly wage atrocious,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's something to be said for sweat
equity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I started the Vashon Island
Marijuana Entrepreneurs Alliance,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't getting paid at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I never got paid for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was because I put in the time to
make it happen that I learned the
[SPEAKER_00]: connections and got the networking done so
that then I could launch the rest of my
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting career and podcast and all this
other cool stuff that's happening now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, if you're getting a job at a
startup, you know, expecting to only work
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 hours is probably a little unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 50 is probably a little more
realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're the kind of person who's
like, you know, it's five, I got plans,
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta go pull some tubes, I gotta go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's not really the kind of
startup mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting high because almost everybody
in the industry does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea that you've got somewhere
better to be is the part that I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go into it with like,
I only want to do my own job and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else to be, startups might not
be the thing for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also, you need to be aware that working
in cannabis has got some challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, being judged by other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people who are working
in cannabis, they have to deal with what
[SPEAKER_00]: their aunt said or what their grandparents
said, especially if you're hoping to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see this all the time where people
have got challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh man, cannabis is my
passion, but my family's like getting down
[SPEAKER_00]: on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you need to get an apartment,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're applying for a new apartment
and they look at your job and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, I don't know this company,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, nope, we don't want your
kind around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if I would say that, they just
wouldn't call you back, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how about going to apply for a car and
they find out that your income is from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry and they don't want to
go fill the cannabis money, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in to pay off your car loan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those of us who are cannabis
business owners, we're still having a hard
[SPEAKER_00]: time finding banks that will take our
money anyway so we can pay you your
[SPEAKER_00]: payroll, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these kinds of challenges are all
doubled down as far as being a startup
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, there is risk involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis companies go down all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is high risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's moratoriums that suddenly make
your company illegal in the county that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an exceptionally high risk job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they don't even have to
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes all they have to do is just
reorganize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can reorganize and decide,
you know what, when we hired for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: we hired nine people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what, we think we can do it
with three people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that it frees up six
salaries to do other things, and now we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go hire a bigger sales team.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be on the low end of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are the challenges and the
risks you need to be prepared for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you heard all that and you're
like, yeah, I can make all that happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, then we get to talk about the
upsides, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because working in cannabis is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am very lucky to have lived in a
time where when I worked in the dot com
[SPEAKER_00]: boom, they said, you know, we all have
these once in a lifetime jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've got two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got twice in a lifetime work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've got two brand new industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can handle all that risk we were
just talking about, well, number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get paid to work legally with weed,
which is awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the kind of stuff that we used to
joke about high in college values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someday, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now we're living someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so also, being involved in a brand new
industry, it's titillating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are participating in building
something that hasn't existed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, you get to put your
mark on an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help make the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is not very often that you get to
participate in an industry where you will
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to play a role in making the
rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in itself is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, outside of your compensation
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is a certain advantage if
you're the kind of person who likes to be
[SPEAKER_00]: on the edge to be able to work in
something that's taboo, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like it when I tell people what
I do for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of see, you know,
the people who don't immediately ask me
[SPEAKER_00]: for a job, the other folks are kind of a
little gasped, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool, because I like to get
that reaction a little bit, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Being brought up in the Midwest maybe
causes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, there's other really important
things, like fast upward mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no other industry right now where
you can move up in the ranks faster than
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already seen people who started a
year and a half ago as a blood tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly, now they were like the
supervising blood tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were moved into the
operations manager, and they were opening
[SPEAKER_00]: and closing the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they got poached by another
company to help run operations in the
[SPEAKER_00]: processing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they've got, you know,
a real salary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, okay, well, do I want to
stay here in Washington or do I want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm being poached to come to in
Nevada, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The talent pool is tiny, tiny right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once you get your foot in the door,
if you're doing a good job, you can expect
[SPEAKER_00]: a quickly upwardly mobile position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it means that you can switch
companies pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there is kind of a certain
amount of glass ceiling being a blood
[SPEAKER_00]: tender, because there's only so many,
so there's only so high to go in retail,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so much room for advancement
for people who are already working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, that if you have done a good job
at a blood tender, you understand the 502
[SPEAKER_00]: rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've proven that you've got
management skills, it's very easy for you
[SPEAKER_00]: to jump to another company and be able to
move through a blood tender glass ceiling
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of this linear
mobility between companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And managers are used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like other industries where
they're all like, you're leaving this
[SPEAKER_00]: other company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to leave us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I'm probably going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you might get two years out of me,
and you need me, and I need you,
[SPEAKER_00]: so let's dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to a certain degree, working in
cannabis is like musical chairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: where folks who are attending this event,
they're coming in, and then they're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: musical up, and then up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the folks who come to an event
like this in a year, they're going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: in, because we're all new.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows for a lot more
flexibility, and honestly, negotiation in
[SPEAKER_00]: your compensation package, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I touched on this a
moment, but the skills you learn here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington can be worth mad money in
another state in a very short period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very lucky that we are in
Washington, because we can get our start
[SPEAKER_00]: here before all the other states have even
gotten out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is not uncommon now for me to
see people who started their gig in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, they were huge into learning
about their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They studied every aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stayed after.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took positions of management,
and they learned jobs that weren't theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they got a reputation for being
good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now they're being headhunted by a
company in Ohio, or Florida, or Arkansas,
[SPEAKER_00]: or wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a friend of mine recently got
headhunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now suddenly, he's in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in Chicago, and he's building out
five extraction facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they treat him like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is a rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got mad skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he started, he was just an
extractor that people respected in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's national news stories
about his bad ass company in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still in the early days of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industry, where if you get started now,
you can earn your stripes in Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then go to another state where your
family lives, or where you like the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you just want to explore, because maybe
you grew up in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, with that, now we're all very
firmly established the fact that we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about being a cannabis,
and we really want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the formula that I have used my
entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually learned this from my folks
growing up, and I've used it in all sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: of industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works really, really well in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the part of your taking notes
you're going to want to take notes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the best tactic to find the way
to the job you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose the company that you want to work
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wait for them to post a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important for you to answer the ads
when people are asking, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: low-hanging fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ad that you're responding to,
thousands of other people are very likely
[SPEAKER_00]: responding to that ad as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the company sat up and said,
we're looking for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get this deluge of resumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you're just in with everybody
else, and you're not really all that
[SPEAKER_00]: special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it harder to get the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it harder to keep your job,
because we got them from an open call.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get somebody just like them,
again, doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes time to let people go,
unless you've really made yourself look
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive to the company, you'll be one
of the first people they get rid of,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you were easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that time and time again,
that being able to stay at a company a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time, you can start that with day one
and how you find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flip the script.
[SPEAKER_00]: By choosing the company that you want,
and the job that you're interested in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then going after it, very literally
start by making a list of 10 companies in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that you want to work for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you feel hot about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you think they're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the kind of extraction technique
they work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that they respect their employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're into a diverse environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is that you feel is attracting
you to that company, make a list of 10 of
[SPEAKER_00]: those companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean make a list of three
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you make a list of seven, and then you
kind of run out of gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through and push, and find 10 companies
to target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the secret is in the numbers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The more people you contact, the better
you're increasing the likelihood that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to find a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if when I said, you know,
think about the companies that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with based on what they do,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're like, well I don't know what
these companies do, or I don't know why I
[SPEAKER_00]: like these companies, well then you
haven't done your homework yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do more homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: These companies want to hire somebody who
already has an awareness of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you don't have to come from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to at least understand the
differences between the companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out who the people are behind the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they do business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are developing your taste in a
company that you want to work for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can tell them why you want to
be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you've got this list of 10
companies, do your homework very
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically about those 10 companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of each one of them as a target.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend finding out who the
visionary is at the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out who that principal is because
they're all going to have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have the person who had
the idea and put it together and decided
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's those people who will be most
responsive to the resume that you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to send them that says, I am passionate
for how you chose to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're passionate about how you
chose to do things, you're already getting
[SPEAKER_00]: your foot in the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The visionary will be like, oh,
he loves or she loves the decision that I
[SPEAKER_00]: made myself to run my company this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a warming up point for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, after you've done this research,
you've got your 10 jobs, or 10 companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to work for, and you know
who the visionary is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to write your cover letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're assuming that you already
have your professional experience page
[SPEAKER_00]: written out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you need help with writing a
resume, the good folks at Verde and
[SPEAKER_00]: Staffing are the people to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really what we're talking about
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to write a cover letter
that is unique for each individual
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they can have the same spine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't want to take the same one
and just go 10 times, send it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to write that resume,
the cover letter, that says why you think
[SPEAKER_00]: their company is badass, why you want to
work for them, and what you think that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can add that goes along with what you
respect about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an extractor, talk about what
you like about their extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: why you hold it in esteem, and what you
think you can add to their team.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an awesome administrator or
middle manager, tell them why you like how
[SPEAKER_00]: their company is run, or their brand,
or even their product line that you just
[SPEAKER_00]: think they've got great pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is that you love about that
company, write that in a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when we write cover letters,
we write them in such a way so we sound
[SPEAKER_00]: businessy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You clean up your language and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do that to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're writing a passionate cover
letter, speak from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to use that business
narrative language all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you think about it,
the person who's reading it, they are in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, they started their company
because they're jazzed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them hear some of your excitement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get rid of the jazziness in your
writing voice just to sound more
[SPEAKER_00]: professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because honestly, there aren't a lot of
professional folks in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really not a standard that a
lot of people are going by.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to shut up the work on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to know how to interact with
your other employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want you to be able to do your job
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a level of professionalism is not
something that is really a big demand in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And use that to your advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that I learned today from
Kara from Viridian Staffing during her
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction for the folks that are here
today, she mentioned don't put in your
[SPEAKER_00]: cover letters that you're a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back when Washington only had
medical cannabis, it was important that we
[SPEAKER_00]: all put in our cover letters that we're a
patient, we get patients' needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to be involved in taking care of
your patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that medical has gone away,
if you put in your cover letter that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are a patient and so you identify with the
needs, you're putting the employer in an
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable position because you're
coming up against all sorts of laws that
[SPEAKER_00]: make them not be able to tell you no
because you may be sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to not mention that you are
sick and that you're using cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your own business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's better for the employer to not
know that because their concern will be,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what if we bring them in for an
interview and they bomb the interview and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we say no and then they come back to
us with a suit saying, ah, it's because I
[SPEAKER_00]: got, you know, whatever you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just won't call you because they
don't want to even play with that risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: a lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't mention your patient if you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so after you have attached this
fabulous cover letter that you've written
[SPEAKER_00]: with passion about the things that you
like about the company because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted this company and you've done your
homework, now you send it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the part that people kind of
roll their eyes about because we are
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about redundancy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that you try to get
that letter in the hands of the decision
[SPEAKER_00]: makers any way you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first and most obvious, you're going to
put it in an envelope and you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: send it to the principal, the visionary,
the person who started the company so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they receive it with their mail and they
open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the most reliable way we have to
get it in their hands, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to do that same thing but
you're going to send it, attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: HR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can figure out who the HR
person is, if they even have one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, more power to you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could even call them up and
say, what's the name of your HR person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then write it down and say,
like, now you do it because you've done
[SPEAKER_00]: your reconnaissance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've sent them two letters,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've sent one to the principal,
one to the HR person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but, you know, they may not like
paper, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you want to do that same thing
via email.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can find the emails of the
principal that's really great,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how many principals have got
their emails public because they spoke at
[SPEAKER_00]: some event or they're on an email list
that's online or, you know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: So search them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search out their name and the word email
and see if you can find it easily that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, if you can, when you're on your
phones, you know, kind of sneakily calling
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you know, ask for the HR person's
email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will likely not give it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll say, oh, please submit your
resume via our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but, you know, maybe you've got
somebody covering for the receptionist
[SPEAKER_00]: who's actually usually rolling joints and
like, oh, man, her address is boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, thank you, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, take advantage of the chaos in
the system to your own advantage,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you've sent this four different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've sent it via mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've sent it via the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've sent it to two different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're going to drop it off in
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of these, you know, they may not
have facilities that you can tour or get
[SPEAKER_00]: into, but most of them have got a front
door that you can open and startle the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell out of everybody that they've got
walking traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll print it up on a decent
printer, put it in an envelope,
[SPEAKER_00]: and drop it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always suggest putting the visionary's
name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I probably wouldn't drop off two,
not one for the visionary and one for HR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put the visionary's name on it
because chances are the reception's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to open in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, now you know that, boom,
you made sure you delivered it themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of the pushback I get from some
folks about this is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that redundancy is going to annoy them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're successful, they've now
gotten five communications from you that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want a job from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in this many, in this amount of the
time, that might work against you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But number one, chances are they're not
going to get all five communications from
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're either going to not see the emails
or it's going to come in the mail and end
[SPEAKER_00]: up on somebody's desk and forgotten or,
you know, they're going to get the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've handed them at the front door
and they're going to take it with them to
[SPEAKER_00]: lunch and then it's going to get lost in
their car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are they're not going to get,
you're not going to successfully ping them
[SPEAKER_00]: five times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe they'll see two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll see three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you are only in the game if they see
your resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes, you know, they say,
you know, a brand doesn't really sit with
[SPEAKER_00]: you until you've encountered it three
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe you'll make a purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same goes for getting a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time the visionary sees your
resume, they may not even read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second time, they're like,
man, this person's insistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third time, they actually
read it and they're like, that's a damn
[SPEAKER_00]: good cover letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can feel their passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at their work experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person likes my company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like what I did with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they seem like they're passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, kind of cool to have
around the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call them in for an interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bam!
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're, that is the goal of
what we're trying to get that interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you can do that best is by
doing everything you can to get the resume
[SPEAKER_00]: in the decision maker's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then finally, I suggest following calling
in a week and asking to talk to the
[SPEAKER_00]: principal, the visionary, the HR person,
and see if you can get somebody live on
[SPEAKER_00]: the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're calling to follow up to
make sure they got your resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you don't damn well they
did, because you sent it five different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But this creates an opportunity for them
to say to you, oh yeah, we did get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was supposed to call you and set up an
interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad you called me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are making that person's job easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to do everything we can to make
their job so easy to hire us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, your job is to get your resume
in the hands of the decision maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that gives you kind of a
whole different thing than, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: my job is to get a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to break that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your job is to target 10, do your
homework, send it to them redundantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and follow up and make that opportunity
where they ask you to come in for the
[SPEAKER_00]: interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that your passion and your
interest and your skill set is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: shine when you're in your interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to get to that point first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are done, you will have 10
really great resumes with awesome and
[SPEAKER_00]: passion cover letters in the hands of 10
different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to be ahead of everybody
who's not in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in this room, there's a lot of folks
who are going to hear the strategy and
[SPEAKER_00]: then not do it because they don't have the
fire to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do it, you will be in the top
2% or 3% of people who are looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: job in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really all you need is you need
to have something that the other people
[SPEAKER_00]: are not doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this strategy is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why does this work so well?
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a plan on how you are going to
get a job is more than just anybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: has got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having this plan, working the plan,
working it through to the end is
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing your own secret to success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when you're sitting there in
the interview and you're talking to the HR
[SPEAKER_00]: person or to the principal and they're all
smiling because they got three copies of
[SPEAKER_00]: your resume and they read your letter and
they're like, man, you really targeted us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here because we read the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're thinking to yourself,
I did that for nine other companies too,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're not going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they're seeing, they're seeing
your excitement that you can get things
[SPEAKER_00]: done, that you've got follow through,
you've got passion, you've got a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make an awesome employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interview's already half done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to make sure that you're
not like a serial killer at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so good luck with that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I want to also say, yeah,
go ahead and apply for the other jobs that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are applying for too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not a big fan of keeping all
of one's eggs in a single basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply for the jobs where they are listed
on Monster.com or Craigslist or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not really where you want to
spend the most of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do this kind of a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you are being assertive and you're
going after the job you want, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the jobs that are listed on
Craigslist, those are the jobs that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available and you're like, well,
I guess I could take it to get my foot in
[SPEAKER_00]: the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might need to take a job to get
your foot in the door anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how much cooler is it to go to a
company that you already want to work for
[SPEAKER_00]: and apply for a job that you want to do
instead of just taking the low hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit of what's on Craigslist and going,
well, I guess I could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aim higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you get a lower job,
be grateful for that gig and then get that
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and start maybe buying another
company and then do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are so many jobs that are not
advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize that the majority of
the jobs are not advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one has time to write or post the
job listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, this is so common.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably not a dedicated HR
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one likes hiring staff, except maybe
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you are taking the initiative,
you have solved the challenge they have of
[SPEAKER_00]: no one wanting to write the damn ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a job posted somewhere,
but you have not seen it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you're looking at all the common
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whoever is doing the thing,
they're using their brother-in-law's
[SPEAKER_00]: employee employment website that none of
us have heard of, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, we've got the job
posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure why we haven't gotten any
resumes in yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so suddenly, they get yours in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, booyah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's interview them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's that possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are about to let someone go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk to 502 owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all got that one employee that
they're like, I would love to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have time to write the ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just not ready to let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they would really like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, give me a reason to let them
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's because they break
something severe or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, OK, I got my reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe the reason could just be that
you showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you are causing the impetus to
create room for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe they have an employee they don't
like, but they've not decided to let them
[SPEAKER_00]: go yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they haven't even really thought about
letting them go, but they just don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
And they get your resume that says,
I like you.
I like you.
I like your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm badass at what you need to hire me
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like this other employee,
but I didn't realize that there was an
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative until you gave them the
alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're creating these opportunities that
didn't exist before for them to hire you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they need help, but they've not
really thought about hiring somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they've got their tight team of five
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how they've done it for the last
eight months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been working their butts off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it never really occurred to them,
well, you can make your life a lot easier
[SPEAKER_00]: if you hired another person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these companies don't
actually have a lot of budget to hire
[SPEAKER_00]: another person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the amount of cannabis being sold is
going up and up every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: These companies that have not been in the
black are now starting to get in the
[SPEAKER_00]: black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it hadn't occurred to them,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should hire somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe they don't have an ad out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they read your cover letter,
they're like, well, I think it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: hire somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my favorite is the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how I've gotten the majority
of my jobs in my life, and definitely all
[SPEAKER_00]: the kick-ass jobs I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that you win.
[SPEAKER_00]: The visionary gets their hands on your
resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: They read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, hell, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person gets me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make a job for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has probably happened eight or
nine times in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after, I'm always asked to speak
to my friends' kids about this strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear back from them, it's like,
oh, so-and-so's a snowboarding company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't even hiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when they got my resume that said
I'm a snowboarder, and I love their
[SPEAKER_00]: company, and that I've been to
competitions, and I've rooted for their
[SPEAKER_00]: teams, and they asked me in for an
interview, and they made a job for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm delivering mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm in at Burton or wherever,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of being able to reach the
visionary who can very literally with a,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, bring them in for an interview,
create a job for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of power in reaching that
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happens all of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two, four, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are six different ways that a job
could exist for you that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the company who's hiring you doesn't
even know they need you yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why the strategy works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your odds are also way up, because no
one else is applying for a job this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chances are, they may not even be
getting very many resumes, because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of folks take the low road.
[SPEAKER_00]: They respond to the Craigslist jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they send those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come to something like this,
because they're like, oh, I can get up and
[SPEAKER_00]: go and be there for a few hours on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not a lot of people are putting in the
effort to target companies and go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of work that we're talking about
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, the strategy I'm talking
about, this is not a lot of work,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do most of this in an afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to stay focused and not let
yourself get distracted and stay sober
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the time commitment is not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it is, it's the heart commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm talking about getting a
job in Canada is with your passion today,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is you activating your passion to get
something done, because you've got clear
[SPEAKER_00]: intent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that clear intent will come through
your cover letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will just explode all over the
floor in your interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Canada's jobs are a game of odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: By targeting the companies that you want
versus taking the ones that are applying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are increasing your odds of getting a
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: By writing your great cover letter,
you're increasing your odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by being redundant and getting to
them, you're increasing your odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are serious about doing this,
increasing your odds and decreasing your
[SPEAKER_00]: risk is how you want to play this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be the only person in
the room doing that for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen this work time and time
again, both for myself and for people that
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with and for folks that I consult
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really amazing, because now I
know so many people who own cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many of the visionaries,
they feel like people don't hear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand their vision
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all stuck with the day-to-day
operations, BS stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not getting to necessarily do
all of the passionate stuff that they kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of envisioned at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the end, the fantasy of working
in cannabis or the fantasy of starting a
[SPEAKER_00]: job in cannabis is very much unlike going
to work every day, especially if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the visionary, you're working
seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to have your resume come in where you
are speaking the secret language of why
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing is cool, people respond
to that in a very serious way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest that you do each step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not put this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And follow through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because just sending them the resume may
not be enough without you following up and
[SPEAKER_00]: calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a little bit extra time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take three questions if anybody's
got some questions for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Dave.
[SPEAKER_03]: You list 10 companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I live in Bellingham.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there might be four.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would send resumes down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But moving down to this area is very
expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they probably wouldn't want to meet my
salary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dave says, what if there are not 10
cannabis companies within your area to
[SPEAKER_00]: commute?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk about this in other
industries, what I recommend people do is
[SPEAKER_00]: you take a map and you kind of draw an
outline of where you're willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: commute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you find companies within that
area that you think are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that works a lot easier when it's not
just one industry, if you've got more
[SPEAKER_00]: flexibility in your industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we're talking about only
cannabis, what Dave's talking about is
[SPEAKER_00]: correct, especially if you live in a
county with a moratorium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, Dave's saying that
there's only four cannabis companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are close enough to commute to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, just write them even
better for those four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't exist yet, you can't write
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as part of doing the R&D to get the
job, watch for new companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the landscape usage boards
that go up before they set up a shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you write to them before they even
exist as a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that the cannabis companies are
not evenly distributed around the state
[SPEAKER_00]: means that anybody in King County
generally is in a way better position than
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's way north near the Canadian
border.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another sub-question is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about finding out who the visionaries
are by going to your local pot store?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of creative ways to
find out who the visionary is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find out who they are by looking
at interviews that they may have done in
[SPEAKER_00]: Dope Magazine or Northwest Leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search the company name in a LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even call that same receptionist
that gave you the HR person's email
[SPEAKER_00]: address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can say, oh, I'm calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the name of the person who founded
the company?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll probably give it to you pretty
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be a little creative about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these visionaries have got a nice
dose of ego, which you need to run a
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, they're usually
somewhere out and about talking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: badass their company is anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: My best advice for somebody who wants to
start their own cannabis company is to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something that does not require a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest companies to run are the ones
that are licensed by the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana testing would be a good
alternative.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you need to get certified by the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't necessarily have to get a
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hoops that you have to go through to
obtain your processor license or your
[SPEAKER_00]: grover's license or, God help you,
a retail store, and just to have where you
[SPEAKER_00]: live, I have a moratorium, the regulations
are so ugly in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the opportunities are so rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: In corollary industries, maybe you're
going to invent the new super cool bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you want to do a lifestyle brand and
put out clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the hemp wicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knew there was an industry in hemp
wicks?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a couple really great
companies that are making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invent something really cool that dabbers
are going to love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbers have got so much discretionary
income to be able to buy the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will buy your cool invention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so similarly with services,
maybe you are an accountant at REI or a
[SPEAKER_00]: bookkeeper at REI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you love REI and stuff, but you want
to do something a little more edgy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe you start a service firm that
specializes in catering to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now suddenly you're the first person
that does your specialty for only cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you're doing that while you're
still working at REI.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing this one day a week or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be my best recommendation is
to find something that you're excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about that you are willing to sell and to
try to stay out of anything that requires
[SPEAKER_00]: a license at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you had the interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've taken in your application,
had the interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the call back that they're not
moving forward at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is a company you really want to
work for.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's appropriate at that stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's answer that question a couple of
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's asking what happens if you have
your interview and then they say no
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing would be if you really
want that company, apply again in six
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three months is a little bit on the
fast side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might decide that you're an irritant
and you don't really want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these companies, they radically change
every couple months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in six months, the person in HR who
interviewed you may not even be there
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And their needs and maybe they just got
another round of financing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they can hire a lot more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back to the same company that you're
all juiced about in six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more to your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, what was the specific part of your
question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's your answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do next?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second part is go look for a
job at a different company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sweat it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because except for maybe where Dave lives
where there's only four companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's lots of cannabis companies where
we're generally like here we're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle land area, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just don't get too bummed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I certainly have got like two or
three brands in the state that I think are
[SPEAKER_00]: super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I was looking for a job,
I would go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they told me no, I'd be like
crestfallen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the game is not to only be able to get
a job with Solstice, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The game is to get a job in cannabis,
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you interview with the super cool
cool, and they're not ready for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't mean that you're a bad person
or you're not ever going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means it's not the right fit right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go back to them in six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the meantime, shift to somebody
else on your list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are into this kind of idea,
you can find out more kind of stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: this by listening to my podcast shaping
fire, you can get on that list at
[SPEAKER_00]: shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you can contact me through my
website at shangolose.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let me plug some other things that are
going on here today as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: At two o'clock, we're going to have a
panel right here with some live cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: business owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about their
preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk to somebody who is
hiring for sales, somebody who's hiring as
[SPEAKER_00]: a processor, a serial job applicant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a visionary here in the flesh
to kind of, you know, confirm what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been saying to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, if you are the kind of
person who wants to attach a headshot,
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually got somebody taking headshots
for 25 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, hopefully you dressed
appropriately today and you've got your
[SPEAKER_00]: smile on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I'm around if you want to talk
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
