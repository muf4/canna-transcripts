[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, this should be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome to the 230 presentation on auto
flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please silence your cell phones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been having a lot of problems with
that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Shane Galos, host of the Shaping Fire
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like listening to smart interviews
with the top minds in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to check out the show at
shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have an extraordinary YouTube
channel with over 150 speaker videos I've
[SPEAKER_01]: recorded at events just like this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This presentation will be posted there
next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are postcards in the back near the
door to help you remember the name,
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: The upcoming presentation is titled,
Success with Modern Auto Flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis from Shane Galos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it looks like since I'm moderating the
room today, I'm also introducing myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: A summary of the points that we're going
to be talking about today is number one,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to talk about who is likely to
benefit most from auto flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about where autos come
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about the most common
objections to auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will point you in the direction of
some quality breeders and where to find
[SPEAKER_01]: more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the important thing to start out at
the beginning is to realize that even
[SPEAKER_01]: though auto flowers have become awesome,
there's still a lot of variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, a lot of things I'm going to say
float somewhere between best case scenario
[SPEAKER_01]: and the better seeds that are on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people righteously hate auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those folks generally come into three
categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either they were growing autos back in the
day of the low rider days when it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: cool idea, but the yields and the terpium
profiles were atrocious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, it wasn't very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, they got a bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we all know, reputations are hard to
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second challenge can also be that a
lot of people judge autos just like to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow freaking trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And auto flowers have not really hit that
point yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then third, some people are just using
seeds that are not as well developed as
[SPEAKER_01]: other seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the vast majority of what I'm going to
tell you today is kind of based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting edge of where auto flower seeds
are, but is not representative of every
[SPEAKER_01]: seed in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's really important to do your own
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not one of those situations where
you're all going to be like, this pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds says auto flowers and I want an auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I'm going to buy a whole bunch of
this one seed and devote my entire crop to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend you getting a lot of variety
of seeds from different folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a trial and then decide, okay,
these are clearly the ones that meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: needs that I'm looking for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruderalis crosses are not something that's
new.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's new and why everybody is talking
about it today is because the latest seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that come out by some of the top companies
are just smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are part of a very particular
audience, they could be, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: very literally life saving if you're a
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're going to first start with by
talking about cultivators who are most
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to benefit from auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, my heart is always
with home growers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do business consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I help commercial folks as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really at my heart, I am patient and
home grower centric.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're going to start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one reason why home growers
adore auto flowers is because their speed
[SPEAKER_01]: from germination to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a handful of different lengths
of time depending on the chemo bar at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, they fall into 16,
90, or 120 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you who were here for
Jess' presentation earlier, you got to see
[SPEAKER_01]: his pictures of how fast a 60-day plant
goes from germination to being prepared to
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really astonishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's crazy, too, when people talk
about a 60-day auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're used to regs flowering for
eight weeks, you're like, oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, that's just like a regular plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, no, I don't mean 60 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the entire plant to flower,
I'm talking about 60 days from germination
[SPEAKER_01]: to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at around that point is where
people start.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of start to see the mind get
blown a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, wow, how many rounds could I
do in my tent?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many rounds could I do outside?
[SPEAKER_01]: This summer, for example, I did two
rounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did one round that I popped in April and
harvested the end of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put some more in the middle of
June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to be harvested the end
of September.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm getting two cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one summer with no pain in the ass
light down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing is that, of course,
where the flowers get their name,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get their name because they do not
flower based on photosensitivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most cannabis plants, they will start to
flower sometime mid-August when the light
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle gets down towards nearish 12-12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we live in the Pacific Northwest,
it never gets to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, most of our plants kind of like crawl
into flowering at about 13 and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: hours or so, which is one of the
challenges of growing in the Northwest and
[SPEAKER_01]: another reason why these auto flowers are
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: What triggers auto flowers to flower is
more maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the early days, people were telling me,
it's when the roots hit the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pot and it causes them stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even repeated that a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I toured Oregon CBD seeds farm in
Albany, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got all these fields full of
beautiful flowering auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, how far do their roots
need to go down in order to hit the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this can't be right information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I stopped saying that and got further
educated and found out that actually no,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's when the plants hit their maturity
level, they just automatically go into
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes a lot more sense both
scientifically and observationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another reason why home growers really
like auto flowers is that home growers
[SPEAKER_01]: have got a lot of unexpected things and
short opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, let's say that you're moving
and I hate it when I want to move,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have my grow, but we're going to
plan on moving September 1, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'll get all my veg in, but before the
plant even finishes flower, somehow I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that means that you're going to rent a
U-Haul and move all your plants and hope
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't break off all the branches
and go through all that malarkey or you
[SPEAKER_01]: just don't grow at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for people who are home growers,
the idea that you can say, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move September 1,
so I'm just going to make sure that I
[SPEAKER_01]: plant June 1 or May, mid-May and be like,
hey, now we harvest it and move into my
[SPEAKER_01]: new place instead of my new tent and start
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's other opportunities like
let's say that your roommate doesn't like
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, cannabis around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're concerned about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you rightly want to respect
their interests at the house too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to take off on vacation for
two months with their family and
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, fine, you're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grow a 60-day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you're getting like totally weed up
while they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the kinds of things that,
you know, you have to be aware of when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, another thing is that the plants are
very naturally resistant to pests and
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies due to their short cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, I experienced this last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last summer, it was the first year that I
really legged into auto flowers and I
[SPEAKER_01]: realized that the cycle was so short,
it didn't give me a lot of time to eff it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's, you know,
I'm a novice grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a pro grower and I'm not a
breeder, but what I am is a student and I
[SPEAKER_01]: care about it and so I do my research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, so what I realized after I grew it is
like, wow, about the time that it starts
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, so, you know, we all know that when
you're using rags, one of the things are
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to spray during your
flower, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that means that you have to be very
proactive for pests and botrytis and PM
[SPEAKER_01]: during your veg so that you can kind of
hopefully coast and maybe even upgrade to
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial insects during the flower to
get to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if that's going to be 8 to 10 weeks,
that's a long time hoping to keep,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the plant in good shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, if the entire life cycle of the
plant is going to be 60 or 90 days,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a much smaller window that you
have to not screw up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, for home growers, you know,
that's a real benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got lots of home growers that
they're new to growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new in their state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just learning about cannabis
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for whatever the reason is,
just because you want to grow does not
[SPEAKER_01]: mean that you need to have, you know,
given yourself an epic amount of education
[SPEAKER_01]: on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto followers are just that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you know, because the plant are
crossed with the ruderalis plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we'll talk about in more detail
about where it came from, it's a hardy
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's from the nether regions of
Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got small stomata on the bottom of
the leaf that makes it less likely to get
[SPEAKER_01]: molds and pests, which is just helpful to
any home grower, especially a new grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any extra, you know, points to your
advantage you're going to take because
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes the plants just feel like they
take forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got so much invested in it as a
home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sure, you've got, you know,
the things that you purchased and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using the room in your house or in your
yard, but also home growers are very
[SPEAKER_01]: emotionally involved with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it myself firsthand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like adding extra kids into
your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, you know, the unzip the tent,
hey, good morning everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've grown at home, you know you've
done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, when we have that kind of an
emotional connection with the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're only growing four or eight
plants, using auto flowers are helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: because it makes the entire process more
manageable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, they're easier to fit in a
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, growing in tents are fine
and, you know, we can top our plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep them short.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is something really nice about
being able to choose, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: between two and four auto flowers in a
four by four tent and grow those all at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time, instead of committing to
one or maybe a second plant that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to become monsters in a four by four tent,
because you've got less chemo bar choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got less strain choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when the stuff comes out of the
jars, you won't have as much variety to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I find that I'm really enjoying
growing four autos in the soil in a four
[SPEAKER_01]: by four tent instead of one plant that's
going to be really large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, they're easier to hide in your yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for those of us who live in
neighborhoods, we want to be respectful
[SPEAKER_01]: for our neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, if we are growing in
a state where cannabis is not allowed,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if, you know, we've got picky
neighbors, or we've got neighbors who will
[SPEAKER_01]: want to smoke all of our weed,
we just don't want them to know,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, one of the beauties is these
plants are, you know, generally shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of variety, as I said at
the beginning, about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: between the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have seen plants that top out at two
feet consistently, but I've also got other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that top out at four, four and a
half feet consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the crazy thing is, is I've used some
folks seeds and within the same pack,
[SPEAKER_01]: some will top out at two feet and some
will top out at four feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's some of the variability that
you've got to look for when you're buying
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before you commit to a lot of any
particular seed, make sure you do a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a run of 10 or whatever to,
before you go ahead and do a whole field
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also smaller sized, meaning that
they're going to produce less smell for
[SPEAKER_01]: your neighbors if that's a concern for
you, especially if you're an apartment
[SPEAKER_01]: building or you're living in these like,
you know, tall, thin townhouses where
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's in really, oh, differentially
close, let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's a smaller plant,
but because it grows so swiftly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do two rounds of small plants to
replant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great place, what you may have
done before trying to do one large plant
[SPEAKER_01]: during the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the great thing is, is that even
though they are smaller plants and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get less overall turps to bug the
neighbors, the turps on the plants can be
[SPEAKER_01]: very excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is a variable thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all breeders are at the same place
with the lines that they are working.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certainly standout breeders in
the scene right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's important to know,
though, that even though I'm saying your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors won't complain as much about the
turpines, it doesn't mean that the
[SPEAKER_01]: turpines are poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means that the plant is smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, they're easier to hang to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, some people like to take
their large monster trees, maybe cut them
[SPEAKER_01]: in half and just, you know, hang them in
long rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most home growers don't have that kind
of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly you can take a tree and hack
it down to individual branches and hang
[SPEAKER_01]: all of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when push comes to shove, home growers
are almost always short on space.
[SPEAKER_01]: The picture that you see here is actually
my own bedroom last summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I pulled my stock and hung them
above my bedroom because I live in a one
[SPEAKER_01]: bedroom house, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only space of my house that was
not being used actively was the air space
[SPEAKER_01]: above my bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Note to self, I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year because I realized that this is
totally a JV error.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I realized that when you cut plants
and you hang them during the first week,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the inhabitants come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was getting crab spiders and other
spiders and who knows what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were all repelling down into my
bed as the plant was dying, as it was
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's so sketch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to really impress your
significant other, explain to them that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's going to be repelling spiders
coming down into the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just 10 days, babe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also great because a lot of us who
are home growing, we're working a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just no question that the
otter flowering plants take less work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cycle is shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not as big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can easily call them cute,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, they really just take
a lot less maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And growing regs, I have been in the
situation where I'm working my day job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe I meet a friend after work
for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go home, and the rest of my
evening could be in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just making sure that this reg plant of
mine, which I'm all in on, because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: only going to get one round, is going to
be in good shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the otter flowers, I find that
I'm spending a lot more time just sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: around with them, looking at them,
enjoying being a cultivator and being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to interact with, for me as my medicine,
I had a brain injury in 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that there is something
very heartfelt about growing your own
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And otter flowers give you more of the
enjoyment and less of the hassle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that is it for home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to a subset of home growers,
which is going to be patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually where I spend most of
my time working with patients on Bachelon
[SPEAKER_01]: Island, where I live, and traveling the
country to talk to doctors and naturopaths
[SPEAKER_01]: about how to use cannabinopathic medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So patients, of course, really enjoy all
of the stuff that we've already mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: about home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that stuff easily cross-applies to
patients who are growing at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason why I was originally
attracted to otter flowers is because the
[SPEAKER_01]: compactness and the lack of deficiency
just makes there less work for a patient
[SPEAKER_01]: to do, which is important, because a
patient is mostly trying to cultivate
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are spending their time going to the
doctor, or making sure they're taking
[SPEAKER_01]: their meds, or sleeping a lot,
or whatever they have to do for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: they need relief from, which leaves them
less time for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that they are so easy to take
care of is a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, a lot of patients that I work with
have got decreased mobility, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how is a patient going to harvest an
eight, nine, 10-foot plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult to do, and it creates
a challenge that just doesn't need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with trying to hang these types of
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The compactness of an otter flower plant
really makes it just perfect for a patient
[SPEAKER_01]: grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will just hit on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about commercial scale growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I saw commercial scale grow
was last summer when I visited Oregon CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds in Albany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen pictures of fields of cannabis
from Pakistan or Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an enthusiastic stoner, I'm like,
I would love to smell that field,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that in the old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: In India, they would get naked and run
through the plants and collect the charus
[SPEAKER_01]: on their nude skin, and then come in and
then rub it off their skin, and then start
[SPEAKER_01]: that with the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm all, sign me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's not an opportunity that
we've had.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I went to visit the Crawford
brothers down at their farm, I was all
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I'm like, the field's right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got seven acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably get covered with seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something or other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But joking aside, it was powerful
emotionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there two weeks before harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the entire aroma of their RNA,
the really nice autostrain that they do
[SPEAKER_01]: that's high in CBD, it was powerful,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know that the turf profiles of
cannabis are there to put us in a good
[SPEAKER_01]: mood, to stimulate us, to soothe our
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're standing in fields of it
and having that experience, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are definitely advantages for
commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So number one is their compact size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there is no question that there are
certain commercial growers who are going
[SPEAKER_01]: for monster plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, we're getting to be the time
where that's gonna be more about prestige
[SPEAKER_01]: and marketing and Instagram photos than it
is more about getting the most out of your
[SPEAKER_01]: acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you can do two rounds in the
same location and have the plants be
[SPEAKER_01]: compact and easier to work with,
it just increases your efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm one of the first people to go F,
efficiency, because I'm all about artisan
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also know it's unrealistic to think
that the industry is going to only be
[SPEAKER_01]: artisan growers, especially with the
wicked fast onset of hemp growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if people are gonna be doing acres
and acres and acres of hemp, if you were
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to do that with all 10 foot plants,
it would be a real pain in the ass at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are instead harvesting a whole
bunch of three footers, suddenly if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: left enough room between the rows,
you can just pull down a sled and chop and
[SPEAKER_01]: drop and chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes it very efficient and you
have repeatable results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's certainly smaller and larger
chemo bars, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like the idea of the uniformity of
the plant, but you really feel kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: disgusted philosophically by three foot
plants, so go find yourself a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds that will grow in between four and
five so that you feel like they look more
[SPEAKER_01]: like the plants that you're used to and
you'll be getting more yield off those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, generally speaking anyways,
just because they're larger size.
[SPEAKER_01]: One big advantage to using autos for
commercial is that there's almost never a
[SPEAKER_01]: need to cage or stake for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, they don't get as monstrous as
some of the trees do from regular plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also because they're crossed with
Ruderalis genetics, these are like strong
[SPEAKER_01]: Siberian Russian genetics and all the
autoflowers that I've had, even the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that were kind of crappy from folks,
they all had uniformly thick stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with the thick stalk and they're a
bit shorter and just because they exist in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world a shorter period of time,
you're not gonna get the same yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice not to have to cage them
and then uncage them as steps in your
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also nice that plants treated the
same will likely grow the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of red seeds that you can
get that while the genetics themselves may
[SPEAKER_01]: be stable, whereas they're gonna smell and
look the same, a lot of them still act
[SPEAKER_01]: differently when you actually pop the
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know at the beginning I said there
can be a lot of variability within one
[SPEAKER_01]: seed pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why this is still an evolving part
of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not here to tell you that this is a
complete system and this is down and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can just walk away from your regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm saying is, is depending on what
your needs are, especially if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp cultivator, you should really
consider autoflowers and get yourself some
[SPEAKER_01]: trial seeds and start educating yourself
because there are very good, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: very good case to be made that autoflowers
are the future of commercial cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: the large monster plants are gonna become
things that we grow for artisanal reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: and just for vanity because it's still
cool to show off pictures of a 10 foot
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also really great if you're gonna be
doing something indoors and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know how fast, how fickle the
buyers are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll come to the store and they'll say,
I would like this and they get something
[SPEAKER_01]: and they come back and the bartender says,
you want that again?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, no, it was great,
give me something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you already said you liked the first
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I'm expanding my palette.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the great things about autoflowers
is that they cycle so quickly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can be bringing new flavors onto the
market in half the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really means something,
especially if you're working with
[SPEAKER_01]: retailers who want the new new and if,
you know, we've all run into the situation
[SPEAKER_01]: where the retailer says, listen,
you can't keep product on my shelf 365.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because you can't, I'm gonna give it
to somebody else who can keep product on
[SPEAKER_01]: my shelf all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if that's the case, instead of you
doing one big run of regs and then your
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest date just gets older and older and
older, what you're doing, what you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: instead is run autoflowers and be
harvesting these things every 60 or 90
[SPEAKER_01]: days and continually be pushing new
flavors into the market and your more
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated buyers are gonna love that
because they can stay brand loyal to you
[SPEAKER_01]: and also they can be exciting their
palette and continuing in changing ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, and one other thing, commercial
growers, you know, I know a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: speakers in this room today have talked a
lot of trash about de-foliating,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, removing leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that's a worthwhile
debate to have, but people are still doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And because autoflowers tend to be a
little more open and give you a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more access, you know, not all of them,
a lot of them will still be tight,
[SPEAKER_01]: but generally speaking, they're a little
more open.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot less need to de-foliate to
get air in and to allow light to get to
[SPEAKER_01]: the lowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big thing is, is that no doubt,
one of the most attractive attributes of
[SPEAKER_01]: autoflowers are that most of the big
providers of seeds are also feminizing
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, whether or not you like
feminized seeds, that can be a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary debate and also another seed
that is coming back from a difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're talking about the people we
have so far, home growers, patient
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, and commercial scale acreage
growers, all of them love feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only folks who would really be pushing
against this are folks who are attracted
[SPEAKER_01]: to the old ways and the old school and
they want these taller seeds, or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: they just love cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about where autoflowers came
from, because we're starting to get an
[SPEAKER_01]: idea that they might be very useful in
some situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is a map of Russia, and you can
see up towards the top of Russia there,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the Arctic Ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cold there, and they get snow
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we found was that Rurals was
first identified and described in the
[SPEAKER_01]: early 1900s, and it was found along the
Volga River system in Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many say that it is its own species,
but that is also something that's up for
[SPEAKER_01]: debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly acts a lot different than
Cannabis sativa, but really the jury's
[SPEAKER_01]: still out on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original plant was, it had no little,
an insignificant amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was there, but you would smoke it and
nothing would happen, and the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile was kind of akin to dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they found was that it was super
hardy, and that was the important part.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were growing it, or it was growing
feral in really bad, rocky soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and because of where it's located in
northern Russia, it had adapted to a way
[SPEAKER_01]: of being wicked, short, potential growing
season, because it's winter most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also during the time that the plant
would be growing, depending exactly where
[SPEAKER_01]: you are in Russia, you're very likely to
have 24 hours of daylight then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so scientists are saying that chances
are that between the short opportunity for
[SPEAKER_01]: growth during the summer, and also the
inclement weather, and the poor soil
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, low nutrients, that this kind of
combination packed these auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics into a plant that was just
waiting to become raw material for
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other things that I thought was
interesting, oh I guess I already gave you
[SPEAKER_01]: the information on the slide, we'll go
through it real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Short summers, it was great for rope,
it didn't have THC, and life cycles are
[SPEAKER_01]: 60, 90, and 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually the reason why I put this
slide in here is for that photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a huge field of cannabis,
it's not autos, but it's in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we were talking about Siberian
winter, I just wanted to point out that
[SPEAKER_01]: what this picture is, is the first heavy
snow in Pakistan, in this small community,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they let the first snow lay on their
plants to make them cold, and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: will cut them this winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about how we all are making ice
water hash, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making snow hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So badass, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, it's off topic, but whatever,
it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about objections to auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like this is pretty much what I
have done for the last year since I came
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the closet as an auto flower lover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everybody has their thing they
hate about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, a lot of them, a lot of it's
pretty legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it, though, is just precious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say number one, it's not a large
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my friend, Matt Storm,
at Emerald Triangle Gold Organics in
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt, standing next to one of his
typical plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolute monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: People love this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say anybody loves this who's into
cannabis, but dudes really love this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of like monstrous, foul thing
that they created and then will then get
[SPEAKER_01]: them stoned, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of dudes push back against auto
flowers as being cute, elegant,
[SPEAKER_01]: dismissible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just need to kind of get over
that if they're going to interact with
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do they have to?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a common objection, but it only
matters if you are really kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: emotionally connected with growing a
monster plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody likes bragging rights,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, after meeting auto flowers,
I realized that I would much rather be
[SPEAKER_01]: bragging about the killer terpene profile
than the size of the plant, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: when you bring it back to the fact that I
work so much with patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it limits horizontal space,
so you need to go up, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that you have got a canopy
limitations in whatever state you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you can only get so wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you can only get so wide,
growing double the auto flower plants may
[SPEAKER_01]: not be a workable business decision for
you, even with two cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to work that out for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can go up, well, then there's
going to be a really good case for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: stick with regular seeds that are going to
be extra tall because not only do you get
[SPEAKER_01]: the width space, you get the vertical
space as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, auto flowers don't have an
answer to that, but I got to tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that that applies to is very
small and may not include you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, some people are all like,
all right, oddly shaped flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's true, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on whose seeds that you
buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of people breeding auto
seeds right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen a handful of different types
of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would say most of them look
just like you would think a regular flower
[SPEAKER_01]: would look, but some of them show more of
the ruderalis in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them will look like,
kind of like foxtailing, for those of you
[SPEAKER_01]: who know what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just kind of like come out in these
kind of like jagged foxtails.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and people look at that and
they're like, what plant is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, we have a patient on
Bashon Island who won some auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds from, well, I guess I won't say who,
and they grew them this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she sent me a picture and she said,
is this okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this smokable?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, how does it smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she says, it smells fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I think you're in good shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like dry it and go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was just that one moment of
like, is this the same cannabis that I
[SPEAKER_01]: grew up with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as the seeds develop a little bit
more in their looks and as these lines get
[SPEAKER_01]: more stable, you know, occasionally you
might run into oddly shaped flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people say, I can't breed with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's not true, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly you're gonna run into more
challenges trying to breed from a
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll tell you, man, I am, you know,
when I'm at events now, people hand me reg
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds of autos all the time now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got boys and girls and
you're willing to up your research game,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a lot of fun that you can have
breeding auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can even be doing this just as a
home grower, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of fun to have there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are saying, yeah, you can't
breed with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it means more is like, you just need
to up your game on how to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite as simple as regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've hit on this once already,
but low yield is still an issue as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's really about the seeds
that you choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do your research in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when you add together the
two cycles and that they're so much more
[SPEAKER_01]: convenient and if you find the right seeds
for you, yield may be a non-issue for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is legit that the plants are
smaller and on some of the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: the spacing between the flowers are a
little wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, know your genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a buy and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about educating yourself about your
purchase before you move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also there is still some
variability from seed to seed that we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this is a legitimate
concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not like these people are saying,
you know, auto flowers suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got low yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't breed with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're small and they taste like crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those attributes might be true about
some small subset of the seeds in each
[SPEAKER_01]: category.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anything that has got all of those is
not being sold on the market anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's not what the market
demands.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plenty of really good breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even right here in Oregon that
are selling premium seeds that will,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause you to be overjoyed
whether you are a home grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: a patient, or cultivating at mass size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, next steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that you are now titillated by
auto flowers and you want to know more.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some of the companies that I
have personally grown their gear and had
[SPEAKER_01]: great success with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD right here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mephisto is regarded by most to be,
you know, top tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero Zero Seed Bank out of Spain just
started shipping into the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: and they've got US distributors now.
[SPEAKER_01]: A new upstart that is Great Sebring Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy is a radical, pro-patient grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes his seeds and he sends them to
patients across the country for the cost
[SPEAKER_01]: of shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just badass, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the things that I like
about working with auto flower people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Green Rush has not hit the auto flower
scene as much as it hit the reg scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still a lot of people who are
really doing their growing from their,
[SPEAKER_01]: and growing and trading from their art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that's not true still in
reg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got lots of great friends who are
regs, but there's so many reg seeds being
[SPEAKER_01]: bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see what it feels like at Emerald
Cup in the seed tent, you can feel that it
[SPEAKER_01]: has changed a little bit and that's,
you don't really get that from the auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flower scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last, I wasn't able to get his logo
up, but you can be sure that when this
[SPEAKER_01]: video goes on the YouTube channel,
the logo will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mandalorian Genetics, you can find him on
Instagram too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called him and I told him, I said,
dude, I got to give you some kind of award
[SPEAKER_01]: for germination rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent a bunch of seeds for us to spread
around all of the patients on Bashon
[SPEAKER_01]: Island where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our germination rates were 100 for
100.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody else that sent seeds was 100
for 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: And think about it too, these are patients
who barely know what they're doing in many
[SPEAKER_01]: cases and they're still popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're big fans of Mandalorian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to get educated,
I am going to repeat the same forum that
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff suggested earlier today, which is
autoflowernetwork.net.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the home of auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a really cute story too because
you know, auto flower people wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in the regular cannabis
growing forums and they were ridiculed and
[SPEAKER_01]: made fun of and like, as you can imagine
in that kind of environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a few years back, they said,
all right, forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take, you know,
we're going to take our auto flowers and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to go set up our own sandbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they did and autoflower.net was
born and that is a great place to get
[SPEAKER_01]: reviews of seeds and seed companies,
learn some tricks that people have learned
[SPEAKER_01]: about growing auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, if you really want to get
Steve to do it, if you are a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: enthusiast to the nerd level, this is
where you want to go for the premium info.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, it would not be an auto
flower presentation without plugging
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff's new book that comes out on October
22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very grateful to have gotten an
advanced copy and read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a good book.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to know about this book,
besides the fact that you should buy it,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that if you're already a professional
grower, this book is going to be much
[SPEAKER_01]: below your knowledge set.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have got family and they are
sick and you've encouraged them to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: their cannabis so that they can feel
better or if they're just like bad ass
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners and they love working their
garden and they'd like to expand their
[SPEAKER_01]: garden to something new, and cool,
and easy, this book is just really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will bring anybody, even people who are
resistant to cannabis along from the very
[SPEAKER_01]: basics of cannabis and why you want to try
auto flowers and how to actually do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great book, comes out October
22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want an easy link to the
presale on Amazon, you can go to my
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram at Shaving Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a link to it if you follow my
profile link.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I've got four minutes left
and I'll take a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I'm moderating the room and I'm
the one who is running the mic,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm just going to have you yell it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hey.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question for you is about consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're looking for something that you
said that we're more familiar with,
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean like bud structure?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bud structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I noticed like the stuff that
leans more ruderalis doesn't seem to dense
[SPEAKER_03]: as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't seem to, from what I saw,
seem to grow in the same physical way that
[SPEAKER_03]: another auto flower that seems to lean
less off of the ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you try that again with different
words?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, what's the best way for us
to know if we're going to have a structure
[SPEAKER_03]: that is more like cannabis that we're
familiar with versus the ruderalis
structure?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way to do it is to trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never suggest that you commit to a
big purchase without running a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: packs yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a lot of people who auto flowers
are going to be appropriate for,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're growing for fun and for smoke
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for those people to see some
variation in the plants, that might
[SPEAKER_01]: actually be kind of cool because you're
comparing and contrasting and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are growing either at the
commercial level, either in the licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: or the unlicensed market, I would not just
jump into these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, do a run that's R and D,
buy a bunch of different packs and then
[SPEAKER_01]: just run them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, use those data points
to either say, this gives me the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: structure I want so that I've got good bag
appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this other stuff, it may smell
good and smoke good, but maybe that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go into my head stash if I have
to move the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any issues with cloning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it sounds like if you found a
really nice plant and you like the look of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you can just clone it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this stuff has already gone into
flowering stage so quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you force it to make some designated
ran?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to give you the usual answer
and then I'll tell you that I'm probably
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the usual answer is that auto flowers
cannot be cloned because the stress
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately causes them to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, that has happened every
single time because even though I got the
[SPEAKER_01]: warning, I'm a researcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I talk to my hardcore breeding
friends, they'll say, oh no, you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: this and we're trying this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm thinking that the state of the
art right now is that you may be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: clone and do some breeding magic with some
of the lines, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm only really basing that on
secondhand information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rule of thumb, though, is that auto
flowers can't be cloned because that
[SPEAKER_01]: stress causes them to flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I might be like on photo period
defense, but because I want to try out
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You and Jeff have both said, you know,
eight, six, nine months, this long period
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as for what?
[SPEAKER_04]: For the period for photo period plants to
finish in giant plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also the time the light needs to
be on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Jeff references went up to 20,
20, even 24 hours on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I don't have plant count,
I can select the right photo strain plant
[SPEAKER_04]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to plant eighty five,
six inch cubes or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strain being like 60 days or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to emphasize like photos don't
have to go or they don't have to be giant.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a learning curve there or like
the Dutch table method.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's called where you can grow a
whole bunch of photos, really squat and
[SPEAKER_04]: still have some attributes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a learning curve there,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess it's just you guys are both
preaching pretty hard on photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have to be huge outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost impossible to fully control
unless you really know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you said auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean you mean regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get your I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regs are great, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also wasn't a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I'm making the case for auto
flowers, I'm going to use the worst case
[SPEAKER_01]: available for the regs.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so, you know, there are certainly I
mean, hell, even you could if you wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep your regs small, you can do what I
have to do in my my smaller outdoor hoops
[SPEAKER_01]: was just like top them several times
during the year so that the flowers don't
[SPEAKER_01]: end up getting wet from condensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, there's ways that you
can manage your regs so that some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: downsides that Jeff and I were both
talking about don't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but, you know, in general,
this was less a comparison of regs to auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flower in every situation and more like
frickin try out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I've run out of time and I've got
one more thing to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so not for commercial folks in the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are a patient, if you identify
as a patient and you grow for yourself for
[SPEAKER_01]: your own health, stop by and see me
because Mandalorian, Sebring Seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain Rock Farm from California all
gave me some packs to give away to
[SPEAKER_01]: authentic patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a company, go buy your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're a patient, I've got some to
give away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to show your friends this,
you can find it on the Shaving Fire
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube channel next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Shango Rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
