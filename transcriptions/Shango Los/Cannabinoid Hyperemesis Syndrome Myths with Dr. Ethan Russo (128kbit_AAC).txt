[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there, friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shango Lowes from Shaping Fire,
and I am here again with Dr. Ethan Russo,
[SPEAKER_01]: good friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are going to be talking about
cannabis hyperemesis syndrome today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are new to CHS, I encourage you
to listen to Shaping Fire episode 80,
[SPEAKER_01]: where Dr. Russo and I talk about cannabis
hyperemesis syndrome in detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today we are talking about CHS
specifically to talk about Dr. Russo's new
[SPEAKER_01]: paper on the topic, debunking some of the
myths that are being circulated about CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the recent article we are discussing
today is called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis
[SPEAKER_01]: Syndrome, Genetic Successibility to Toxic
Exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ethan, thank you for being here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This new paper is very necessary to clear
the air about what many people think the
[SPEAKER_01]: causes are to CHS, and very freely share
their opinions online about what causes
[SPEAKER_01]: CHS, but are not keeping up with the
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your review paper's goal, as far as I
understand it, is to help clear up those
[SPEAKER_01]: understandings so as we move forward,
both those of us who are cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: enthusiasts and are susceptible to having
CHS, but also all of us who speak online
[SPEAKER_01]: and to conferences so that we understand
the state of the science and we can be
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading appropriate information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that for many people who are
seeing this, they may be new to CHS as an
[SPEAKER_01]: ailment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while people can find out all about it
in detail on Shaping Fire episode 80,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you please just summarize for us
what CHS is to bring everybody up to
[SPEAKER_01]: speed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, thanks, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome,
or CHS, was first described 20 years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2004 in Australia in eight patients who
presented, unbeknownst to each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a similar set of signs and symptoms,
which consisted of nausea, vomiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: abdominal pain, and an unusual
manifestation that they would spend hours
[SPEAKER_00]: at times taking hot showers or baths to
reduce symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these were chronic users of
high THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was 20 years ago, but the
description really hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This syndrome has become more prevalent,
it seems, some by virtue of recognition of
[SPEAKER_00]: the syndrome, but also associated with the
higher potency cannabis and particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates that have become more
generally available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It remains the case that this is far more
prevalent in the US and Canada where there
[SPEAKER_00]: is access to such materials as compared to
the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are seeing an increased amount of
CHS prevalence in people because the
[SPEAKER_01]: potency of the products that we have are
increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about, to some degree,
higher THC flower, but really what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about is oil concentrates and
dabbing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our survey published a couple of years
ago, the average intake was four grams a
[SPEAKER_00]: day of high THC material among CHS
sufferers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we spoke during Shaping Fire
episode 80, you were very clear that in
[SPEAKER_01]: the early days we did not know what the
cause was, which caused science to happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you came on the show to talk about
what was not the cause and what you had
[SPEAKER_01]: found was the cause or the pathway to the
cause, which gave us a better idea of what
[SPEAKER_01]: we were dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm gonna ask you in a moment to go
through the list with me of the various
[SPEAKER_01]: things that you debunk in your new paper
that are not the cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you were very clear on episode 80 that
we do know what the genetic mutations are
[SPEAKER_01]: in a human that makes them susceptible to
CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's cement that in right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you describe the genetic mutations
that are at the root of CHS?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was apparent to me over time that
there was a small minority of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: users that seemed susceptible to CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were distinct from a lot of
people we know that used high amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis but had never had similar
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was the difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, as we'll discuss, people had
implicated things like pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: the symptoms didn't match, and I felt that
the cause of the susceptibility to CHS
[SPEAKER_00]: must be genetic, explaining why some
people got it and some people did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really started there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know for most folks, hearing you
talk about the alleles will not be
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that anyone understands,
but there are certainly people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: listening and watching who are,
you know, legit scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those folks in the audience,
would you go through and hit where the
[SPEAKER_01]: mutations are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first candidate was the gene that
encodes the CB1 receptor, cannabinoid 1
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor, where THC works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our endocannabinoids, the cannabinoids
within our body work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't see a mutation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be important later,
I think, when we discuss distinctions from
[SPEAKER_00]: other syndromes that are mistaken for CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our other two hypotheses were that this
had something to do with the enzymes that
[SPEAKER_00]: break down THC in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, something called CYP2C9.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did see statistically significant
difference that this gene or mutation on a
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, what's called a SNP, or single
nucleotide polymorphism, was present
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically significantly more in people
with CHS as opposed to our control group,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was people who used high volumes of
cannabis, again, averaging four grams a
[SPEAKER_00]: day, but did not have CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did see a mutation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third hypothesis, which also proved
true, was a mutation on what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: TRPV1.
[SPEAKER_00]: TRPV1 is a receptor that has to do with
pain and is triggered by heat and ethanol,
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise known as alcohol, and acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this mutation helped explain why the
heat or capsaicin, the chili pepper
[SPEAKER_00]: extract on the skin, temporarily reduces
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found two mutations on genes affecting
dopamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dopamine is a very important
neurotransmitter in the brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and problems with it are associated with
addiction, as well as psychosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenia, and a whole host of other
psychiatric problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having two genes that were statistically
significantly present in the CHS group as
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the high volume cannabis users
that didn't have CHS, again, indicated
[SPEAKER_00]: something important at the root of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that a drug that blocks
dopamine, haloperidol, is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that is used in emergency rooms to
try to stop the nausea and vomiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas more common drugs to treat nausea
and vomiting don't work in this syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, there was a mutation on a gene
called ABCA1 that has to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: cholesterol metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really unexpected, but it has some
important implications in that mutations
[SPEAKER_00]: there make these people susceptible to
Alzheimer disease, coronary artery
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, and diabetes mellitus later in
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason why we're here is to remove
some of the untrue information that's
[SPEAKER_01]: being spread around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the impetus for Dr. Russo publishing
this article is very specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you please explain to us what
happened to cause you to go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: effort to put out the paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm afraid we're dealing with a
post-truth world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're science is being ignored or
challenged.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kept hearing that, well,
it must be this or it must be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are really devoted to try and
disprove the fact that CHS occurs due to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis usage or synthetic cannabinoids
that hit the same CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So among these misconceptions,
have been pesticide exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I am the first one to say that
pesticides and cannabis is a huge problem
[SPEAKER_00]: where there isn't sufficient screening
testing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I published on this in 2016 to show the
rampant contamination that was present in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Washington state legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact is, as bad as those chemicals
are, and as many problems as they can
[SPEAKER_00]: create over time, the symptoms that they
produce don't match CHS at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are very often online saying,
it's got to be pesticides or this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide or Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody's got an anecdotal
story of how it happened to their uncle,
[SPEAKER_01]: cousin, trimmer, whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But these individual stories do not add up
to science because you have looked at a
[SPEAKER_01]: larger pool of both data and people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we've had people who've
documented that the cannabis they use was
[SPEAKER_00]: from a home grow with no pesticide use at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just doesn't fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, we're dealing with a
lot of wishful thinking here in relation
[SPEAKER_00]: to this diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another category that is common to
blame for CHS is neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of talk about, oh,
people use neem and this is what happens
[SPEAKER_01]: when you smoke cannabis that has been
treated with neem or worse so when you
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate it into an oil and then dab
oil with neem in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does the science say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it really doesn't fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take this one personally because
I've used neem in my organic gardening for
[SPEAKER_00]: many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I admit I have eaten berries the same
day I've sprayed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No repercussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's only an anecdote.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth is that neem is considered a
safe organic pesticide for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I scoured the literature on toxicities
associated with neem oil and it's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: its active ingredients called
azadirachtin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we've got a situation where the
symptoms don't fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been rare cases of toxicity,
one associated with a suicide attempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got a mismatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, azadirachtin has an
extremely high boiling point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's questionable that you would even
recruit it out of cannabis by smoking even
[SPEAKER_00]: though the lit tip of a cannabis joint is
in the hundreds of degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is a situation that once
again can't explain the syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, wishful thinking too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we wish we could just point to,
ah, it is this chemical and let's just
[SPEAKER_01]: remove that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's far more complex because the
precursors are actually our genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: makeup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, neem is typically used
pre-flowering as the cannabis plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dissipates entirely in three to four
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think if you did analyses for
azadirachtin or neem on flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd rarely find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the concentrations couldn't possibly
explain the few cases of toxicity that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been observed, mostly in people who
drank some significant amount of neem or
[SPEAKER_00]: azadirachtin fluid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if somebody was ill-advised and
they used neem in the seventh week of
[SPEAKER_01]: flower or something, while that is not
going to be a necessarily good experience
[SPEAKER_01]: for the cannabis enthusiast, the diagnoses
for CHS are so spread out with so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different sources that we know that a very
rare opportunity like that is not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, again, statistics would not explain
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another potential or rumored cause for CHS
that you debunk in the paper is
[SPEAKER_01]: hoplatinviroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so would you go through that analysis
too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a viroid is sort of a primitive virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been rampant in the
cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does stunt the growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can limit its potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only has there never been a case of
hoplatinviroid showed in a human,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are no cases of any plant virus or
viroid affecting humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sufficiently different from plants,
fellow living creatures, but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficiently different that there's no
likelihood that any infectious agent of
[SPEAKER_00]: this type could affect a human,
let alone with CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we get to the big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll come at this a couple different
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is that as the definition of
cannabis hyperaminosis syndrome evolved,
[SPEAKER_01]: some were wondering if it was cyclic
vomiting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then recently we have run into that a
significant scientific journal grouped
[SPEAKER_01]: them together, which got your dander up
and you wanted to clarify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like you to do both at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you address what cyclic vomiting is,
how it is not CHS, and the error that's
[SPEAKER_01]: made in the scientific journal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was in the journal of
gastroenterology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said basically that CHS was a
subset of cyclic vomiting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took on bridge at this because CVS,
cyclic vomiting syndrome, is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm very familiar with as a
neurologist, particularly as a pediatric
[SPEAKER_00]: neurologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CVS, cyclic vomiting syndrome,
typically presents in a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a teenager who has episodic nausea and
vomiting without other explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might get an advanced workup,
invasive studies, scans, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what's known as a form frust,
frustrated form of migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The natural history of cyclic vomiting
syndrome is this is a child or teenager
[SPEAKER_00]: who has a family history of migraine,
typically their mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get symptoms of nausea and
vomiting without a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as they get older, the migraine with
the headache will establish itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, cyclic vomiting syndrome,
like many forms of migraine, is very
[SPEAKER_00]: amenable to treatment with cannabis,
whether it be acutely or as a preventive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see how this has created
confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm quite critical in that people
with nausea and vomiting typically end up
[SPEAKER_00]: in emergency departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless the doctor is willing to spend
the time to really ask the right
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, it's simple to have this
confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, can we really tell the
difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in fact, there is the mutation on
the CB1 gene, CNR1.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a mutation in the cyclic vomiting
syndrome that we did not find in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the capability of
distinguishing these based on laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to finish up talking about the
various cannabinoids and their role in
[SPEAKER_01]: CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to hit this, I want to
summarize what you just said very clearly,
[SPEAKER_01]: that while we are still researching CHS,
we have got enough science done at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point that we understand that CHS is not
caused by pesticides, it's not caused by
[SPEAKER_01]: neem, and it's not a CVS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we know is that to develop CHS,
you must have the pre-existing gene
[SPEAKER_01]: mutations, and then you need to imbibe a
whole lot of cannabis, generally speaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: upwards of four grams of concentrate a
day, generally speaking, with each person
[SPEAKER_01]: having some variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have the summary right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody might have a different threshold
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should also point out that anybody who
suddenly has exposure to too high a dose
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC may get sick and vomit,
but that's very different from having this
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic, cyclic situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really are able to distinguish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require actually talking to
patients in detail, which is really not
[SPEAKER_00]: the model of current medicine in this
country, I'm afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to talk about how you finished
the paper, which I found very interesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: because as somebody who is in cannabis
media, I get reached out to by people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are experiencing CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by definition, they're a cannabis
enthusiast, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using a lot of cannabis every day,
which is how that, in cooperation with
[SPEAKER_01]: their gene mutations, causes these
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people say, oh, I'm going to try to
switch to just doing CBD, or I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: switch to just CBG, or for this particular
autoimmune, I'm going to try just THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your paper goes through each of the
popular cannabinoids that patients have
[SPEAKER_01]: tried to shift through, kind of denying
the doom scenario of actually not being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to use cannabis anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have research that talks about
why trying to shift to another cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: is not really going to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you delineate that?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we've implicated herbal cannabis
and THC in triggering CHS symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it will occur with any drug or
cannabinoid that stimulates the CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would include synthetic Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would include cannabinol, CBN,
it might involve CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem there is twofold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, it's extremely hard to have a
CBD preparation that isn't going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: some amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two is that CBD over time may increase
anandamide levels, and this possibly also
[SPEAKER_00]: is a trigger to CHS symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the levels are too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, we've done a lot of work on
published on cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a wonderful agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not stimulate the CB1 receptor
with any particular potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: On its own, it's not an anti-immunetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not one that's usually used for
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's likely could be helpful in reducing
anxiety with the syndrome and possibly the
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, but I doubt it would be an effective
preventive on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are CBG only plants and preparations
that are available in contrast to CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: which unless it was developed from an
isolate is unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the acid cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is anti-immunetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps reduce vomiting, but the problem
is it's not stable and it's breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: product is THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one sees the pitfall there potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about CBDA cannabidiolic acid?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is CBD before it's decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In animals that has a strong
anti-immunetic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have enough information from
anybody who's tried this to know whether
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA on its own might be helpful in this
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the only effective treatment
that will work in the long-term is
[SPEAKER_00]: abstinence from cannabis or other agents
that stimulate CB1, and that includes
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic cannabinoids because it's well
established in people that aren't using
[SPEAKER_00]: herbal cannabis, but have had CHS in
relation to the synthetic agents that
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulate the CB1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's look forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have been right on the front lines
of cannabis hyper-MS syndrome for the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole 20 years that we've been looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have been following the research from
the early days when it was first defined
[SPEAKER_01]: and described.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have participated in most of the early
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today you have spent efforts through this
paper debunking the things that it is not
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we have a better grasp of what CHS
is both so that we can research it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have good information going
throughout the cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious to know where you would like
to see research happen next to further our
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of CHS and hopefully relieve
the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cannabis enthusiasts that are
developing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have plans now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to, we're involved in putting
together a consortium of researchers to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to the National Institutes of Health
for a grant to study CHS in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to have hundreds of patients
who undergo the genomic testing to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the five gene candidates that we've
identified and possibly others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we'd like to do metabolomic
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would involve a sample of saliva
that's analyzed for its chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: composition to see if a CHS attack
produces biochemical changes that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: identify as markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we need much better
investigation of the psychiatric
[SPEAKER_00]: accompaniments to CHS, which we've
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tendency towards addiction,
mood disorders, anxiety, depression,
[SPEAKER_00]: and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the idea of the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this instance, we need a grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not confident that there's going to be
great funding opportunities in biomedical
[SPEAKER_00]: research at a federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people who are interested to know
more about CHS or want to get involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: clearly they're shaping fire episode 80,
where you can get the in-depth look at
[SPEAKER_01]: CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what if people want to get involved
financially in supporting their work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would they contact your company,
Credo Science, that way if they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get involved with funding?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, the three papers that we've
published on cannabinoid hyperemesis
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome are available free.
[SPEAKER_00]: No copyright problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my personal website at ethanruso
.org at the library tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the search engine, if you put
hyperemesis, H-Y-P-E-R-E-M-E-S-I-S.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will also be links at the bottom of
this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: WhatisCHS?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what-is-CHS.com that has a resource
page with links to the articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, more information at a nice level
that I think is easy to understand and
[SPEAKER_00]: access to the CHS screening test that is
available commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Dr. Russo, thank you so much for
sharing your time with us and your life's
[SPEAKER_01]: research as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you also for a lot of people
think of ivory tower science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes scientists don't get
involved with the nitty gritty of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you are part and parcel of the
