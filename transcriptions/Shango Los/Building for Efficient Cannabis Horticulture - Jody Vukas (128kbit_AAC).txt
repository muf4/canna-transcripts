[SPEAKER_03]: This presentation from Jody Voukas is from
Smart Grow Pots, and it's entitled
[SPEAKER_03]: Designing the Future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jody has been on the forefront of highly
efficient state-of-the-art cannabis grow
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities for the last eight years.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has designed, built, and retrofitted
well over a million square feet for some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the biggest licensed producers in the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today he'll be talking about designing the
future of cannabis horticulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give it up for Jody Voukas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had someone hoot and holler
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Portland Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Jody Voukas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart Grow Pros is a company that I put
together a few years back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing design builds since about
2009, 2010.
[SPEAKER_02]: We specialize in anything from greenfield
projects, which basically means moving
[SPEAKER_02]: earth building new structures,
or retrofits, which is about 80% or 90% of
[SPEAKER_02]: the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Efficiency is our main focus when we're
designing and building green grow
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Designing the future is pretty much
basically kind of encompasses all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The key to success in this industry is
design built.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything revolves around a grow
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dispensaries, extraction facilities,
all these things rely on a grow facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't keep in mind and take
notes and build a highly efficient grow
[SPEAKER_02]: facility and a market that's extremely
volatile these days, you're gonna be out
[SPEAKER_02]: of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's happening in states that have
been online for five, six years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even newer states that are coming
online, the price volatility is real,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's affecting businesses and people
that are shutting down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of opportunities when it
comes to doing these facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: High capex is very costly to build these
things, especially if you're gonna build
[SPEAKER_02]: it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always an idea that, hey,
we'll build it right now and try to be as
[SPEAKER_02]: cheap as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheap is not a word that you can use in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mentality is we'll build it,
we'll get and start turning revenue,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll take some of that money,
and then we'll go ahead and we'll modify
[SPEAKER_02]: or retrofit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't happen, it just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of investors that come into the
space or guys that are trying to start off
[SPEAKER_02]: with low capital, if you have one major
failure, you're out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, number two, if your cost of
goods are too high, you're gonna be out of
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that kind of mentality,
I've seen it since 2008, 2009,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll do it as cheap as possible,
we'll make that money and we'll put it
[SPEAKER_02]: back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't happen, it just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cost of goods, it goes in line with your
capex.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta be able to manufacture a low
cost of good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're not, if you're growing at
800, 900, $1,000 pounds, you're filing
[SPEAKER_02]: bankruptcy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prime example, in this state right now,
65% is a hard number of licensees that
[SPEAKER_02]: have not applied for renewal next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: 65% of recreational licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the market dropped down to high
end, $1,100 or $1,200 for high end or
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses are seeing maybe 600 or 700.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some exceptions,
but we're talking 80% of the market that's
[SPEAKER_02]: growing all the same product and growing
mediocre stuff because they don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: facility set up right, but it's costing
them a lot of money out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing the same thing in Colorado,
same exact scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: Value engineering, VE, great word to use
because you have to be aware of where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're spending money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get a little more into the value
engineering aspect, but there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: component there that you need to pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because something costs more than
anything else doesn't mean you should buy
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of my favorite sayings is
just because it's on sale doesn't mean you
[SPEAKER_02]: should buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same kind of deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can spend money smart and buy high end
equipment without spending top dollar for
[SPEAKER_02]: it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big one too, successful
methodology for commercial space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot of different ways
to grow these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some work better than others, but when
you're into commercial space, you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: be very aware of costs and how you can do
it effectively and cost effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll push a little bit more into that as
we move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market volatility, I touched briefly
on that, but I think we're going to see a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of movement from a federal aspect
sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of initiatives that are
happening, especially now that our current
[SPEAKER_02]: administration is on board with pushing
things more into a regulatory environment
[SPEAKER_02]: and decriminalizing, rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see that door swing even
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: More vastly as states are allowed to
transport product back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've seen what California can do
specifically from a black market
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in one year, it could drive the
price down hundreds of dollars from black
[SPEAKER_02]: market product moving across the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine when that goes federal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a massive blow for a lot
of businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first step of all of this to build
efficiency, which is my favorite word in
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry, floor plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Floor plans are the baseline of
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Workflow needs to be kept in mind and it
needs to be very tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Labor is going to be your most expensive
cost in these facilities and minimizing
[SPEAKER_02]: links of walks and paths, keeping
employees in a tight circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, 15 cents here,
a dollar here, all these things are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to affect your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to affect your cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bench and lighting layouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are vendors, there are companies
that can help you lay the stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to build benches on your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what ends up happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen time and time again wooden
benches are being built because they try
[SPEAKER_02]: to save some money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they're failing all their tests
because there's mold and mildew that's
[SPEAKER_02]: growing on the wood that's being absorbed
from water on the floor and those spores
[SPEAKER_02]: are flying up and landing on the plants
and they're failing tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spend the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fertigation management, very important as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of opportunities there to
control your recipes, control nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: cause, water cause, and eliminate human
error.
[SPEAKER_02]: Human errors in this industry can be
detrimental to crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen whole crops or multiple rooms
get burned up because people are mixing
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients by hand and a hundred thousand
square foot facility and hand watering and
[SPEAKER_02]: then suddenly you're out millions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mechanical systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big one and we're going to drill
down into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mechanical systems is everything next to
lighting in your building.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're not spending some time and
making sure that you're going through some
[SPEAKER_02]: proper designs or even entertaining some
of the stuff that's out there to be highly
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient, your electrical costs are just
going to crush you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last but not least, a part of the
efficiency equation, environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: controls.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't put a thermostat on a wall and a
grove room and expect you to maintain
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures and humidity controls that
can't be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will never happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So floor plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the big factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulatory and compliance is a big
challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to think about stuff with
security, cameras, decontamination
[SPEAKER_02]: protocols, which that's one of the big
ones that actually gets left out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have dirty come into the
building and clean go into the grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: This way here you can actually handle
control pressures depending on where your
[SPEAKER_02]: building is at or if you're in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: A greenhouse is very challenging depending
on the demographic location.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in this state alone, I've worked on
some stuff down south and with all the
[SPEAKER_02]: non-organic wineries and vineyards going
on, there's overspray, there's bugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's powder mildew, there's botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So decontamination is a big one and if you
handle it on the front end, you'll get
[SPEAKER_02]: through your compliance and you will pass
your tests and you won't be battling bugs
[SPEAKER_02]: and have to have some crazy IPM in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maximizing your grow space is going to
kind of go back to your benches.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have 100,000 square foot facility,
you should be able to maximize that space
[SPEAKER_02]: and utilize about 80% of that or 70% of
that for canopy space, for growing
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of ways to achieve that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked briefly about workflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't emphasize workflow enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a lot of facilities where people
are walking down hallways that are 80 foot
[SPEAKER_02]: long when the floor plan could cut that in
half and you can get into a flower room by
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting your distance in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, two minutes here, three minutes
there, four minutes here, spin to people
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of wandering around,
it affects your labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can't grow a four or $500 pound
indoor, you're in for a world of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what we've already seen,
like I've expressed, high in the market
[SPEAKER_02]: for wholesale, we're seeing $900 for large
volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I'm talking 200 pounds or 300
pound sales here and there, that doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: leave you a lot of room if you're growing
an $800 pound outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Equipment locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: This really pertains to mechanical systems
and electrical.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are things that be kept in mind when
you're designing the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know where all your
infrastructure is coming in the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to have short runs as
possible because copper is very expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even aluminum wiring is expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a lot of labor intensive kind
of stuff, especially from a high voltage
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shorter runs is going to cut down your
installation costs as well as mechanical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water chilling systems, which we'll get
into a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minimizing the distance of travel is going
to be key because you can save tens of
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of dollars and maybe even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're setting up your facility
properly and putting mechanical systems,
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical rooms in the right location.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things equate to running a low
cost of good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Years back when I started doing this,
I saw what was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was helping some friends set up their
facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I built a 100 light grow back in 2009,
which back in 2009, that was a very large
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I laid the whole thing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drew it out, laid it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I handed it off to engineering and
architects and they were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: who are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never seen anything like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually they're having to coach people
along.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I started building more facilities and
getting some different situations,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always trying to figure out how can
I make things more efficient and how can
[SPEAKER_02]: we make more money?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have a $700 pound cost of good in
this facility, well the next one,
[SPEAKER_02]: how can I get it to 550 or 600?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I get it below 500?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the end of the day,
I saw the writing on the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people coming from the black
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go back 10 years and you look at
what the prices are now in comparison,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are 60 to 70 percent less in the
black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the way from New York, California,
the numbers dropped tremendously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cost of goods are very important,
which is all based on the efficiency of
[SPEAKER_02]: your facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Benching.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little costly on the front end.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of options in the market,
but it is a long term investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a long play.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a marathon.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a sprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're into it, just try to make a
quick buck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might as well stop now because there
is no such thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of money you're going to spend
on the front ends and the amount of money
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to try to get your ROI by the
time that two years or three years rolls
[SPEAKER_02]: around, price is going to fluctuate and
you could be out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to think from an investment
opportunity and that mindset, not just
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from a grower's mind, come from a
business mindset as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a smart investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things will last for decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spend a few extra bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking $11 a square foot on
average, $10 a square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will last you a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of controversy around the
single level versus vertical growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've worked on a couple vertical grows
and they're very challenging when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: to a flowering aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a mechanical and environmental
perception, you have two levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and humidity to deal with and
heat rises naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the grows that I've gone into that
are vertical already, the top layer always
[SPEAKER_02]: does very well because the temperature is
right and the humidity is right and then
[SPEAKER_02]: the lower level suffers because the
humidity falls and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have two different grades of
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone thinks if I go vertical,
I increase my space as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not 100% true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get a little bit more
space, but then you're going to run static
[SPEAKER_02]: benches and you have to have aisle ways in
between that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you really gaining that much more
grow space?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a minimum of three foot
or three and a half foot based on fire
[SPEAKER_02]: code.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you gaining at your space?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you run into all the environmental
challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying it can't be done,
but it has to be well planned and well
[SPEAKER_02]: thought out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of new options in the market
too with actual two tier rolling benches
[SPEAKER_02]: that can help increase that canopy space,
but from a mechanical perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canopy management is very important and
air movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things play hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all comes back to environment controls
and mechanical systems being set up
[SPEAKER_02]: properly and making sure that you can move
air, you can dehumidify and you can cool
[SPEAKER_02]: as much as you need it and be able to move
that air through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canopy management, there's a lot of guys
growing really tall plants and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: shaving off or skirting three or four foot
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't really make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me as a grower, I would rather grow
shorter plants and control my canopy and
[SPEAKER_02]: have a three foot plant and that way their
light penetration can get down,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we can also get air through there
instead of trying to pull air up through
[SPEAKER_02]: this deep, dense canopy of plants that are
six or seven feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the same performance out of a
shorter plant and you have shorter cycles
[SPEAKER_02]: as well because you don't have to veg as
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole different subject,
but canopy management, air movements,
[SPEAKER_02]: very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lighting design, there's a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of companies in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Educate yourselves, talk to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's reps that will give you
information and don't take everything as
[SPEAKER_02]: gospel, but listen, take some notes and
then do some comparisons yourself and then
[SPEAKER_02]: make your own decision or talk to some
guys that are using these fixtures,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's a lot of options in the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them work better than others and
this kind of falls into play with don't
[SPEAKER_02]: buy just because it costs more because it
necessarily is not going to get you more
[SPEAKER_02]: performance out of your lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technology hasn't really changed a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: High pressure sodium still dominates the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: CMH has made some advances and could be
used in certain applications, but HBS is
[SPEAKER_02]: still seems to be the dominant source.
[SPEAKER_02]: LEDs have made some progress, but as far
as performance and cost associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: the capital expense, it's very costly for
LEDs and I myself like to stick with
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I know is working day in
and day out versus running with an LED
[SPEAKER_02]: that they have their challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's one thing that a lot of people
don't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a doping effect because there's
certain color spectrums that they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve, so they take a phosphorus,
they coat it with the actual diodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they heat up, then it manipulates the
color spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, phosphorus has a shelf
life of 45 days, a half life, so at some
[SPEAKER_02]: point in time it's going to degrade and
when it does degrade, you don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, from a veggie perspective,
we don't see it being affecting the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a vertical rag and veg,
LEDs seem to work great, but from a
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering perspective, you know,
a year, year and a half, two years,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have to have a
spectrometer and you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: take measurements at certain periods of
time to ensure that your color spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: has not fallen off because if you don't,
you lose 3% across your canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of money, especially if you
have 20,000, even 10,000 square foot of
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of money that's going to be
lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: PPFD methodologies, you know, know what
numbers you need and what those numbers
[SPEAKER_02]: mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, 900 PPFD or 1,000, 1,100,
you know, these matters, the numbers
[SPEAKER_02]: matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what you're working with and if
you're going to run higher PPFDs,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is something that I like to do,
it comes with challenges, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: more nutrient, more feeding, you know,
you have to have a more robust mechanical
[SPEAKER_02]: system, but in the offset, you don't have
to run your electrical as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're running nine and a half to
10 hours in a flower, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and over the course of the day,
that's a big cost savings because you can
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule your timing in between peak hours
and the off peak hours, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're saving yourself money because there
is an actual thing of photo, actual photon
[SPEAKER_02]: saturation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants will get to a point where they've
had enough and they're going to shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a paper that was issued by
Purdue where they talked about over
[SPEAKER_02]: saturation and what they discovered that
it affected a plant so negatively that it
[SPEAKER_02]: would detrimentally shut down the
photosynthetic engine of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're crushing your plants for 12
hours at a high PPFD, more than likely
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get stress, which is going
to cause lack of yields, lack of quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphrodite, I mean, all kinds of
problems can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mechanical systems have, I mean,
very, very, very, very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can never have too much cooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, your mechanical system is going
to cover cooling, demitification.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have redundancy in your
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you set up a system properly,
you should never have to turn off a light
[SPEAKER_02]: if an HVAC unit goes down or if a water
chiller goes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're turning off lights because you
don't have enough cooling or your systems
[SPEAKER_02]: are failing and you don't have backup,
I mean, you kind of lost the race too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the systems that we design and
build, we use a lot of options with
[SPEAKER_02]: natural gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do heat recapture on a heat exchanger
that we pump back into the hydronic
[SPEAKER_02]: system, which is part of dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're highly efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cost about 25% more on the front end,
30%, but your ROI is going to happen a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole lot faster because we've seen
savings anywhere from 10, $15,000 a month
[SPEAKER_02]: up to 30, $40,000 a month in electrical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, that's a lot of
money in 12 months and that will affect
[SPEAKER_02]: your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it helps, you know, going with these
natural gas options, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've seen on the exchange rate anywhere
from Denver, for example, is 12 to 13
[SPEAKER_02]: cents a kilowatt hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, once you throw in demand charges,
you know, here's another thing people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You throw in a bunch of lights,
there's a demand charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the electric company is going to hit
you for, and it's going to tax you for 15
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes in increments.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so you don't see that in your
initial billing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you actually have to take a class
to understand an electrical bill,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they find ways to hit you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And next thing you know, you're paying an
extra $4,000, $5,000 a month because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're turning all your lights on at one
every single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to find ways to offset that and
find ways to slowly ramp up lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, use natural gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're paying 13 cents a kilowatt
hour, even for an air-cooled water
[SPEAKER_02]: chiller, on a gas exchange, it's about two
cents, three cents for a natural gas water
[SPEAKER_02]: chiller.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these things, again, add up and they
add up quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also developed a system too where not
only were we capturing heat and using that
[SPEAKER_02]: for power, we're also capturing the
exhaust and cleaning and treating it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the byproduct of exhausted CO2,
makes up about 60% of exhaust,
[SPEAKER_02]: 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So suddenly you pay the same amount for
the setup if you're going to use liquid
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2, but then you have no additional cost
because it's a byproduct from the water
[SPEAKER_02]: chills themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from day one, you pay a setup cost
after that for the next five, seven,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 years, you get free CO2 coming off your
water chilling system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vertigation management.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seminar before me, Sarah was talking
about RO systems and I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: things get lost in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't realize how important water
is with nutrient delivery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using just the carbon filter is not going
to cut it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot of minerals that
are in your city water, especially even
[SPEAKER_02]: well water, that can be very damaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a plant can't uptake those minerals
that are in your city water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does that end up doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: It ends up causing problems with plant
performance because then it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually slow down your uptake because the
plant doesn't know what to do with the
[SPEAKER_02]: minerals that are put in front of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: With RO water, day in, day out,
you know, exactly what you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's clean water and your nutrient
programs will also be highly effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the recapture side, we also use another
RO system where we can capture the
[SPEAKER_02]: condensation as well as leachate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, leachate you're generally going
to see 10 to 50% runoff on average,
[SPEAKER_02]: but condensation you're going to see 40%
or 45% of water coming back to
[SPEAKER_02]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're pumping 10,000 gallons a day
through your nutrient, and through your
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation, you're going to see at least
4,000 gallons coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are just dumping that
straight out into the sewer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not grab that water?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get about an 80% rejection rate on
that, which means you'll get 80% of 4,000
[SPEAKER_02]: gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get 3,200 gallons of
reusable, 100% clean water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why wouldn't you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there are going to be
regulations on stuff that's being dumped
[SPEAKER_02]: down the drains.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of work with canopy growth in
Canada, in Aurora, and there are already
[SPEAKER_02]: on, you know, super vigilant about what's
going down the sewer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're already having to put
protocols in place to eliminate what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're putting down or minimizing the
amount of PPMs that are going down the
[SPEAKER_02]: drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to happen here, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, don't be fooled.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as well as we had a conversation
outside about lighting and FCC
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if a fixture cannot pass FCC
regulations, you're going to see a problem
[SPEAKER_02]: with that eventually because there's a lot
of frequencies that are being shot out
[SPEAKER_02]: into the atmosphere coming from these
lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't run with some fixtures
that are regulated or that are listed
[SPEAKER_02]: under the FCC, eventually we're going to
see some challenges with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The automation, the thing I love about
fertigation management is removing human
[SPEAKER_02]: error is the big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second thing is it allows you to tweak
recipes to a specific cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some OGs are very particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some sativas are very particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Golden Goat is one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't feed that plant very high EC
values.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just, she won't take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with these systems, they're all
computer controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can capture your nutrient programs,
plug them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll never be, they'll never change
unless you change them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can take test results,
take that data, and then cross reference
[SPEAKER_02]: it and make adjustments where you can
figure out where you can dial in plants
[SPEAKER_02]: for specific campanoids, profiles,
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot more than just
feeding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot more than just feeding
nutrients to your plants and to your
[SPEAKER_02]: benches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other great thing is it also
minimizes costs of nutrients and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we do water delivery into rock
wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only doing about a liter a day for
feedings.
[SPEAKER_02]: A liter a day versus if you run a three
gallon plant with cocoa per light mix or
[SPEAKER_02]: peat moss, you know, you're looking at a
gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So multiply that across 14,000 plants or
20 or 100,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It adds up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and everyone knows nutrients in a
liquid form.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not super expensive, but on that
level, it's very costly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unless you know what you're doing
with, you know, with powders, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a whole different ball game.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole different ball game if you're
going to try to mix powders on your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Environmental controls, last but not
least.
[SPEAKER_02]: The great thing about environmental
controls is once you set it, it's going to
run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day you want to set, you want 42%
RH.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's going to give you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to give you a 1% swing plus
or minus all dependent on your mechanical
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want your temperature at 82%,
that's what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want 78% in your mother room,
that's what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they are a little costly on the
front end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you're able to dial everything
in and every single day you're able to
[SPEAKER_02]: control the environment, which is one of
the most important things next to the plan
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: These systems will also, such as Preva,
will capture data for you as well to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you how much power you're using that day,
what the peak load is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever have an issue down the road
with a crop, you know what, and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: down 20%, you can go back and access all
your data.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go back into your irrigation
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go into your environmental
controls and you can determine what
[SPEAKER_02]: happened, what happened here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if something goes sideways,
which is also great, you get text
[SPEAKER_02]: messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's alarms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's never a moment that something
goes sideways on you that you don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: because the system is there monitoring it
all for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best part is you keep everyone's
hands out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no one's going to play in with things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can control your controls
and you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these things matter into the
portion of labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, 30,000, 40,000 square foot
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we set one up in Florida,
40,000, and they're running in staff of
[SPEAKER_02]: 17, 18 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That includes the harvesting team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's all these systems in place
that minimize having to have 40 bodies to
[SPEAKER_02]: hand transplant cocoa or take a container
and go into a deconstruction room and
[SPEAKER_02]: rinse it and clean it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, labor, again, is going to be your
biggest thing and all these things are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to give you the efficiencies that
you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think he's going to cover the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check,
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, so I've heard a lot of debate over
just kind of a general question here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of debate over having multiple
smaller rooms or having one larger room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about what would be more
efficient or what's your opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So and I didn't touch base on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is this long going controversy
and primarily it's really more about
[SPEAKER_02]: containment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have smaller rooms where we
can control bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We control pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: If Tom is going into room one,
then he's going into room two and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: an infestation of room one, where's the
containment?
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's delusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless one person is going in and out of
each room, it's never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also controls become much more
intricate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much more difficult to control a
bunch of small rooms versus larger rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a larger room, we design larger
rooms, primarily two reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, control becomes a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: The larger the room is, the more volume of
air you have, the less modulations you
[SPEAKER_02]: have in your environmental controls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 12 foot ceilings is a little low.
[SPEAKER_02]: 14 or 15 foot ceilings makes a lot more
sense because even though you have this
[SPEAKER_02]: air above the lights, the lights are your
vessel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cooling, that is everything is based on
your lighting load.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have the space up here,
but that's conditioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if temperatures start to rise,
you have this volume of air to help buffer
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your modulations are a lot slower,
which is what you want, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, this is what we've been doing
for about five or six years, larger rooms
[SPEAKER_02]: versus small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to do the small rooms and then
realize, yeah, this isn't the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the problem with the vertical is not
necessarily about the size of the room
[SPEAKER_02]: does matter, but it's about you have two
different levels of plants that are
[SPEAKER_02]: transpiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have from top to bottom,
you've got two levels of temperature load
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether you're LED or you're growing
with a high pressure sodium or something
[SPEAKER_02]: that has more heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's just say real quick,
a watt's a watt's a watt.
[SPEAKER_02]: The law of physics is very clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: To generate that one watt, there's going
to be heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because an LED doesn't have radiant
heat, it has dispersed heat coming through
[SPEAKER_02]: a ballast or a driver is heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nonetheless, there is no LED is the magic
answer to heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the first level, there's heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second level is heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heat rises, transpiration will rise and
then drop back down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you have this lower level of
humidity that you have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: The higher level is going to have less
because the light load and heat load is
[SPEAKER_02]: higher up there and it's going to burn off
a bit more that humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more problem really comes in the
off hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the lights turn off because when the
cooling shuts down, it hits its target
[SPEAKER_02]: number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say you go from 82 degrees, you come down
to 62.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the HVAC shuts off, the
dehumidification the HVAC was supporting
[SPEAKER_02]: and the lights we're helping with is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to dehumidify that space
because it's going to spike.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will spike and you will have problems
all through the dark hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you get too much humidity in the
room, the plants on a cellular level,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cells themselves will stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they stretch and absorb more
humidity, well then it opens up to if
[SPEAKER_02]: there's anything in that room,
that plant's going to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else has a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you seeing for cost of this for
outdoor grows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Straight outdoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: $50 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most of the cost there is going to
be, I mean, there is some nutrient cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but a lot of it's watering,
watering a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a lot of labor associated
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about what we've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greenhouse has been averaging about $150
is about normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that depends on demographics.
[SPEAKER_02]: The greenhouse, about $150.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on demographics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we built in Desert Pond,
for example, the cost is more because we
[SPEAKER_02]: have to put in infrastructure for cooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to still condition the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're building full mechanical systems
to offset that heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can swing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, about $150, $200.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the indoor side, we're seeing $350 to
$400.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm setting up a nursery in southern
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to go back to your comments
on natural gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that just for water chilling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was that also related to HVAC?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got natural gas coming into my place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hooked up yet, but we're planning
on using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the propagation room, I was reading
some articles on Dark Hardener Street in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had mentioned that they were
analyzing their costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were figuring out that they're
spending more money on dehumidification
[SPEAKER_01]: than they were on cooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure they were using electric
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Electrodehumidification is just like AC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it consumes a truckload of power.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had moved to DX units.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't bought my HVAC systems yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with Energy Trust Oregon and
evaluating everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you had any thoughts on that for
propagation, hardening off room,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's appreciated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, you still need some
dehumidification there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're naturally running higher
humidity, 65%.
[SPEAKER_02]: 70%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really only need to stop it from
peaking past that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the dehumidification that we like to
run, I mean, everything is water-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use a hydronic system where we have
a boiler as a backup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're capturing heat off the chilling
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, there are a couple options in
the dehu side that you could probably take
[SPEAKER_02]: a look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a little bit more efficient than
just running standard electrical.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, supplementing the gas is going
to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on the space and the
budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all those things are going to
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, electrical dehumidification,
not cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got one for you, Jody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that you're continually driving
efficiency to be able to get your price
[SPEAKER_03]: per pound down as the primary driver.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also when I'm down covering and
talking to folks in NorCal, right,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're very much into artisan and
one-acre cab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the flower is better with the shadow
of the farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Small batch artisan kind of stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So setting aside the price per pound for a
moment, right, because obviously that's a
[SPEAKER_03]: really important driver if you want to
play it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of quality of product in the
final flower are you seeing at these level
[SPEAKER_03]: of efficiencies and mechanization versus
smaller traditional gardens that we saw
[SPEAKER_03]: during the Prohibition era where there was
a lot more labor involved and California
[SPEAKER_03]: built its name on the quality of that
product because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but the reality is, is we,
you know, essentially we're building this
[SPEAKER_02]: facility so that it gives us the ability
to grow nothing but high-end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all going to be, you know,
based on certain factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the genetics themselves are going to
play a big role in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do all these things so that we can
grow the best product that we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about just the cash crop and
let's turn as much volume as we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's turn as much volume of high-end
product, you know, because the market is
[SPEAKER_02]: very small when it comes to that high-end
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all of the stuff is so that you can
grow a high-end product and alleviate all
[SPEAKER_02]: those stress points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the stress is what's going to
affect your harvest and your crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from generation to generation,
the more stress that it gets over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years, the less quality that you're going
to have in your genetic and the smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: yields you're going to start seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's, I mean, that's what all these
things are for, is to be in that 8% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: market, in the high-end end of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're going to spend the money
and you're trying to grow a cash crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: why grow lower-level stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's going to cost you the same
amount of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always want to grow the high-end
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the target here, is to grow
better quality product than other guys
[SPEAKER_02]: down the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks not right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
