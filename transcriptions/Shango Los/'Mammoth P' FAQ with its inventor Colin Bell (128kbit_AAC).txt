[SPEAKER_00]: So hey, Colin, thanks again for getting
together with me here for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, thank you for sponsoring
the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we love telling people about Mammoth
Pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since your commercials run on the
Shaping Fire podcast, a lot of people come
[SPEAKER_00]: up to me and ask me about the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say I use the product and I like the
product and what it does for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are four questions that people
are always asking me that I know I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them suboptimum answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not my product, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to go through those questions
with you and just have you answer them the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when people ask me, I can just
send them for this video, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get into those four
questions, for anybody who's not familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Mammoth Pea product from Mammoth
Microbes, will you just explain what it
[SPEAKER_00]: does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Colin Bell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the co-founder of Mammoth Microbes and
the inventor of the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth Pea is a liquid organic microbial
additive that acts as a catalyst to
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize plant phosphorus uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: That allows plants to take up as much
phosphorus naturally as a plant possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: can, which allows the plant to maximize
its health, development, quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: and yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we see when growers apply
Mammoth Pea as an additive in their
[SPEAKER_01]: fertigation or nutrient regime,
that the plants will maximize their
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypic potential, maximizing their
quality, and increase the yield as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We typically see an average of around 60%
increase yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Mammoth Pea additions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the idea of what's actually in the
bottle is a collection of microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: living microbes, and they are helping
change the form of the phosphorus so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: more readily uptakeable by the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's transforming phosphorus from
unavailable forms to bioavailable forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a microbial function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we selected the microbes,
the active consortia of microbes that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth Pea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a concentrated bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bottle of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these microbes function to facilitate
phosphorus liberation to maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: availability for plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus liberation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the four questions that I get
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one, since it is a living
product and you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotic growers are always trying to,
you know, ferment things or make compost
[SPEAKER_00]: teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me, can they just buy one
bottle of Mammoth Pea and then just take
[SPEAKER_00]: little bits of it and incubate it to make
it more right?
[SPEAKER_00]: By adding a little bit of molasses or
something to make it grow and then never
[SPEAKER_00]: have to buy the product again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Conceptually, yes, these are active
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are viable and they will grow in
different substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is maintaining the integrity
of the community structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what happens as we repropagate
communities of microbes over time,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's going to be drift in the
relative abundances of the different
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that relative abundances is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a lot of study to show that the
microbes in Mammoth Pea in those relative
[SPEAKER_01]: abundances do facilitate much higher
phosphorus cycling than the isolates,
[SPEAKER_01]: the individuals or different combinations
of the species they're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that you're going to compromise
the quality of the product over time by
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do recommend plugging it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the reasons we made it so
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 0.6 mL per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the product does last to go along
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can play with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm all about experimenting,
but just know that we have experimented
[SPEAKER_01]: internally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over time, we do see drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we recommend going back to
the main source.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might even carry it out one
generation, but then it'd be nice to start
[SPEAKER_01]: from the original source of the bottle
that you purchased to continue,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just maximizing confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you say drift, if I'm interpreting
right, what you're saying is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, so when you got the bottle,
you've got a particular ratio of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go to try to incubate it
yourself, those microbes are opportunist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's warmer, colder, or there's more
air or less air, it's going to choose
[SPEAKER_00]: different microbes to favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to get out of balance
of what it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of your testing of why Mammoth Pea
works is because of the microbe mix that's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you go and you try to redo it
yourself, you might get drifting
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really the actual product
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, there's confidence in knowing
that you have something very consistent in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Mammoth Pea bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we start to work on trying to scale the
microbes up, just inherently, if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a completely sterile room,
which we have pretty much in our
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities, when we're scaling the bottles
up and wash the bottles and do everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get a lot of issues,
environmental fluctuations, seasonal
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental fluctuation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have contaminants coming in ceasely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really hard to think with
confidence that you can continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: repropagate Mammoth and keep it pristine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to bring up this question,
but I understand that it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: farcical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people will often mention on threads
that there are microbes in the product
[SPEAKER_00]: that are dangerous to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some people say, I won't buy it
because it's got this or another microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the odd thing is that people will
choose different microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the product in any way dangerous to
humans, even if used incorrectly?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you don't want to ingest any
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to ingest any live
microbial product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually had some growers write me
and say, hey, long story short,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ingested some Mammoth Pea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing bad happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try that at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a good idea, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's part of the rigor of the
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to register our product with every
state, with every country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a really sophisticated team of
actually world leaders and soil microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: ecologists early on that we brought on
board to make sure that we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: everything the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're scientists, and we want to bring
value to growers using microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of the microbes and the strains
that we have in Mammoth Pea are bio-level
[SPEAKER_01]: safety one, which means that there is the
very lowest chance of anything bad
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't had any cases ever of
anything like that occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do recommend using safety precautions,
just like any fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wood on the label is just kind of a
generic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had guys producing the product since
day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just no different than brewing a tea,
honestly, the way you're handling Mammoth
[SPEAKER_01]: Pea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference in Mammoth Pea is they're
so functionally targeted that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to use that as a specific clone or bloom
stimulant to maximize the availability of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus for plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this last one, this is the most common
question that I get from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess this is kind of a two-part
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, does it matter when it changes
colors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, how do you figure out what
the expiration date is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both great questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the expiration date on the bottle we
suggest using within one year after
[SPEAKER_01]: opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The expiration date is on every single
bottle on the back, so you can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our shelf life data now is real-time data,
and it's out over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the product is actually viably
good, data-supported, over 27 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saying that, we do still recommend using
it with one year after opening because
[SPEAKER_01]: that continues to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you add that oxygen, it's a different
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the microbial activity actually
increases when you open the bottle,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it's amazing how long these
microbes last in the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not worried about that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that you should follow
recommended applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can use it within two years,
you're going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, just so there's no
misunderstanding, we just gave guidelines
[SPEAKER_01]: on the back of the bottle because
honestly, every time we get more data,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can change all the labels or we just
wait until it goes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first shelf life or recommended use on
the label was six months because we had
[SPEAKER_01]: six months worth of data, so we put that
on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when we had two years, we actually
changed it out a little further.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shelf life's not an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lasts longer than any product I've seen
on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the change in the color part?
[SPEAKER_01]: Change in the color is oxidation that
occurs sometimes, not always, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've dialed in why.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little harder to control.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is life in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is nature in a bottle, and there is
some variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do know is that the guaranteed
analysis is at least the same between the
[SPEAKER_01]: lighter bottles and the darker bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do know also is there's slightly
higher microbial activity and higher
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial concentrations, CFU counts,
in the darker bottles, which means that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually the darker bottles are a little
more effective, probably, than the lighter
[SPEAKER_01]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of growers that use mammoth,
and what they do is they like to grab the
[SPEAKER_01]: darker bottles because they know it's a
little more concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them are very effective and work
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens because as microbial activity
slightly increases, sometimes it can
[SPEAKER_01]: create a slight oxidation event,
which actually colors some of the carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slight change in color has an effect of
slightly higher activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our team still can't figure out how to
normalize that to keep it consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of a mystery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's really hard to control every
aspect of nature, and we're dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil microbes that we're trying to package
for farmers and for growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to have a better answer soon,
but what I do say and stand by is that
[SPEAKER_01]: mammoth pea microbes work, and maybe even
a little better, with a darker color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for answering those questions
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can just move everybody along to
