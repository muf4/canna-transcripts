[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everybody, Shango Lose of Shaping Fire
here on Vashon Island today, and I'm here
[SPEAKER_02]: with my buddy Tyler Marquardt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would love to have a freeze
dryer to make hash, but it's not in the
[SPEAKER_02]: budget yet, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for years I, like many people,
you know, either take the plant material,
[SPEAKER_02]: the hash, and you know, maybe you put it
in a tent with a dehumidifier,
[SPEAKER_02]: or maybe you blow some fans over,
or maybe you do both, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was making hash today, and Tyler
said, hey, you know, I've got this new
[SPEAKER_02]: invention, which is a happy medium between
using a dehumidifier and fans,
[SPEAKER_02]: but isn't quite the cost of a freeze
dryer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, dude, bring it over,
check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just used it on my hash,
and I'm thoroughly impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game changer for me, and I'm going
to start using this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody else in the scene
is using this, but this is the first time
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it in all of my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I asked Ty to take a minute with us and
explain what he's up to with this new
[SPEAKER_02]: tech, or we think it's new tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've got a bunch of pictures and
videos for you so that you can do it
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, Ty, so go ahead and explain
what your solution is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically what we've done is used a
filtration device that you would use
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to making BHO, but it's done with
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lab piece that's called a
Buchner funnel, or a Buckner funnel,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how you're going to pronounce
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it basically has a glass frit disc in
it, and it allows you to hook up a vacuum
[SPEAKER_01]: to it so that you can pull water through.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different chemical uses
in it for chemistry applications in a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were to apply a 25 micron dry
sheet for making bubble hash and ice water
[SPEAKER_01]: sieve hash in there, that would allow you
to put the wet hash on top of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: cover it with a piece of aluminum foil or
some sort of fabric that would seal it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then poke a small hole in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could pull the air through with a
vacuum and pull the water out of the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: and allow it to dry faster and quicker
without having just either air dried,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the cheap medium, or using the
freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was a quick way that we found
within eight hours, we were able to remove
[SPEAKER_01]: one ounce of water from 100 grams of hash
starting wet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after we pulled it out,
we weighed the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 100 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we pulled it through,
and we pulled 30 grams of, or 28 grams of
[SPEAKER_01]: water out of the material, and we almost
filled up an entire shot glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once the water's been pulled out,
and by this point in the video,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've already edited in pictures of it,
so you know what we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've seen it bubble, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty badass.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening is that the vacuum is
pulling all the water through the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: and leaving me with dry-ish hash,
certainly not wet hash anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also not dry to the point where it's
usable right after you finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still working on how long the tech
needs to go to complete, but we're finding
[SPEAKER_01]: that almost within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff that I ran yesterday and did
this process yesterday afternoon and
[SPEAKER_02]: evening is already smokable today,
so in one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, certainly, I'm gonna let it fan dry
for another day or so, but really,
[SPEAKER_02]: it feels done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, and we didn't have any major popping
or anything going like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little bit with just a smed,
a little bit that we first did in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, but after the second test,
it came out good, and from there on,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just seemed like it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so one of the cool things about it
is how inexpensive it is, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So while this is not exactly a
freeze-drying solution, well, it's not at
[SPEAKER_02]: all a freeze-drying solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a solution that's gonna cost you 25
to 35 hundred bucks to get into,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas this costs how much?
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent just under $100 for everything,
so it includes a small vacuum at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Buchner funnel, and then also a beaker,
regular beaker to attach it into.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a lab, if you're licensed
or unlicensed and have a lab, you may
[SPEAKER_02]: already have this stuff in your lab,
and it's just a different way of applying
[SPEAKER_02]: it, and if you're like me and you don't
have a lab or any kind of lab gear,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm able to get all the stuff on Amazon
for under 100 bucks, which is a really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that this pretty much removes
the risk of molding, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got different timings to dry,
but I think that since it's not sopping
[SPEAKER_02]: wet, really your mold risk is very low
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're definitely increasing the
chances of success in reducing the
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination issues and just making it a
lot faster and more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, obviously the air you're sucking past
it needs to be clean, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're sucking moldy air past it,
you're gonna increase your chances because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're increasing the amount it's hitting,
but if you're doing it in clean
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, which obviously you're gonna
aim to do when you're making your hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should be in a pretty good position to
make sure that it dries quickly and you
[SPEAKER_01]: get the most water out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We removed almost 30% of the water in
there, and then there was probably another
[SPEAKER_01]: 5 or 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fast, so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, quickly, and it leaves it with a
nice texture, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a malleable, usable texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't create a texture like freeze
drying does, where it becomes crumbly and
[SPEAKER_01]: dusty at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also doesn't grease out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah, and so you get almost a
toffee or a caramel consistency out of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it would be like a pre-press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a sandy toffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, with the ice water hashes gold
in, gold out, and so we had good runs this
[SPEAKER_01]: time for a good R&D, and it really made
the end product look and come out much
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so anyway, if this has any interest
to you after seeing the video and hearing
[SPEAKER_02]: our little spin about it, go ahead and
check in the description.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some links to the baseline tech
that Tyler developed for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is like REV1, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it works because we've used it,
but we assume that other folks in the
[SPEAKER_02]: scene will build upon this, and we're
going to keep on working on this idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the end, we'll all just keep
sharing with each other and find good DIY
[SPEAKER_02]: tech for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Ty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, man.
Cheers.
Cheers.
