[SPEAKER_00]: There are over 100 cannabinoids found in
cannabis, and more continue to be
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one has a personality, each has
particular uses, and when they all work
[SPEAKER_00]: together, they are at their best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal cannabinoid prohibition influences
the cannabis market in ways that pervert
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the detriment of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though Delta-8-THC is widespread
throughout the country, and many profess
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was made illegal by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm Bill, it is not actually a legal
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its illegality is just not enforced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not what we're covering during
today's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to hear expert legal
analysis on that topic, check out the new
[SPEAKER_00]: video clip from last week's Credo Science
Delta-8 webinar on the Shaping Fire
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel with attorney Lauren
Ruddock.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the webinar highlights you'll find
there, she explains in detail the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: standing of Delta-8 and clarifies many of
the misconceptions.

[SPEAKER_00]: Today's episode is about the Delta-8
molecule itself, how it functions,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it doesn't function, and why how it's
made is so important.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 110.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Russo is a board certified
neurologist and former senior medical
[SPEAKER_00]: advisor to GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: He served as study physician to GW
Pharmaceuticals for three phase three
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials of Sativex.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has held faculty appointments in
pharmaceutical sciences at the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of Montana, in medicine at the University
of Washington, and as visiting professor
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been president of the International
Cannabinoid Research Society and is former
[SPEAKER_00]: chairman of the International Association
for Cannabinoid Medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1995, he pursued a three month
sabbatical doing ethnobotanical research
[SPEAKER_00]: with indigenous people in Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is author of several books of cannabis
medicine and has published over 30
[SPEAKER_00]: articles in neurology, pain management,
cannabis, and ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Russo has joined us several times on
Shaping Fire, episode 22 on treating
[SPEAKER_00]: traumatic brain injury with cannabis and
mushrooms, episodes 11 and 27 about his
[SPEAKER_00]: famous research papers on cannabinoids and
terpenoids, episode number 67 about
[SPEAKER_00]: treating migraines with mushrooms and
cannabis, episode 80 on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperemesis syndrome, episode 83 on
cannabigerol, CBG, episode 103 regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: the life's work of Dr. Rafael Mishulam,
and of course, the shaping fire sessions
[SPEAKER_00]: on shaping fire's YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set today, we will take a
look at the molecular nature of Delta 8
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and its historical milestones.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second set, we will learn about how
Delta 8 is synthesized and how that
[SPEAKER_00]: creates complications for use of this
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the third set, we will explore
some of the lesser discussed attributes of
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 8, including its propensity to cause
failed drug tests and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperemesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had another first this morning
while setting up here in my office studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I can leave a window cracked
facing the water for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the good salt water smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today I had to close it because the
sea lions have decided to have a party on
[SPEAKER_00]: the beach below my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you can just hear them
honking away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a little test and you could
actually hear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, well, that would,
that would give people a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of place, but also probably not
appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't the first time that animals
have played a role in one of your Shaping
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may recall that five years ago we were
recording and I had to ask you to hold for
[SPEAKER_00]: a moment because my neighbors' cows had
found their way into my yard and were
[SPEAKER_00]: eating all of my tulips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you were kind to wait for a minute
while I shooed them out of the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The animals want their voices heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this island's definitely theirs as
much of them or maybe even more than ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so thank you for being here,
Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's get started right off at the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so many people refer to Delta-8
tetrahydrocannabinol as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: D-8, Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants to shorten it and everyone
just kind of like assumes they,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, other people know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but since this is a, this is a good,
you know, primer on what's going on with
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8 in the cannabis scene,
I think we should start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you please describe what Delta-8
is chemically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a normal trace compound found
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It differs from the more expected Delta-9
THC only in the fact that a double bond in
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the rings is in a different
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, apparently the plant
doesn't have any enzymes to make this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it appears in trace amounts,
even in fresh material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly under the influence of heat,
it may appear in greater concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a natural component and it is
more stable to heat than Delta-9 is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one caveat confuses me because if
the plant doesn't have a way to make it,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you suggesting that A, there is enough
heat that happens during harvesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: some amount of cannabinoid is synthesized
into Delta-8?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you saying that we just haven't
figured out yet how the plant makes
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if it's there, it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's the latter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how it's doing it,
but plants are very resourceful and it may
[SPEAKER_01]: have some trick that doesn't involve the
customary enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great when there are,
when we get to point out new research
[SPEAKER_00]: that's looking to be done for all the
folks moving into the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Delta-9 is the form of THC that,
you know, we're so familiar with and
[SPEAKER_00]: humans love so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is Delta-8 different from Delta-9
chemically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you know, if we look at the
molecular weight, it's the same in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of most reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does differ in its affinity for the CB1
receptor, the psychoactive receptor in the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is not quite as potent, but
basically most of its activity would be
[SPEAKER_01]: similar rather than distinct from Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a very involved experiment
going on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't quite been completed by Ryan
Vondray at Johns Hopkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some preliminary results on it,
but they haven't gotten through the full
[SPEAKER_01]: contingent of subjects for that study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will learn more, but there are more
similarities than differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really surprises me because,
you know, most people that I have spoken
[SPEAKER_00]: with say that, you know, they'll struggle
to describe what Delta-8 feels like to
[SPEAKER_00]: them, but they're always describing it as
feeling different than Delta-9,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we will often, you know,
we will describe as a euphoric,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, it sounds like we'll get more to
the bottom of this after this new study,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in its essence, are you saying that
we're finding that Delta-8 actually feels
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty similar to Delta-9, except that
it's more like at a 60% potency?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a really reasonable way to
characterize it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That surprises me.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may have a reduced, but similar
euphoric effect as Delta-9 does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a bit about the similar medical
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not only do we love the
experience of taking in Delta-9 THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it also has got long heralded medical
benefits of being an anti-inflammatory and
[SPEAKER_00]: an analgesic and an anti-mimetic,
meaning, you know, anti-nausea,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with a whole bunch of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does Delta-8 have any of those similar
medical applications, or maybe we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite likely, but again, there could be
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only been one real clinical study
done with Delta-8, and that was clear back
[SPEAKER_01]: in 1995.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a study by Abrahamov and
Mishulam.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used pure Delta-8 THC, so not what
people commonly have access to here,
[SPEAKER_01]: we should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use this in relatively high doses to
children that had blood cancers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, mainly leukemia and the like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was given to counteract nausea
and vomiting associated with the
[SPEAKER_01]: chemotherapy that they were getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were 480 total applications,
administrations of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was almost uniformly effective in
allaying the nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that was interesting was
they seemed to tolerate very high doses
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to that that would have been used
in adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that just highlights something that
was known, say, in the 19th century,
[SPEAKER_01]: that young children seem to be resistant
to the psychoactive effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sure is explanatory a bit around how we
see young children use THC cannabis oil
[SPEAKER_00]: without getting really stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the younger kids can get relief
from their symptoms without the
[SPEAKER_00]: accompanying intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always wondered about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any explanation for why kids
seem to be able to tolerate that aspect of
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the tongue-in-cheek explanation
would be that kids act like they're stoned
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the more serious explanation would
probably have to do with the density of
[SPEAKER_01]: CB1 receptors in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning that they don't have them
developed yet, and so they're not taking
[SPEAKER_00]: it on board as fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not as expressed as,
say, in an older person, an adolescent or
[SPEAKER_01]: adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to the idea that Dr. Mishulam et
al were using a large amount of Delta-8
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate, which you're right, we don't have
easy access to here right now for lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons that we'll talk about more later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is normally when you've been on
Shaping Fire before to talk about other
[SPEAKER_00]: novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is normally when I say,
well, if the isolate is good, does this
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid work more effectively in a
whole plant preparation instead of an
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've already said that there's only
trace amounts of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any analysis to support that
Delta-8's presence or not in such small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts in a whole plant preparation has
any meaning at all, any substantial
[SPEAKER_00]: impact?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer's probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was addressed quite well by a study
that's now 50 years old,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kearney-Allen-Carolini in Brazil back in
1973, actually did comparative studies in
[SPEAKER_01]: man, also in animals, comparing Delta-8
and Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are very carefully done studies
that answer some of those questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because Delta-8 proved to be half as
effective as Delta-9 in causing rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: heart rate tachycardia, Delta-8 was 30%
less effective in producing impairment of
[SPEAKER_01]: time estimation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had less psychoactive value
according to people's subjective scores,
[SPEAKER_01]: how they rated their psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their conclusion was because of the low
concentration of Delta-8 in natural
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, that it probably had very little
effect, would be swamped by the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should add at this time that we have
no indication that we could selectively
[SPEAKER_01]: breed for higher Delta-8 THC
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had heard that before, but earlier in
the show already you had mentioned that we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually don't know how Delta-8 even comes
into being in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the early signs that we're
getting this idea that it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult or unlikely that we could
selectively breed for increased Delta-8?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, because there seemingly are
no enzymes that would make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been a lot of cannabis
breeding going on and nothing has appeared
[SPEAKER_01]: that seems to have significantly more
Delta-8 concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just don't have a path forward for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's unclear to me that it would be
worth the expenditure of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: money, and effort either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, whether or not it makes sense from a
market point of view is definitely true,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you and I are here saying
that there's no way to selectively breed
[SPEAKER_00]: for increased Delta-8, if I was a breeder
and hearing that, that sounds like a dare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there is some established botanical
reason why we see a blockage in that path
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding, I figured this would be a
good time to bring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that now is probably a
good time to say we're gonna talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: about this later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can imagine listeners asking the
question to themselves, well, then where
[SPEAKER_00]: the hell does all this Delta-8 come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And spoiler alert, we're gonna tell you
during the second set that nowadays it is
[SPEAKER_00]: almost entirely synthesized from CBD,
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll answer that question now,
but we'll get into that more during the
[SPEAKER_00]: second set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ethan, if Delta-8 is less potent than
Delta-9 and the high is not as delightful,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the medicinal benefit isn't as
substantial, it seems to me that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: an obvious market reason why such an
inferior cannabinoid is being used in so
[SPEAKER_00]: many states in place of simply using
traditional Delta-9 cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first, I'm not sure I'd use the word
inferior.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is inferior from the standpoint of
quality control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really the issue with Delta-8 is that
it is synthesized, that the material
[SPEAKER_01]: that's produced is not pure, that there
can be all these byproducts about which we
[SPEAKER_01]: know very little in terms of their
activity or safety, and the possibility of
[SPEAKER_01]: residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the answer is because people make money
doing it, and because of these
[SPEAKER_01]: interpretations of the law, in some
instances that Delta-8 is legal,
[SPEAKER_01]: people have been taking excess CBD and
turning it into Delta-8 as a way to use it
[SPEAKER_01]: and make money with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, in some instances, because
there have been 0.3% Delta-9 restrictions,
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictions on concentration,
people have tried to get around that by
[SPEAKER_01]: spiking things with Delta-8 of synthetic
origin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a market issue that is based on
what I'm going to say is a misconception
[SPEAKER_01]: of the available law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way or another, we can parse out
the law, but more importantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer seems to me to be just straight
up prohibition, that if we had federally
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized cannabis, that the market for
Delta-8 would instantaneously disappear
[SPEAKER_00]: except for the small group of cannabis
patients who have unique issues that
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8 can address, like the children
during chemotherapy that you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important to point out
because we will be talking today about a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the challenges to using Delta-8 in
the market as it presently functions
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these questions are only happening,
and people who are incorporating Delta-8
[SPEAKER_00]: into their products, none of this would be
happening if it weren't for federal
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition of the preferred sibling,
Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me state this clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The current craze about Delta-8 THC is a
byproduct of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get any clearer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings us to wanting to understand
a bit about how we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was fortunate to catch your
webinar a couple of weeks ago about the
[SPEAKER_00]: history of Delta-8 and its uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got the historical milestones
for Delta-8 in a really nice, tight
[SPEAKER_00]: package now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what I'd like to do at this
point would just be to hand you the mic
[SPEAKER_00]: and just let you go for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please just teach us about the
historical milestones to Delta-8 that
[SPEAKER_00]: bring us to where we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have to go way back to the fourth
century on what was then Palestine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a skeleton that was found in a
cave in Beit Shemesh, which is about
[SPEAKER_01]: midway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this cave, there was the skeleton of
what appeared to be a 14-year-old young
[SPEAKER_01]: woman who apparently died in childbirth.
[SPEAKER_01]: In her pelvis was an undelivered full-term
fetus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next to her, there was this carbonized
fragment of material that, when analyzed,
[SPEAKER_01]: showed Delta-8 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as I mentioned previously,
that's more heat stable than Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that it was there indicates
that this was psychoactive material that
[SPEAKER_01]: apparently had been burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the analysis of the situation was that
this cannabis was burned in an effort to
[SPEAKER_01]: aid delivery of the baby, which in this
instance didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there's been thousands of years
of history of successful use of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: for this purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first Delta-8 I know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we've got to go clear up to about
1942.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an American scientist named
Roger Adams who did a lot of work in
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis and synthesis related to
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, in 1940, he sort of almost got
the structure of cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had a bunch of this and synthesized
what he called tetrahydrocannabinols from
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but it wasn't pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were at least two forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: What he found out was when administered to
dogs, this made them wobbly on their feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's called static ataxia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then and earlier, this was a test for
cannabis preparations as to their potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took some of this material,
actually 30 milligrams of what likely at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point was Delta-8 THC, put it in
olive oil capsules, and then tested these
[SPEAKER_01]: on convicts in New York, 77 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is interesting because I think
people will see the similarities of
[SPEAKER_01]: effects to Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the Delta-8 capsules, they got
onset orally in 30 to 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It peaked somewhere between three and a
half to five hours and was gone after
[SPEAKER_01]: seven hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effects, again, were quite analogous
to Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had increased heart rate,
a little bit of increased blood pressure,
[SPEAKER_01]: faster breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their eyes got red.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got dry mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some got wobbly on their feet,
recognizing there was a somewhat higher
[SPEAKER_01]: dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some got anxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some were euphoric.
[SPEAKER_01]: They talked a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed to lower inhibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those who were familiar with the term felt
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were bursts of laughter and some
drowsiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they did experiments and showed that
with prolonged usage, there was tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: to these psychoactive effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, interestingly, they made a
distinction in humans between inmates and
[SPEAKER_01]: what they called high-ranking individuals
and industrialists who also tried this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the effects were quite the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may show you that businessmen at a
high level aren't that different than
[SPEAKER_01]: convicts, but enough political commentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subsequently, some of the same material,
15 milligrams of what was likely Delta-8
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, was again used on convicts in New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is part of what's called the
LaGuardia Report that came out in 1944.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they used this to test bowel
withdrawal from narcotics, specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: morphine or heroin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they compared this 15 milligrams of
Delta-8 THC to what was called Magendy
[SPEAKER_01]: solution, which was just a form of
morphine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, they found that this helped with
the withdrawal, reduced the symptoms,
[SPEAKER_01]: and people were able to leave the hospital
after treatment, seemingly in better
[SPEAKER_01]: condition than those who got no treatment
or got the morphine substitute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were able to eat on some actually
gained weight during withdrawal,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not what we usually expect with
opiates.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, we've got to go clear up to
the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, Professor Mishalum and his
colleagues were working out all the
[SPEAKER_01]: structures of cannabis components from
hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in 1963, they figured out the
absolute structure of cannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in 1964, Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1966, they showed that you could turn
cannabidiol into Delta-8 THC through a
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two nasty things heated together with
benzene and what's called Rho toluene
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfonic acid, and they could make Delta-8
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That and similar schemes have come down to
us in the current time as a way to make
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta-8 THC from CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were some more experiments
that were done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, in 66, it was shown that you could
find some tiny amounts of Delta-8 in fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dean of American Cannabis Studies in
the 60s and early 70s with Leo Hollister,
[SPEAKER_01]: he tested Delta-8 THC, 20 and 40
milligrams as compared to 20 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, they put this in chocolate
cookies, but the effects were
[SPEAKER_01]: qualitatively very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Euphoria, tranquility, difficulty
thinking, rapid thoughts, decreased
[SPEAKER_01]: memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: The time frame he got was onset in 30 to
90 minutes orally, peaking after two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half to three hours with residual symptoms
up to five hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, again, there seemed to be a lower
psychoactivity head to head, perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta-8 being about 63% of the potency of
Delta-9 as I calculate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be in keeping with what
people have said previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I previously mentioned the study of
Carniola and Carlini in 1973 in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their findings were really quite similar
to the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: They essentially thought it was about 30%
less psychoactive and very careful studies
[SPEAKER_01]: for the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So compared to what we're doing now,
they're really valid studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, really not much happened
beyond Abrahamov and Mishulim's study in
[SPEAKER_01]: 1995, clear up until a few years ago when
suddenly Delta-8 appeared in great
[SPEAKER_01]: profusion as a way to get rid of surplus
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that's actually a great setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we start set too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that explanation of those
historical milestones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's go ahead and take our break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we come back, we'll pick up
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is neurologist and
cannabis researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options in who to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_00]: ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend Gaslamp Seeds to my friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners who are looking for a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably already know Gaslamp Seeds as
HEMBRA genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: HEMBRA recently changed their name to
Gaslamp Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp Seeds is not just another seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp is a female-operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: With over 60 breeders and over a thousand
strains to choose from, you will certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: find something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp Seeds has something for everyone
with over 650 feminized strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 regular varieties, and over 200
autoflowers to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Names you know you can trust like compound
genetics, Humboldt Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Owl, In-House, FastBuds,
Gnome Automatics, and Ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money but have no
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited Gaslamp to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_00]: about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have A-plus customer service with
lightning fast response times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will get
your order out the same day you place it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most seed banks are simply not this
organized or interested in getting your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to you so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Gaslamp Seeds cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even get free seeds with every order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helene and Caitlin get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been in the cannabis growing
scene for over a decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want some extra freebies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the code ShapingFire, all one word,
at checkout, and they will give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: additional set of Gaslamp-provided
freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an extra $30 in free seeds.

[SPEAKER_00]: That's Gaslamp Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an
all-natural fish poop concentrate with
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real fish poop is extraordinarily complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you adding the nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium your plants need
[SPEAKER_00]: to build mass, transport nutrients,
and enhance flavor, but fish waste is also
[SPEAKER_00]: packed with biological activity and
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add fish poop to your irrigation
water, you are adding life force,
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotics, and active microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microorganisms include a wealth of
various bacteria and protozoa which
[SPEAKER_00]: further enhance nutrient availability for
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because plants are limited by the absence
of any essential micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_00]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop is a naturally complete solution
that fills in the cracks in your
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer program to ensure you offer
your garden a broad base of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all fish poop is created equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most products with added fish waste don't
reveal their sources or lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop brand fish poop, however,
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_00]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: koi and tilapia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are even invited to tour their farm in
person or on their YouTube channel to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sort of transparency is wildly rare
in the fertilizer market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks behind fish poop are also
lifelong medical cannabis producers who
[SPEAKER_00]: have deep connections in the community,
donate more product than they sell,
[SPEAKER_00]: and support cannabis prisoner,
veteran, and patient collectives and
[SPEAKER_00]: charities.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get your bottle of pure fish poop,
go to fishpoop.com and to see their entire
[SPEAKER_00]: line of cannabis products, go to
ounceofhope.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fish poop brand fish poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses everywhere are striving to
reach people through advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know, though, that trying to reach
a cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_00]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers is essential, and that is what
we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and help our audience get in contact with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising does not have to be all
whiz-bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot well, you can do that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: During these pandemic days, conventions
and cannabis events are pretty poorly
[SPEAKER_00]: attended, but podcast listening is
skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a commercial on Shaping Fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_00]: of their headphones right now and will
continue to reach new listeners as they
[SPEAKER_00]: explore the Shaping Fire back catalog of
episodes again and again for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spot on Shaping Fire costs less than a
printed postcard per person, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire audience is full of smart
cannabis enthusiasts, cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: and entrepreneurs who are always curious
to learn.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is neurologist and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we were bringing us
up historically to what is happening now
[SPEAKER_00]: where most folks, or nearly everyone who
is incorporating Delta-8 THC into their
[SPEAKER_00]: products is doing so from Delta-8 that has
been synthesized from CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a reminder that the reason why they're
not taking it directly from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is because the amounts are so low,
so barely there in trace forms that for
[SPEAKER_00]: both labor and financial reasons,
trying to pull it out of a great deal of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material just doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because you can synthesize CBD,
excuse me, you can synthesize Delta-8 THC
[SPEAKER_00]: from CBD, and we had this huge glut of CBD
on the market just, what, three years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: now, that the price of the CBD raw bulk
material, the bulk plant material was so
[SPEAKER_00]: low that it made sense to pull out cheap
CBD out of these hemp plants and then go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the lab and synthesize it into Delta-8
THC, which even though it's less potent,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a way to cause a high and
therefore is a way to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Ethan, what I'd like you to explain
right now, it's kind of like a two-part
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of us who don't have lab
experience, the idea of synthesizing
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8 THC from CBD is kind of nothing
but words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you could generally explain what
it means to do that in the lab and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what that's like, so we can picture that
in our heads, what it is to synthesize
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second part, which is part of
your answer, is that the point of our
[SPEAKER_00]: concern about Delta-8 is that so many
contaminants come along with it from the
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis process, which then gets passed
down to consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the crux of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like you to explain the synthesis
and why there are contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's an important
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say that we have a bunch of
starting material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be crystalline CBD that
originally came from the plant or even
[SPEAKER_01]: could be from a synthetic source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, this would be dissolved in some
kind of organic solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they often will use things like
hexane, which is something you'd find in
[SPEAKER_01]: gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something you'd want to ingest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's heated in the presence of an
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that closes a ring on cannabidiol and
produces Delta-8 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sounds fine, except then you've
got to get rid of the solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Presumably with some kind of drying or
evaporation technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there always could be residuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a source of toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real problem here is this isn't a
one-to-one proposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, you don't get all the CBD
turned only into Delta-8 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather, there are all these other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we're going to get into some fancy
names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here Delta-4-8-ISO-THC,
9-ethoxyhexahydrocannabinol, and even
[SPEAKER_01]: getting new things that hadn't been
discovered before, like
[SPEAKER_01]: isotetrahydrocannabifuran.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are things about which we know
little or nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be that some of these substances
are OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be that they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are potentially toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some could be actually more psychoactive
than Delta-9-THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably get into some other nasties
that have been found in Delta-8 products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it is extremely unlikely that
any commercial product with Delta-8 in it
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to only have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will have these potentially toxic
byproducts and potentially toxic solvent
[SPEAKER_01]: residues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, if you're using these
products, it's a crapshoot as to what's
[SPEAKER_01]: really in there and what bad effects they
might have, either acutely or particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: if taken on a chronic basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, product manufacturers who
are using Delta-8, they get a test done
[SPEAKER_00]: that's perhaps needed for their state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one way or another, there's a test
done at some point of what the isolate is
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are purchasing or making,
and it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, it looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But isn't the science that to find any of
these contaminants, you actually have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be using standards to actually see them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And since there is all of this chemical
static in the isolate that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: resultant, that many people may actually
think they're using an air quotes clean
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate of Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the costs are so preventative to check
for all of the toxic items that that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of research is not being done on their
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very likely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you said is quite right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is this blip on a screen,
whatever kind of analytical test is being
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's going to remain unknown
unless you have a standard, a pure
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical that you've used in your analysis
that tells you what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some of these compounds,
there aren't any standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the analytical studies that have
been done, they figure it out using
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced instrumentation and comparison
with the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are just not necessarily
available in your friendly neighborhood
[SPEAKER_01]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have struggled a bit with the idea of
Delta-8 being natural or a synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: because synthetic and natural both seem to
be inexact words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I originally learned about Delta-8 as
a synthetic, something that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more I speak with scientists,
they say what you have said, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: there's such a trace amount that it does
occur in the implant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not exactly sure how it occurs in
the plant, but it's there in trace
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to say that Delta-8 is then natural
seems to be a bit of a misnomer because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not the Delta-8 that is used in the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's used for product manufacturing is,
I dare say, always going to be Delta-8
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been synthesized from cannabidiol,
which is synthetic because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanted to hear whatever your
thoughts were on these messy use of
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic versus natural in an isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to keep it quite simple,
basically any consumer product advertising
[SPEAKER_01]: itself as containing Delta-8THC is of
synthetic origin and subject to all the
[SPEAKER_01]: caveats and warnings that we've already
discussed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets worse from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of these products may
contain Delta-8THC-O acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole problem with this group of
compounds, the esters.
[SPEAKER_01]: When these are vaporized, they can produce
something called ketenes, which are toxic
[SPEAKER_01]: to the lungs and have been associated with
this problem with the lungs called EVALI,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is an acronym for something very
ominous called e-cigarette or vaping
[SPEAKER_01]: product use associated lung injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: People may have heard this term in
relation to the vitamin E acetate scandal
[SPEAKER_01]: of a few years ago where vitamin E acetate
was put in vape pens as sort of a carrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a consistency that was sort of like
cannabis concentrates and it was put in
[SPEAKER_01]: vape pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a number of people were hospitalized
and there were some deaths due to
[SPEAKER_01]: pulmonary damage from this kind of
compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing could happen with any of
these acetates that are sometimes seen as
[SPEAKER_01]: toxic byproducts of Delta-8THC production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually Delta-8THC-O acetate has been
demonstrated on vape pens, something
[SPEAKER_01]: called blue drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is shown by Benowitz et al.
[SPEAKER_01]: on an article earlier this year and they
pointed out how this Delta-8THC acetate,
[SPEAKER_01]: when subjected to heat, produced this
ketene, which again is the lung damaging
[SPEAKER_01]: compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same thing potentially could happen
with any Delta-8 vape pen if it had
[SPEAKER_00]: similar contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so let's tease out that nuance a
little bit because I think that it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: crux of this essentially the entire
episode that Delta-8 in a perfect world
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was isolated properly in a lab
and then after the fact was cleaned up to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove contaminants, which is a very
lengthy and arduous process and takes
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced skills that Delta-8 as a medicine
does have applications and does cause a
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% euphoria effect, 60% of what Delta-9
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that's not the world we live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world we live in is that folks without
enough experience are isolating Delta-8,
[SPEAKER_00]: not cleaning it up afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't have the experience to know
everything that they need to be pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have the budget or the lab to
identify the toxic contaminants and remove
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the Delta-8 that is being
dumped onto the market that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesized from CBD from hemp from the
last three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the problem is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not scientifically true Delta-8
the problem is in the reality that people
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't putting out pure Delta-8 and it's
actually got all these extra contaminants
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean quite right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the way I'd put it succinctly is
Delta-8 THC, the molecule or compound is
[SPEAKER_01]: not the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is how that Delta-8 THC is
produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the toxic byproducts and
solvent residues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, don't blame the compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compound's all right, but how it's made
and available to consumers is the problem
[SPEAKER_01]: and potentially a very big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a popular study from 2021 that
looked at this case of Delta-8 from CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: being synthesized and being sprayed on
Delta-9 flour to make it more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I believe subsequently they were
taking products from the licensed market
[SPEAKER_00]: where there should not be Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were all of these products that
had Delta-8 in it kind of like to fortify
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience of the regular Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a fortified vitamin or a
fortified alcohol or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we wanna make it more strong and
so we're gonna add something extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people are adding Delta-8 and not
mentioning it on the label because in most
[SPEAKER_00]: states it's not supposed to be in their
licensed market, but they add Delta-8 so
[SPEAKER_00]: that their product has what they think is
an improved experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain what the downside would be
for people to be buying products that have
[SPEAKER_00]: got Delta-8 in it without their knowledge?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's unconscionable practice and I
would condemn anyone who engages in that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, again, it's a matter of
not knowing what you're getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: the likelihood of overdose, if in a vape
pen, the possibilities of lung damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been demonstrated, there've
actually been studies that show that use
[SPEAKER_01]: rates of Delta-8 products are way higher
in states that have restrictive cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: policies as opposed to those that have
freer access to natural cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this stuff is not without
risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a study earlier this year,
Simon et al, there's a reporting system at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Food and Drug Administration for
non-prescription drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the FAERS system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've had a massive increase in
reports associated with Delta-8 products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give a rundown, 33 deaths
attributed to Delta-8 products,
[SPEAKER_01]: 49 hospitalizations, 109 serious reports,
41 non-serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one will surprise people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were more respiratory issues,
problems with the lungs that were reported
[SPEAKER_01]: for Delta-8 THC products than any cannabis
or hemp product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that puts it in context.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these things are not without risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is quite in contrast to the claims
that have sometimes been made.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a paper that was published,
wouldn't have gotten past me if I reviewed
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but in 2022, Kruger and Kruger
published a study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just an online survey of people
using Delta-8 products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they reported that I don't know how
they made their comparisons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be scientific, but they
reported Delta-8 was less intense,
[SPEAKER_01]: produced relaxation and euphoria,
that it relieved pain, but also was
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with short-term memory
impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a comment from one consumer that
got in the title of the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the quote was, Delta-8 feels like
Delta-9's nicer young sibling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just not borne out by the
figures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the conclusion of the article was,
quote, Delta-8 THC may provide much of the
[SPEAKER_01]: experiential benefits of Delta-9 THC with
lesser adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just plain wrong and never should
have been in a published scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: article.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't cast aspersions on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the publisher, but I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this adds a lot to the
confusion that we see amongst consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: about Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of came into the Delta-8
understanding, being prejudiced against
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8, I gotta admit, because I was only
ever seeing it in really low quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: unlicensed market products that were very
low priced in states where cannabis wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's be clear off the top that the
fact that it's unlicensed doesn't actually
[SPEAKER_00]: bother me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk a lot about individual patient
freedoms and to grow your own on this
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does get me is when a product is
of crappy quality, period, whether it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the licensed or in the unlicensed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I first started seeing
Delta-8, it was in these states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And $10 vape cartridges in really bad
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could just tell like, oh man,
somebody's gonna get really sick from this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so certainly there are products in the
unlicensed market that are quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: but certainly that's not most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are low quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there are papers like the one
you just referred to that product
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers can grasp on to and say,
hey, look, here's a study that says that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's safe and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates enough confusion in the market
where people aren't educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they buy what they can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these products are finding
themselves more into states that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: legal and then people who are low income,
which is such a drag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also found it interesting that there's
an ASTN white paper in 2021 pointing out
[SPEAKER_00]: that the instructions for synthesizing
Delta-8 are easily found on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not as simple as it's often
presented on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't have the skills to do it
safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the study says it results in wildly
unintended consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are those unintended consequences the
same toxic components that we've already
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to or is something even further
than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically they referred in that white
paper to acetic acid available in your
[SPEAKER_01]: kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Translating, that means vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there would be ways of making this with
vinegar and heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I don't trust a lab to do this
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would we have any inkling that someone
doing this as a kitchen chemist would have
[SPEAKER_01]: better luck in what they produce?
[SPEAKER_01]: No one should ever try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to wrap us up here in set two,
and I know we're putting a pretty sharp
[SPEAKER_00]: point on this, but I don't think that we
can put too sharp of a point on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, hey, Delta-8 is in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been using the plant for thousands
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8 has a natural origin and natural
products are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore they say that Delta-8 in
their products is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just not the right way to think
about it, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wrap up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In set three, we're gonna start talking
about some of the unexpected attributes of
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the interesting questions
about Delta-8 and how to think about it
[SPEAKER_00]: that just haven't fit into the show so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be kind of a hodgepodge of
interesting Delta-8 topics, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our second
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is neurologist and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert has the beneficial insects,
mites and nematodes, microbials,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky cards, and air distribution units
you need to partner with nature to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_00]: from chemical sprays towards clean and
natural solutions.

[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the topics I want to share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has follow-up
posts to Shaping Fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: my successes and failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: in my own garden, insights and best
practices from personal grows everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: and always gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_00]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis seed market is filled with
big name and hype breeders fighting to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And occasionally, you discover a breeder
who is breeding because it is the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing they care to do, and they would be
doing it even if they never made a dime.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my friend Craig Hartzah,
who makes seeds as magnetic genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craig comes from five generations of
farmers and is earning his master's degree
[SPEAKER_00]: in horticulture right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been growing cannabis for 15 years
and been breeding for nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't sold many seeds because he
really isn't a sales guy, but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: personally been growing his seeds for
years, and I know I can always rely on him
[SPEAKER_00]: on his seeds to germinate, thrive,
and smell and taste great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggested to Craig that he should
probably sell some seeds and asked if he
[SPEAKER_00]: had enough stockpiled to bother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much to my shock, he was sitting on five
full menus in cold storage that he
[SPEAKER_00]: produced in the last two years and hadn't
even tried to sell any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was simply too busy breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we, his friends, convinced him to
make his damn seeds available to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people, and now they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time anywhere, you can now
buy magnetic genetics seeds at Neptune
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed Bank and on strainly.io.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neptune Seed Bank has just picked up
magnetic genetics for a trial to gauge
[SPEAKER_00]: your interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are carrying three strains from his
Mean Mug, Prominence, and Turpinado menus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are exclusive to Neptune.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy way to score his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pick up those menus plus his
Hillbilly Skunk and Candy Breath Crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: and more on his profile page on strainly
.io.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want very affordable seeds that are
exceptional quality with rare turpin
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles from a good guy, go to
Neptuneseedbank.com or strainly.io.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is fun to buy the hype thing
from the brand you admire, but when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to buy the strain you'll love from
an obscure mad scientist, you're ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: magnetic genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magneticgenetics.org and on Instagram,
magneticgenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is neurologist and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in the last set, we're gonna talk
mostly about things that like didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really fit in the rest of the show,
and there's some really interesting stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: about Delta that we haven't touched on
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing I wanna talk about,
Ethan, is that, you know, we mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: early way back in the first set that
Delta-8 works effectively as an
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-mimetic in kids who are experiencing
chemotherapy, meaning that it decreases
[SPEAKER_00]: their nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we found anything else that Delta-8
can do, well, I guess anything at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: because Delta-9 may actually be better
than Delta-8 for this, but have we found
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that Delta-8 can do that
naturally occurring Delta-9 THC and the
[SPEAKER_00]: other naturally occurring cannabinoids
don't do better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything unique that Delta-8 can
do that the other cannabinoids can't do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and it would be its stability to
heat, as demonstrated in the ancient
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suppose there could be some
jurisdictions around the world where they
[SPEAKER_01]: had a law that specifically cited Delta-9
THC and didn't cite Delta-8, and it might
[SPEAKER_01]: be possible there to use Delta-8
preferentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that's a legal point,
not a medical point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So its thermal stability is its main
selling point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the thermal stability something that is
actually a health benefit, or is that more
[SPEAKER_00]: a, oh, because it's more thermally stable,
it makes it a good choice for some
[SPEAKER_00]: particular pharmaceutical products that
have gotta be heated?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be that kind of situation or
shelf life issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't see this as being commercially
developed in any capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning now or in the future or both?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because to make a Delta-8
prescription product, it's going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to go through years of testing and
hundreds of millions of dollars in
[SPEAKER_01]: expenditure to get it through phase one to
three clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see anybody doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the promise of it doesn't seem to
justify that much time and resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, two points.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is it wouldn't be worth the
investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, it's never going to do what
herbal cannabis in a proper preparation
[SPEAKER_01]: can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be the place where I
typically invoke the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you go ahead and invoke it for
those who aren't familiar with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing that pure tea can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really benefit from having additional
cannabinoids and terpenoids that reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: the side effect profile of THC in either
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes for a better, more tolerable,
and more effective medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always love to support the whole plant
medicine thinking here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during Shaping Fire episode 14,
all the way back five years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: with Dr. Greg Gerdman, we discussed how
synthetic cannabinoids can sometimes be
[SPEAKER_00]: used in the lab as a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not as something that a human is
actually going to ingest for a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, but something that can be used in
the lab as a tool to do one or other
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment or process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you explain briefly how synthetic
cannabinoids can be useful in a lab
[SPEAKER_00]: setting?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also whether you're aware of any
useful tool that Delta-8 has become in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there have actually been hundreds of
synthetic cannabinoids that have been used
[SPEAKER_01]: in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these are extremely potent as
compared to Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those can be useful in pointing out
pathways or the patterns of the receptors
[SPEAKER_01]: in a given organ, especially the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just tools that are used that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're often used in animal studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe it or not, it's easier to acquire
a lot of these synthetics than it is to
[SPEAKER_01]: get permission to use Delta-9 in such
experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rats are not humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular, there've been some
distinctions in the affinity of Delta-8
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabinoid receptors in certain
species of animals as compared to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hate to say this, but you can only
learn so much from animal studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are distinct differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any such literature has to be read
with that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting, but it may not
translate to human clinical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that there are folks that are
using Delta-8 as a tool in the lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that not necessarily one of the
synthetic cannabinoids that has use in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab in that way?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say a great deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it might have to do with things
like its stability as compared to Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some of the studies that have
grabbed products from the licensed market,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as our general awareness of
products in the unlicensed market,
[SPEAKER_00]: we find that some people will fail drug
tests because they've had Delta-8 with
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8-THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And folks think that, oh, it's got
Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have real cannabis in it,
if you will, these people will say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they think it's safe to use,
but yet they still fail drug tests for
[SPEAKER_00]: their trucking job or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you just explain briefly why
Delta-8 is not safe for animals?
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who have to take drug tests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as we said in the beginning,
the only difference is where this double
[SPEAKER_01]: bond is that makes a difference between
Delta-8 and Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in analytical assays for urine testing,
metabolites of THC, they're going to show
[SPEAKER_01]: up anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bottom line is if you're getting
urine testing for your job, don't use
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people who are looking
to defend Delta-8, you know, as it's
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially made right now as an
agricultural product, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they say, listen, it's an agricultural
product like anything else, and we should
[SPEAKER_00]: be allowed to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on your webinar the other day,
it was mentioned why, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8 doesn't make sense to consider it
an agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you repeat that analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it had its first origin in a
plant grown in the ground, presumably,
[SPEAKER_01]: although some Delta-8 may be made from
synthetic CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it gets into the lab and
subjected to these chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: transmogrifications, it's not natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a synthetic product and one that
invariably is contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a scientific threshold point
where a molecule that started out in a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is now considered a synthetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm figuring that somewhere along
that chain of synthesis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's officially no longer an agricultural
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that threshold exist or is that more
subjective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time you've changed one thing into
something else, that's no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had you on Shaping Fire before to
talk about cannabinoid hyperemesis
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the likelihood that someone
will be especially sensitive to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: causing a whole range of negative
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we seen cannabinoid hyperemesis
syndrome from being caused by Delta-8
[SPEAKER_00]: products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2021, there was a case report.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a woman who'd had prior gastric
surgery and came in with nausea and
[SPEAKER_01]: vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she got a CAT scan to make sure that
nothing was wrong with the surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her nausea and vomiting wasn't
responding to the usual approaches and
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs that they used.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turned out she'd been using Delta-8 THC
gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They suspected she had cannabinoid
hyperemesis syndrome and then responded to
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs that seemed to work better there,
specifically haloperidol, which is a major
[SPEAKER_01]: tranquilizer, and capsaicin ointment on
the skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome will
be caused by anything, whether Delta-9,
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta-8, or synthetic cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoids that are stimulating the CB1
receptor, the main psychoactive receptor
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, Delta-8 can be associated with
CHS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we wrap up here at the end of set
three, I think I want to wrap up by
[SPEAKER_00]: reading a couple of quotes from the C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hudala study from 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: May 21, we believe in unicorns and Delta-8
from the cannabis scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to ask you a question
and we'll wrap up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are a couple of quotes from that
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is not with Delta-8,
but the unregulated distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic contaminated products.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least Walter White was a chemistry
teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8 has become a money printing
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I show producers what it is in
their sample, they don't stop making it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't stop distributing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just go to another lab who will not
acknowledge the contaminants found.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really points to, oh, so I'm no
longer quoting anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my voice now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really points to the shysteen nature
of a particular section of the unlicensed
[SPEAKER_00]: market, but even some of the licensed
market because we know Delta-8 has snuck
[SPEAKER_00]: into state level legal markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's finish with this, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're very passionate about this
as a medical doctor and also as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher in search for the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: For folks that are making these Delta-8
products that we know are all coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis from CBD, what message would you
have for them in encouragement to perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: reconsider their approach?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I would state that there's nothing
that Delta-8 does that can't be done more
[SPEAKER_01]: safely and effectively with a natural
cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that may not be available to everyone,
but I hope that the laws will change and
[SPEAKER_01]: that we see this commerce in Delta-8
disappear because, to repeat what I said
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, Delta-8 craze is a byproduct of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, this problem sits at the
feet of our legislators who are choosing
[SPEAKER_00]: to drag their feet instead of taking real
legalization action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a pleasure to have you on
Shaping Fire and especially with such a
[SPEAKER_00]: nuanced topic as this that is just not
getting enough attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you taking your time and your
expertise and going through it with us so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we too, as cannabis enthusiasts,
can understand the nuances and use it in
[SPEAKER_00]: our own lives as well as the people who we
care for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friends, if you are interested in
learning more about Dr. Russo,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a few ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, I highly recommend you
check out Ethan Russo's library of work
[SPEAKER_00]: and research at ethanrusso.org and then
click on the library tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also find a link to this on the
shapingfire.com website for today's
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also learn about Ethan Russo's
work bringing cannabis into legal and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthful cannabis products and different
projects at credo-science.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's C-R-E-D-O-science.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, if you have a burning
question or a comment that is only going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be for Ethan Russo, you can email him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, be realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Ethan, for all these years,
he does his best to get back with
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, but he is, you know,
still an active researcher and he's flying
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world to give lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might take him a while to get back
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think he does a pretty good job of
getting back with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, if you want to learn more from
Dr. Russo, he has joined us several times
[SPEAKER_00]: on shapingfire over the last five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps one of these will interest
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way back five years ago,
episode 22 on treating traumatic brain
[SPEAKER_00]: injury with cannabis and psilocybin
mushrooms.
