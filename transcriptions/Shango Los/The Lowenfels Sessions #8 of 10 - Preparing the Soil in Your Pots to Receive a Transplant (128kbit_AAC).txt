[SPEAKER_02]: Every year, farmers everywhere are
preparing their soil for the new season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a key part of this soil is everybody
wants these complex mycelial networks
[SPEAKER_02]: because these fungal networks move around
nutrients and communication and they
[SPEAKER_02]: create a thriving soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why people are so into
no-till, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you go from season to season and
this web, if you will, stays consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: from season to season.
[SPEAKER_02]: But lots of folks have got to move into
new soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either they're expanding their grow or
there's something wrong with the old soil
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're going to transplant cannabis
into one of these pots, you want to have
[SPEAKER_02]: some kind of maturity in the pot already
so that you can end up with by the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: your cannabis cycle, that's when the soil
is actually good, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's going to take the whole life
of the cannabis plant for the mycelial
[SPEAKER_02]: networks to come into being.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you recommend could be done to
these pots before season so that by the
[SPEAKER_02]: time you're transplanting into these pots,
they're already mycelium rich and ready to
[SPEAKER_02]: rock?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go back first though and correct
the no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one reason we don't no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of other reasons,
not the least of which is that the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: soil food web, not just the mycorrhizal
network, gets messed up when you till up
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to say when you cut a worm in half,
you don't get two worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only one reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the mycorrhizal fungi are
concerned, they require a plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are no mycorrhizal fungi in
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I give advice, when I advise indoor
cannabis, people call me up and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, what are you charging, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My advice is always a stunner to them when
they find out that what they need to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: do what you're doing, start early,
get that soil conditioned, put a cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that cover crop to feed or to grow a
thriving mycelium network.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got about a month, month and a
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably enough time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly can't hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you put your plant in there,
it sends out signals to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal to come to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be mycorrhizal already growing,
which it can feed into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's key.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also take mycorrhizal fungal product and
I mix it in my soil so that as the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: grows during the season, the roots grow
into mycorrhizal fungi and are able to
[SPEAKER_01]: establish new colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you end up with colonies on the new
roots as well as the old roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to add it to your soil when
you're putting your pots together.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, you want to keep that
phosphorus in particular, but nitrogen as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those numbers need to be low or the
mycorrhizal fungi will never grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then put in something so that you get
a signal from a plant that activates the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the spark of light that gets
things going.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's definitely the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they named it after a plant stigma
or something or other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant definitely sends the signal
out to the fungi and says, come hither.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the plant doesn't do that,
the mycorrhizal fungi has no idea that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is there.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The network then becomes a wonderful
feeding network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, maybe we should just spend a little
teeny bit of time talking about why do
[SPEAKER_01]: people use new soil all the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: It tends to be a knee-jerk reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, when I advise growers, particularly
indoor growers, because that's people who
[SPEAKER_01]: come to me more often than outdoor
growers, they're dumbfounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, don't throw that soil out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with a male plant, don't throw that
soil out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chances are when you think about it,
you realize, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing that's wrong with that soil has
been used once before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might need a little bit of nutrient in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that plant that I had in it before
sent out exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in that soil already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably brought in the microbes that I
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in that soil already.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are root tunnel passages that the
new plant can utilize and grow with much
[SPEAKER_01]: less effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's organic material left by those old
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old rhizosphere is still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy, all this stuff is valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really think hard and long about
whether you want to use new soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is amazing to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, particularly these large commercial
indoor growers that I advise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, we saved a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, is it a huge savings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you end up with better soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year was my first year to
experiment with cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does make a huge difference,
especially in keeping the soil pleasantly
[SPEAKER_02]: moist and with the structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also realized that there's a lot of
variability in cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it grows more than you want it to
do and gets me a hassle.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you recommend as being a good,
easy cover crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the red clovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on where you live, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do in Anchorage, Alaska has got
to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different than what you do down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it clover the same everywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, there are other stuff that
people add to it.
Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, in some places it really grows
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Anchorage, it grows nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're not careful, the seedling
can get inundated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you get that plant up and
running, then it doesn't matter what you
[SPEAKER_01]: have in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But oh my gosh, it's fun to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a living mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in many ways, it takes care of that
mulching problem you have, particularly as
[SPEAKER_01]: they die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And start feeding stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you encourage, you said as they die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that some folks, when they get
certain height, they just go ahead and
[SPEAKER_02]: scissor and cut them through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's laborious, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for big rows, but for homegrown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think that's worthwhile at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just ignore it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let them die on their own?
[SPEAKER_01]: I let them die on their own sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it depends on where I am,
when I'm traveling and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, we do a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it just pays not to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too much work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question on the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the common opinions against
cover crop is that that cover crop is
[SPEAKER_02]: stealing my nutrients for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that cover crop should be putting
nutrients in the soil for your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's stealing nutrients for your
plant, you're using the wrong cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be making nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we use nitrogen fixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you use those nitrogen fixings with
mycorrhizal fungi, you get increased
[SPEAKER_01]: nodules.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to use the right stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's probably based on a
misunderstanding of just thinking that,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, the plant is growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, it's a zero sum competition
between the cannabis plant and the cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just false.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's false.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's completely false.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're getting soil structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend who did the landscape,
the re-landscaping for the St. Louis arch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got there, and the soil was
terrible, and it was compacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the fall, he planted long
turnips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the people of St. Louis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our national model.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting turnips next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, he made that soil into the finest,
greatest stuff in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover crops work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason people use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they make a great deal of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people might want to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I tell indoor growers,
this as well, sometimes you have a fallow
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just put the cover crop in,
and you don't put the cannabis in it for a
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You let it just spend half a season or a
season growing the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got to expand our thinking
about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're too fixated on the hydroponic model,
because that's what we all had back when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at the regenerative cannabis
conference a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Leighton Morrison was talking about
how he really likes radishes as a cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop, because I guess they've got a very
long taproot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the turnip concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was going to say, is that the same
idea, except at a more reasonable size for
[SPEAKER_02]: containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem I have with using radish
and turnips for cannabis is they are tend
[SPEAKER_01]: to be allopathic to microresin fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, that's kind of a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think you've got to pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to think back here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they are members of the Cole
family, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Radishes, cabbages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they in the same family?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody's going to think about
using radishes, double check on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, double check on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly don't want to use cabbages,
I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nothing in the Rossi affair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they are allopathic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if you plant in that
soil the next season, you get a tough time
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the microresin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
Thank you.
