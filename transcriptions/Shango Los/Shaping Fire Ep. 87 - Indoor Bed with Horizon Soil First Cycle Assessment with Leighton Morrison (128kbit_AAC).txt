[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivating cannabis under the sun has
been my preference during the last 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years, my first years cultivating
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my preference because I absolutely
believe that sun-grown cannabis has wider
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene and cannabinoid profiles,
thus making it excellent medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, I also know sun-grown is
leafier, and living where I live on Vashon
[SPEAKER_00]: Island in the Pacific Ocean and the
Pacific Northwest, plants rarely finish
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outdoor plants may be superior in many
ways philosophically, but in reality,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I live, anything that takes more
than 50 days to bloom doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who follow Shaping Fire,
you know that this is one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: I've become such a proponent and supporter
of auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that I can harvest them fully
flowered in warm, dry, and sunny
[SPEAKER_00]: September.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about a year ago, I decided I wanted to
try my hand at growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a struggle for me to decide because
I identify as a regeneratively-minded
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivator and struggled with the
idea of using electricity to power my
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, I decided to buy an
exceptionally environmentally-friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS LED light and went forward growing a
4x4 tent inside in hopes of growing my own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine with fully finished
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the little tent grow would also act as
a good demonstration to teach from on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram so I could help other patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to soil biologist Leighton
Morrison and asked him to guide me in
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up a horizon-style substrate,
as he outlined in Shaping Fire episode 54
[SPEAKER_00]: on geology and biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, sure, and off I went to try and
build an indoor raised bed using all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the regenerative and living soil
techniques I used every summer outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the voyages of the Shaping Fire
Living Soil Tent, its mission to explore
[SPEAKER_00]: strange soil biology, to seek out best
practices and fire flower, to boldly go
[SPEAKER_00]: where nature guides us.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today my returning guest is Leighton
Morrison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton is a lifelong enthusiast of both
aquaponics and living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: His obsession with biosphere too led him
to set up an aquaculture at the Rodale
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton worked with world renowned
biologist, Dr. Elaine Ingham, blending his
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaculture byproducts with compost and
worm castings to prove that natural inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: could replace synthetics in commercial
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton consults widely for agriculture,
soil regeneration, and commercial land
[SPEAKER_00]: management projects throughout the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton is currently founder of Kingdom
Aquaponics and invented their line of
[SPEAKER_00]: living compost and compost tea living soil
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton is a sought after speaker and
co-host of a weekly podcast on the future
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis project YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: One note, both Leighton and I lost loved
ones this week and this episode is a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: less jolly than most of the times that
we're together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we sound a bit off, that's why we're
sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: During today's episode, we will describe
in detail the first cycle of the Shaping
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire Horizon style indoor raised bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we will review how I
set up the substrate horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second set, we will discuss our
soil tests, the arrival of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: pests, and any risk of a perched water
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during the third set,
we'll talk about ground covers,
[SPEAKER_00]: scrogging, and growing mushrooms in the
substrate below the cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Shannon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a pleasure to come back and
chop it up with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, this is kind of a different
show, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, often when I have you
on the show to talk about something within
[SPEAKER_00]: your expertise, you know, I'm essentially
trying to draw out this academic and
[SPEAKER_00]: practiced information out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, you know, you're here because
you taught me, you know, this biomimicry
[SPEAKER_00]: style or what people are calling horizon
style growing technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured if I was going to do a show
where I kind of did a debrief of how my
[SPEAKER_00]: first cycle went, then might as well have
you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for both teaching me the
style and then coming back to help me tell
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody what I did wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for being a sacrificial
lamb today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I want to remind everybody
before we get going that the application
[SPEAKER_00]: of your strategy can look a lot of
different ways, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can plug in different soil
recipes into this model and it'll still
[SPEAKER_00]: work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get hung up on my own choices of
specific inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, like you can get
nitrogen a lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have had excellent success
over the years with dehydrated pig's
[SPEAKER_00]: blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be your preference,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get hung up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter like what your inputs
are to learn the substrate style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the division and the
percentages of clay, silt, sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that's the cornerstone of this
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like like during this first set,
you're going to hear what I use,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it may not be what you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so don't get too hung up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so let's start out by talking about how
your biomimicry horizon style played out
[SPEAKER_00]: in real terms for for my bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use a grassroots fabric pots four by
four raised bed in a four by four tent in
[SPEAKER_00]: in the shaping fire offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so what that gives me is an 18 inch
soil depth with about two or three inches
[SPEAKER_00]: of hardwood matter on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that hardwood matter
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so if you are working in a container
that's deeper than 18 inches, your numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be a little bit different
than mine, which is why we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you percentages of these different
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so when we go through this,
remember these numbers are based on my 18
[SPEAKER_00]: inch soil depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a grassroots fabric pots four by
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that said, there are there are
three layers in a horizon style bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top layer is the O horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next down is the A horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then under that is the E horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so if you take that 18 inches,
the in in in Leighton's style and by the
[SPEAKER_00]: point Leighton at any point, if I'm like
saying this wrong, feel free to correct
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you did say percentage and you
really shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should say fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, the horizontal soil system
is based on a seven part system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your E horizon is one seventh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your A horizon is two sevenths and your O
horizon is four sevenths.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the easy way to break it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever your depth is divided by seven
and and then, you know, use that as a
[SPEAKER_01]: method to building the proper depths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took that math and and Leighton and I
applied it to the 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that ends up with an O horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your top layer, your O horizon for my bed
is 10 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's all going to be organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, I chose to use no till soil
that from pots that I've been using the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few years and and and so it's it's
it's in quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quarter old soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quarter fish compost, a quarter pit
moss and a quarter alliance soil
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant, which which actually is a
product that that Leighton makes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is essentially a an incredibly
living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be a fair thing to call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's really just kind of organic
matter that has been infused with with
[SPEAKER_01]: fish biology and soil terrestrial biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just basically I make this very
biologically rich compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I strip it mechanically and add fish brew,
bold flow to it as I'm stripping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it once it comes out of the stripping
process and I screen it out to different
[SPEAKER_01]: coarseness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the alliance is a very coarse
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like a you know,
you'd fibrous compost, but it's incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: biologically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you want to get that from
Leighton, you can and it will certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: help get your bed going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But theoretically, if if you didn't want
to get something like that, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: double up on your, you know, your no till
soil you're bringing in from your outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: pots and then go with, you know,
half soil, a quarter fish compost and a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter pit moss, in my case, because I'm
not a big fan of using peat moss,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't I don't I don't see it as
being a renewable resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they destroy pit bogs to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So or peat bogs to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I'm very happy with the pit moss,
which is made out of organic paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my case, I've got a quarter my regen
soil, a quarter fish compost, a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: pit moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a quarter of this super infused stuff
from Leighton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get the growers grade or did you
get the cocoa complete?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the pit moss?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a few different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget actually the name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the stripped down stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this stuff without any added
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to control that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so those are the major components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and within that, I also put my
amendments, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The amendments, like the physical amount
of them is so small that it really doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: play a role in the overall recipe as far
as like like how the soil was built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding the nutrition, you know,
you could probably hold it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in four hands, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So but for me, I chose crushed oyster
shells, olly fish compost, dehydrated
[SPEAKER_00]: organic pig's blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, dynamico fungal inoculant,
pit moss, and then that supercharged
[SPEAKER_00]: supercharged soil inoculant from Leighton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so you take that and you mix that
all up and that becomes what but what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're calling here your organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so Leighton, do you like how I describe
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I think you described it
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's basically you're
building a soilless medium or a super
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because you're adding the
amendments, we would tend to call it a
[SPEAKER_01]: super soil over a soilless medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's you know, that's the bottom
line is you're you're you're still using a
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional style of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've also got those added benefits
of the horizon and a horizon to help
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigate moisture as well as provide sand,
silt and clay for the organic or for the
[SPEAKER_01]: biology to mine and provide nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you intend to call this a soilless
medium?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's half soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, the top the horizon is a
traditional soils medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But isn't half of that like soil,
like a quarter of it is my my no till soil
[SPEAKER_00]: from my pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another quarter of it is the
compost that you make isn't doesn't that
[SPEAKER_00]: count as soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always thought less is like coir
and peat and, you know, perlite and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff that actually isn't soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and, you know, I may have misspoke
because I don't really know what your no
[SPEAKER_01]: till soil pot was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, was it peat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was like it was just like
literally old soil that I got originally
[SPEAKER_00]: out of bags that was just like potting
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I used it for five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so it was it was like bad soil gone
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, yes, I would refer this to more
as a soil than a soil is medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although you do have soil as medium
components in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pit moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And compost because compost is not soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, it'll break down to soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in in the beginning parts of the
composting process, it's more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient rich material than it is per se a
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can you know, we don't we don't
need to get too crazy on the Finites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that's that's your top 10 inches in
when you're talking about an 18 inch bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so then your next layer down is
what's called your A horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when using Layton's sevenths model,
if you have an 18 inch bed, this next
[SPEAKER_00]: layer, this A horizon is five inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the A horizon is made up of 17 percent
clay, 13 percent silt, 50 percent sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last 20 percent is another
portion of the organic matter mix that you
[SPEAKER_00]: made for the O horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're making the the organic
matter for your O horizon, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make, you know, enough to fill up
the O horizon, plus some extra to go in
[SPEAKER_00]: the A horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then and then at the end
also, I threw in a splash of biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, biochar is so potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just like took a couple of
handfuls and throw it threw it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's it's such a small
component of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the crazy things about this is,
you know, since I was trying to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: bed as regenerative as possible,
with the obvious exception of the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was indoors, and I was using
electricity, I decided that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: wildcraft all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, wow, depending on where you live,
your mileage may vary trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clay was easy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, I live on an island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then along the outskirts of our
island, along the beaches, we have got all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of soil erosion that is going into,
you know, the saltwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so getting clay for me was really
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I just went down and there were big
hunks of beautiful clay that were just
[SPEAKER_00]: falling off the clay wall where you could
see all the all the layers of earth
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed from, you know, the ocean water
eroding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grabbing the clay was easy, heavy as hell,
but but easy to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the sand was certainly easy as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I live on an island, I could just
collect some sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're doing only doing a four by
four bed, you're hardly taking any,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's like a five gallon bucket,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard part for me was this damn silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I I understood from Layton that
I wanted to look for silt along running
[SPEAKER_00]: freshwater that was heading towards the
saltwater around the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I looked at I first I went to an
estuary on the island where the where the
[SPEAKER_00]: freshwater meets the saltwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grabbed a bunch of that and I took
it home and I gave it a shake test in a
[SPEAKER_00]: mason jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and the component of silt was very
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Layton, why don't you explain how to do a
mason jar shake test for people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: never done that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a home or an at home textural
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you fill a mason jar three
quarters full of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you add water till the water is just
above the top of the soil that you added
[SPEAKER_01]: while still leaving an air space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you seal the lid, shake it up,
set it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the course of two days,
what will happen is everything will settle
[SPEAKER_01]: and the water will go clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that water to be clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you will see the layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first layer, the sand will settle out
the fastest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, the silt will settle out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, the clay will settle out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually you'll get some organic matter
floating on the surface of the water or
[SPEAKER_01]: floating on just on top of the clay layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you basically get sands of clay and
organic matter ratios or percentages by
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did this and every time I took a
sample, it was like almost all clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hardly any silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so after I did that and was not
getting a high enough silt percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: where the the fresh water was meeting the
salt water at the estuary, I decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: work my way backwards up that stream
further up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, OK, maybe instead of doing
estuary, maybe I should take it from a
[SPEAKER_00]: long stream, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe maybe it'll be more silt there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I took another sample there,
brought it home, shook it up, let it sit
[SPEAKER_00]: for two days, looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was more silt, but still not
enough where I thought that I was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to like divide it off to be able
to get 13 percent silt in my A horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, damn, I still need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then so then I worked my way up even
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was planning on going up as far as a
freshwater pond that was up this stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I found was an elbow in the
stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it was not going straight downhill,
it came down and it kind of like jagged
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it continued down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that elbow, I found silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for whatever biomechanics reason,
that elbow held the silt better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other two places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I took it, you know, it still
wasn't like 80 percent silt like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping, but it was like 50 percent silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like way, way better than
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: else I had gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, fine, we're just going to
call this good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because, you know, it's always good to
remember that this while while we have
[SPEAKER_00]: goals, we have we have benchmarks for what
we're trying to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't hit the benchmarks with what
you have available locally, just frickin
[SPEAKER_00]: go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so that's where I harvested,
you know, just a little bit of silt
[SPEAKER_00]: because, again, this is only a four by
four bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grabbed it and and then added that
as my 13 percent silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess technically in my math,
since I was using material that was only
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 percent silt as my 13 percent silt,
I probably only have seven percent silt in
[SPEAKER_00]: my bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for better, for worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I didn't I wasn't sure how
to make up for that silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think I did this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I actually tried to make up for some
of the silt by adding some volcanic
[SPEAKER_00]: Akadama clay from Japan that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not recommending you do that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because bringing bringing clay from Japan
for this is like so environmentally a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I happen to already have the stuff
from when I was doing aquariums back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, hey, this is a good use for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I put that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so before we go on, is there any way
that that makes sense, Leighton,
[SPEAKER_00]: using Akadama volcanic clay as a
replacement for silt or is that just like
[SPEAKER_00]: totally wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know, there's a technical
challenge to making a definitive
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between silt and clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to stick along the lines of that
silt is organic matter broken down about
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as it can without specialty
bacteria to break it down further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clay is more like ground up rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or ash from a volcano.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bottom line is, though, they're the
very, very fine, small particles that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been pretty much broken down as much as
they can through natural processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than these really finite,
special bacteria that can continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: break them down further and make them,
again, plant available so that the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: can uptake those minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the plant dies, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes back to silt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets really complicated at that
microscopic level of what is a clay
[SPEAKER_01]: platelet?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a silt particle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditional soil science has always
measured these by particle size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, you know, again,
kind of archaic in this day and age where
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that the clay platelets are both
positive and negatively charged so that
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of the clay platelet is positively
charged and the outer rim, think of it as
[SPEAKER_01]: a flying saucer, the outer rim is
negatively charged.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the negatively charged rim pulls
positively charged cations and stores
[SPEAKER_01]: them, so these are nutrients, around the
outside perimeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So silt doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silt is generally negatively charged.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not have a positive aspect,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sand has no charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we define these as through
particle size and not through
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics of perhaps both weight and
also the ability to hold certain
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I think that soil science has
got to kind of come up to speed with what
[SPEAKER_01]: we know as far as some of these more
advanced understandings of these
[SPEAKER_01]: materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds to me that even though I used
that volcanic Akadama clay, like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: cute and that filled up the place,
but it really wasn't a silt replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just something else that probably
helped the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you did your silt test, what was the
other component?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it clay or was it sand?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so here again, you know,
you can use that combination to
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding that, okay, of this material
I collected in the stream, 50% of it was
[SPEAKER_01]: sand, 50% of it was silt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I just use more of that and don't
add any sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see where I'm going with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, you know, again, you have to do
a little bit of math and apply some common
[SPEAKER_01]: sense, but you can get pretty close to
these ratios, especially if you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: this textual at-home test method to
determine exactly what your inputs are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just kind of play with them a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I used the ratio 17 clay,
13 silt based on their properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're off on your ratios,
it's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you know, your goal is to try
to get as close as you can to that for
[SPEAKER_01]: biological processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you're allowing the specific
biology that breaks clay down,
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't break silt down and vice
versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just providing all of these
inputs for really getting that advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: level of living biology to have all of the
potential tools and methods to function at
[SPEAKER_01]: high level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, we haven't even
started talking about fungi because they
[SPEAKER_01]: also are really important in breaking
those things down and pulling out
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients as well as, you know,
providing biofilm to actually make
[SPEAKER_01]: aggregates out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll get into that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last thing that's in this A horizon
is like that splash of biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put in three handfuls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there a reason why the biochar goes
in the A horizon instead of in the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the O horizon?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it can go in either place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, I would probably be more
thrilled to throw it into the O horizon so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's really going to be like a little
condominium for biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: To set up shop in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the A horizon, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the roots are going to get down
into the A anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I encourage people too to
get real creative with their horizons.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason why you can't put some
old hay or some leaves that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: collected or some forest stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's again, diversity,
diversity, diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that forest stuff is going to be
biologically active with local microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's always an extra extra
win.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so so so far we've got the first top
10 inches is the O horizon of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next down is the A horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is five inches, which is the clay,
silt, sand and a little bit more organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the bottom of the bed,
the last three inches is the E horizon,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is sand and rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, you could use bagged
sand if, you know, if you live in a urban
[SPEAKER_00]: environment or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky that I just happened to live on
an island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sand is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I loved the idea that it came
already living with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: water based IMOs that also were oxygen
tolerant since the the the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tide goes up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grabbed a bit of sand from the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so so Leighton, why don't you
explain why you recommend the rocks should
[SPEAKER_00]: be multicolored?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, every color indicates a level of
mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the different colors represent
different parts of the periodic table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more colors you get, the more
variety of those minerals are available
[SPEAKER_01]: for the mycorrhizae to mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, something else that you
said about bagged sand, just be careful
[SPEAKER_01]: not to get play sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want the white fluffy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want coarse that should be taupe color
or yellowish or brownish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the type of sand you want,
not the white powdery stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that white powdery stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more like over processed,
like white flour, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want you want chewy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I encourage everybody to take a
five gallon bucket and fill it half full
[SPEAKER_01]: of sand and then take measurable gallons
of water and dump it into that bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: until you see the water just going over
the top of the sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then look at how many jugs you used.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be blown away at how much water
coarse sand can actually hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so so Leighton explaining to me why
having multicolored rocks started me on a
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult process, because I was down
on the beach and I was token and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at all the colors of all the
different rocks on the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know, I can I can
collect the rocks and I'll have like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 15 different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the the best bed ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so I started collecting these
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then, you know, Leighton had told
me that if you can break the rocks open,
[SPEAKER_00]: like crack the rocks, because if you're if
you're wild crafting rocks, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten smooth on the outside and they
don't leach their minerals very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very conveniently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's all like, you know,
if you can hit it with a hammer and break
[SPEAKER_00]: it open, you'll have the raw interior so
that the minerals can be extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was all excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I started collecting rocks and then
I put them in a burlap bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I took my sledgehammer to it to
break them open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, oh, that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I poured those into a five gallon
bucket and then I grabbed another bag of
[SPEAKER_00]: burlap bag full and I hit that with a
sledgehammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did that for like an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got totally exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, all right, I got my damn
rocks and I bring them in the house and I
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like this little dribbling
in the corner of this big ass bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, shit, I have to do three
inches of the whole bed of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, I do not have the
strength and the time and the life and the
[SPEAKER_00]: muscles for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I what I decided to do is I
did that process like four more times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that let's say like maybe an inch of
the three inches was hand wild crafted and
[SPEAKER_00]: hand broken up rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then I went to the the
landscaping store and I bought like I
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly don't know what the rock is
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was it's just they're like straight
up gray drainage rock that they use for
[SPEAKER_00]: landscaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just poured bags of that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say this so you can laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but also to realize that, you know,
we can only do what we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I realized how much physical
labor that was going to be, I just decided
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know what, having some natural
rocks from the wild environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what, I'm going to have to
finish the fill with what I can just go
[SPEAKER_00]: buy and dump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just figured it was worthwhile
because if if you are going to try to wild
[SPEAKER_00]: craft your inputs, you're bound to run
into something that's hard to find where
[SPEAKER_00]: you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just don't stress about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just just grab some stuff and move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no such thing as perfection in
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't try to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really exciting when you get to
this next part and you and you get to put
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in the process, it was kind
of like, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're if you're having a chef night
and you're making something special at
[SPEAKER_00]: home, you can use the French strategy of
mise en place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you where you get all your
ingredients, you cut everything up and you
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in like little ramekins there on
your counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once all your ingredients are
set, then you go and you make your meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of mise en place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for like soil science, I went ahead
and I collected everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got everything ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the day came that I made the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I want to put in here something that
I did not realize I should have had until
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have this in my bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after I made the bed, Layton's all
like, oh, you should put a four inch PVC
[SPEAKER_00]: tube along one of the corners so you can
see how much water is in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not digging that corner back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but but if I were to do this again,
I would do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so Layton, would you explain in
retrospect why, you know, you recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you couldn't get your hand down
between the liner and the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no way for you to see other
than if you overflow, because you did put
[SPEAKER_01]: a liner underneath there, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the rubber liner serves as a way to
prevent any excess moisture from leaking
[SPEAKER_01]: out around the bottom of your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, with the grassroot pots,
they fit perfectly in a four by four tent
[SPEAKER_01]: with no room for you to get your hand
between the liner, the pot itself and the
[SPEAKER_01]: tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I would suggest it to you
to set that piece of pipe because and it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't even have to be four inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be one inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you basically take two styrofoam balls
and a dowel and you drop that styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you take a styrofoam ball,
put put the dowel into it so that the ball
[SPEAKER_01]: stays on it and then take the other one
and slide it down till it's about eight or
[SPEAKER_01]: ten inches above the bottom one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just drop that whole thing
right into the tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you water that little dowel is
going to come up and you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to determine exactly how much water
is being stored in your e-horizon and and
[SPEAKER_01]: never flooded because you actually know,
oh, shit, I've added 20 gallons to this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not leaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's my level?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll say, oh, wow, my level's at two
and a half inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives you a way to monitor just how
much water is actually being stored in
[SPEAKER_01]: your e or your aquifer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's basically what you created
is aquifer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do recommend that you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll use that next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm at the point now that the only time
that I can really check how much water is
[SPEAKER_00]: in my e-horizon is when I go to take a
soil test and I dig in deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go dig in extra deep all the way
down to my e-horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put my hand there and see how much
water is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that is not efficient at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, you know, testing my water,
checking my water table once at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of a run and once at the end of
a run and twice a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's worked out for me so far,
but I do wish that I had that that that
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical tube just stuck in one of the
corners so I could check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OK, so so here we are at the end of set
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gone through an explanation of the
o-horizon, the a-horizon, the e-horizon,
[SPEAKER_00]: both what I did and more how to think
about it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is kind of an algorithm and,
you know, what you choose to use will vary
[SPEAKER_00]: and the size of your bed is going to be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your how much you need to make to fill
up your sevenths is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more we're just trying to make sure
you understand the idea behind it so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can play out this algorithm for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Leighton, anything else you want to
add to this before we go to break?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think you covered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, it's all about
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, colors are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Textures are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using your local resources is very
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have to buy something, you have to
buy something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you know, you're looking for if
you're buying sand, you want very coarse
[SPEAKER_01]: sand, so like masonry sand, you know,
as far as, you know, the rocks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: One piece I do want to really kind of
reiterate is that when you're when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting those rocks in there, you don't
have to fill all two and a half to three
[SPEAKER_01]: inches in rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be, you know, one third rock and
the rest can be sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But make sure you wash the sand down into
the rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to have any voids
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have voids, then organic matter is
going to get down in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to go anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the horizon really functions as a
what's called sand filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a sand filter is is generally used in,
you know, golf courses to move groundwater
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can also be used in zoos to separate
water that has a lot of duck manure in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's a it's a technique that
prevents organic matter or fine
[SPEAKER_01]: particulate from getting down into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're basically separating fine
particulate from water itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the beauty of the is that it
acts as a as a sand filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're interested in sand filters,
I encourage you to go back to the shaping
[SPEAKER_00]: fire episode with Steven Reisner about the
water food web and how to use aquaponics
[SPEAKER_00]: with living soil systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about that a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, and Leighton, I wish you would
have told me I didn't have to have three
[SPEAKER_00]: inches of all rocks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I missed that in my notes when we
originally talked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all a learning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we're going to take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is soil biologist
Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options and who to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_00]: ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend HEMBRA genetics collection to my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and listeners who are looking for
a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HEMBRA spelled H-E-M-B-R-A.

[SPEAKER_00]: Our clients make the planet better.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Lose, and my guest
today is soil biologist, Leighton
[SPEAKER_00]: Morrison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first set, we talked about how
the horizons are actually set up and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: In set two, we're gonna start talking
about how this soil act, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: attributes that it showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right off the bat, the first attribute
that it showed was fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's funny, there's a bro science
thing that is actually pretty good in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of cases, which is don't bring your
soil from outdoors indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you bring in outdoor soil
indoors, you are bringing in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're bringing in potential pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all bringing in allies,
predator allies as well, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in just a lot of variables
because you don't know what's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really wanted to use my aged no-till
soil that I've been using in my pots and
[SPEAKER_00]: amending for the last five or six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This soil is just absolutely frickin'
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was clear that I was going to bring
outdoor soil indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I told that to a lot of my my
peers, they're like, oh, that's so
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that it is dangerous,
but I was willing to go for it because I
[SPEAKER_00]: really wanted the living biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So brought in the soil, made the horizon,
put it on the bed, and then turned on my
[SPEAKER_00]: super sexy BIOS lighting LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, it took about 24 hours for there
to just be a sea of fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was a concern to see
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also didn't freak the hell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have cannabis plants in there
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expected things to get really excited
when I took them from a cold outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment because this was, you know,
during the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of this stuff had already gone to
sleep or cyst it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I suddenly put it in a warm,
full spectrum, 18 hours of light
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, like everything hatched.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bugs hatched their eggs or
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had all of these fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, OK, breathe and let's
call Copert, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is where I get my beneficial
insects from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I called my Copert rep and then I said,
all right, I've got fungus gnats and a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole hell of a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you send me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after asking me a bunch of
questions and stuff, they decided on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Stratiolalops scimitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who actually know the
correct pronunciation, you probably know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I butchered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, generally, you know what I
mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these Stratiolalops scimitis,
they sent me a container of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of how the holidays laid,
by the time I asked them that that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed, it was going to take them 10
days to get it to me because they ship out
[SPEAKER_00]: once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, all right, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send me that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the meantime, I called my buddy
Layton to bitch about this and complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, dude, you know,
I've got all of these these fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why don't you pick up the storyline
here, Layton?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you tell me to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it was really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You called me and was like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, hey, do you still have that
rejuvenate I sent you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it any good?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, did it dry out?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, let me go check.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came back and said, no,
it's still still moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, all right, just whip it up a tea
and pour it across the surface as evenly
[SPEAKER_01]: as you possibly can and watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the rejuvenate?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the rejuvenate?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's another one of the products
that I make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just basically like an instant
compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very fine particulate that when
you add the water just makes the water
[SPEAKER_01]: look, you know, dirty like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of turbidity in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a simple, easy way to
instantly make a very biologically diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: tea for situations like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you called me back and said,
what is this sorcery that you did?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is true because like I took I took the
rejuvenate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shook it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I evenly applied it across the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not 36 hours later, there wasn't a
single fungus gnat.
[SPEAKER_00]: None.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went from having like all the fungus
gnats in the world to having none of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually did say, what is this
sorcery?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because something had changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first, I thought that perhaps there
was something caustic in it somehow to
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had done something to the fungus
gnats, like some kind of pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why did all the fungus gnats actually
go away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you created a very aggressive
environment that they became a food source
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, in that rejuve,
you're going to have all different types
[SPEAKER_01]: of nematodes, which is probably the best
way to eradicate fungus gnats,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the little predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although they do help, the nematodes will
work right in the soil and just eat the
[SPEAKER_01]: eggs as fast as they can lay them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another little trick that if you
can get really good biocomplete or
[SPEAKER_01]: biologically rich compost and you make a
tea, you're going to create a much more
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced environment where one thing can't
outrun the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Leighton, you know, I love your
products, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, not everybody is
going to want to contact you and get your
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ask this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the secret to it to just have really
well-finished, biologically active compost
[SPEAKER_00]: and then make an un-aerated compost tea
extract?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that work in most cases, even if it's
not your product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes back to how to make compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of recipes out there,
but I like the real simple approach,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is basically collect greens and
browns off your own property.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't add manures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't hit temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it goes, if it hits 115, I flip it
because anytime you get over 120,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're losing biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hit 130, you are in what's called a
thermophilic process.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, everything is getting
cooked off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get to that level,
it's going to take a year, if not two,
[SPEAKER_01]: for all that biology to naturally come
back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a quick way to do this is to never let
it get over 115.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fine, as long as you're just
using plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start playing with manures,
you're going to have problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, I make vegan compost,
collecting, you know, one-third greens,
[SPEAKER_01]: two-thirds browns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I make the browns and greens as
diverse as I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, in the greens, you're looking
for endophytic biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So biology lives inside the tissue of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know for sure that that biology can
come out of that plant and into your
[SPEAKER_01]: compost pile if you put enough of them in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you're looking for diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm picking little green shoots off all
the plants that I can find and all
[SPEAKER_01]: different types and flowers and shrubs and
you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the browns is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for different types of wood
chips, different types of brown leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of dead stalks of plants,
and using all of that to make this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just a matter of soaking it
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, apply as much water as you possibly
can until it's just running out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then put a thermometer in it and
watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually within 24 hours, if you've blended
the greens and browns appropriate,
[SPEAKER_01]: within 24, 48 hours, you're going to see
it heat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do that, and then it goes to
say 115 and then starts to cool off,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you got to do is take that stuff,
put it in a compound five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: with a low speed drill, like a plaster or
paint mixer, and just throw a gallon of
[SPEAKER_01]: the compost in there, fill the rest half
full of water, and then blend it and then
[SPEAKER_01]: pour it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've just released all that biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a trick for you to make your
own inoculant at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus, gnat, larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their life cycle is very short.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it took a very short period of time
for all of those little hungry
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiologies in the compost to go and
eat the next couple generations of fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And zim zam, that's it, sorcery.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thanks for explaining that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that, you know, a lot of
times when I ask you questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm setting you up stuff that I actually
understand, you know, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm asking you the question, but I'm kind
of asking it for the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that I'm going to be asking
for me too, because I actually don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: your answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we explained this whole process,
the philosophy behind it in the biomimicry
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping fire episode number 54,
and then with all of the companion
[SPEAKER_00]: materials that I was posting to Instagram
of my own bed, some folks were commenting
[SPEAKER_00]: some concern that this was not going to
work right, that this was going to end up
[SPEAKER_00]: in a perched water table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was interesting because like,
you know, some of the angry boys were all
[SPEAKER_00]: getting themselves all bent out of shape
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas other people were having like,
you know, adult conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, when I came back to you
and I said, dude, you know, people are
[SPEAKER_00]: arguing on Instagram about this perched
water table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is this going to be a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, no, no, no, no,
no, this is a misunderstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you explained it to me,
and I still do not understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to hearing you
explain it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those people who were A,
either concerned about creating a perched
[SPEAKER_00]: water table or B, people who want to give
this a try and their friends may give them
[SPEAKER_00]: hassle about a perched water table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you go through it in simple terms so
that we can all understand why this does
[SPEAKER_00]: not apply to this particular horizon style
growing system that you've shared with us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it was in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil engineers were trying to figure out
what the best way to build a high
[SPEAKER_01]: performance sports turf for both,
you know, football, baseball, golf,
[SPEAKER_01]: you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually created the perched
water table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it was was basically they put a
liner down and put a layer of gravel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, compacted sand
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they rolled out their sod.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason they did this was because they
wanted to have a surface like a putting
[SPEAKER_01]: green that you could walk across,
but you could still roll a ball perfectly
[SPEAKER_01]: without having it bounce all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also you needed to be able to walk
across this in case of a heavy rain event
[SPEAKER_01]: without it turning to muck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's very, very little organic
matter and hardly any silt or clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: In these types of high performance sports
turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not a lot of ability to store
water or to and an ability to get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: it just as fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes back to that filling a bucket
up with sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I encourage people to do that
and notice how much water comes in that it
[SPEAKER_01]: holds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other side of this, if you take
the bucket and cut the bottom out and then
[SPEAKER_01]: put it directly on soil and then fill that
bucket half full of sand and then add
[SPEAKER_01]: water, come back a couple of days later
and that sand is still wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it shows you how much capillary action,
wicking that the sand can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somewhere along the line, some
horticulturist or I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant gardener was talking about whether
to put gravel or shards of clay in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of their pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somehow confused the perched water
table with what happens in soilless
[SPEAKER_01]: mediums or potting mixes in that
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes back to why I came up with
the horizontal system for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry in the first place was because
when you're using a potting mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom is going to go anaerobic and
the top is going to be hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's a low tension soil,
the capillary action and the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: wick is not really there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the misnomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem is that again,
somewhere along the line, somebody said,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, well, if I throw gravel in the bottom
of my pod, that'll help me from getting
[SPEAKER_01]: this anaerobic environment and use the
word perched water table.
[SPEAKER_01]: When perched water table has nothing to do
with potting soil, it's really talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about how to make a high performance
sports turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, so when you're comparing a pot
full of potting mix to a horizontal soil
[SPEAKER_01]: system, that's like looking at a tomato
versus a cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not even close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, do your homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really read up on where perched water
tables come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not from the horticultural industry
or the gardening industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just somewhere someone along the
line took one term and applied it to
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask you about the, you said that
when people don't use an e-horizon at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom with sand and rocks and they're
using top to bottom, a soil blend of some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort, that the bottom of the container is
going to go anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is the idea that the reason why it's
going to go anaerobic is because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially got a pot that's entirely
o-horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't o, a, and e-horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just o-horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you water it, the water will
go through and certainly there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: some mobility of water, but really that
water is going to collect at the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: just like it does in any biology with a
water table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since you've got sitting water in
organic matter, it just kind of rots,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why since we know this is how
water performs in a horizon style living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil container, we put sand and rocks at
the bottom because they can hold the water
[SPEAKER_00]: from your watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can hold the water without rotting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the right idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the a-horizon will help because it's
not low tension.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually high tension soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will help to pull the water out of the
horizon and move it up into the o-horizon
[SPEAKER_01]: as the top dries out and pulls the water
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so will you talk a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you talk a little bit about water
mobility?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this at length in the
water and watering episode we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the idea of how to water your plants
and how to understand how water moves
[SPEAKER_00]: around in the container, if you're like
really nerding out about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: go back to the Shaping Fire episode with
Layton called Water and Watering because
[SPEAKER_00]: we go at this for like a half hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those of us who are just
interested in indoor growing and hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: this debrief on this regenerative tent,
please continue Layton.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water does a couple of things,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you look at your soilless medium,
your compost your peat or pit or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: you're adding in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to get what's called
fines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fines are really small particulate that
when the water hits them, the water will
[SPEAKER_01]: actually move them down in the pot due to
gravitational forces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as all those fines move down to the
bottom of the pot, you end up making a
[SPEAKER_01]: swamp at the bottom of your pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now all of that water is being held by
the those fines because they are high
[SPEAKER_01]: tension, whereas the rest of the fibers
are more low tension.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore you have more aeration,
you have the ability for roots to really
[SPEAKER_01]: push through that stuff very easily,
which is why that's used to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that was traditionally used.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still is used to grow cannabis to this
day because it has that ability for if you
[SPEAKER_01]: feed the plant, the roots are going to go
crazy, easily expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously you're going to see the
effect at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where the plant comes out of the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, that's why these
soilless mediums or super soils will have
[SPEAKER_01]: that issue is that as you water you moving
all the fines to the bottom where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to collect and compact and store
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with the horizontal system,
your sand filter will prevent any fines
[SPEAKER_01]: from getting down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your fines do move down from your
horizon, they're just going to naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: blend in with the A horizon because it too
is preventing that easy ability for those
[SPEAKER_01]: fines to migrate through the soil system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always been an issue in engineering
soils, which I used to do quite a bit of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I still do, was preventing that fines from
moving down and collecting and then
[SPEAKER_01]: creating what would be considered an
impervious surface or layer where the
[SPEAKER_01]: water can no longer move down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to start moving laterally or
horizontally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that again is causing all kinds
of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really want everything to just move
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that's why this system works so
well is because it functions both in
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to store water, prevent it from
going anaerobic while preventing the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall soil system from collapsing or
causing these layers to build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving right along, let's move to start
talking about soil tests now, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grab your soil test there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a couple of things to say before
we move into this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about soil tests
for about, I don't know, the next 10
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes or so, probably end up being 15,
but this is going to be the last thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that we talk about here in set two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we start talking about the soil
tests and your eyes start to glaze over
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't just leave the show because set
three is really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set three, we're going to be talking about
cover crops, how often water, scrogging,
[SPEAKER_00]: and mushrooms and companion plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So third set is going to be really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people just are not
interested with the details from a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we are about to lose you,
don't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just skip ahead to set three and start
listening again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for those of you who are interested
in the soil tests, this is what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see the soil test that
Leighton and I are talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find it on the page for this
episode at shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could hit pause right now and
go get that and then play along with us at
[SPEAKER_00]: home, or you can look at it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to be clear, we're not going to
go way in depth into the soil report.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a show about soil reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Leighton is going to give his overview
of it and mention what stands out for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to kind of do this like
cursory thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of this is for us to not only
encourage you to get soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are who I have used.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not a sponsor of the show and I
don't get any money from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just who Leighton recommended back
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use them and they've been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, if you're looking for a lab,
Logan Labs is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is all to inform a discussion
we're going to have about the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: soil test and the ending soil test and how
to compare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that and with the soil report in
hand, Leighton, you've got it in your hand
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're looking at the column that's
labeled start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is a test of is the test of
the bed after I built it and after I had
[SPEAKER_00]: been watering it for three weeks just by
itself so that everything, the biology
[SPEAKER_00]: could start to get accustomed to this,
you know, being indoors, being in a
[SPEAKER_00]: horizon level, you know, being under
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why don't you explain to us what
you see in soil test one, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the before I grew cannabis in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually what I'll do is I'll start with
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're six, four.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a big issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll bounce up to total exchange
capacity, which we would call CEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you're in the high 20s or mid 20s,
which is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we bounce down to organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a very high organic matter
content, 40.42%, which is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll start looking down at what's
called your trace elements, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything seems to be pretty much in
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your iron's a little high, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luminum's a little high, but again,
that's not going to be a problem unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you get into a low pH situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at your nitrates, 356.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means there's a tremendous amount of
natural organic N available in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that the biology can break down and
release as a plant food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those all look pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll bounce over to what's called the
saturated pace test, which is probably one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the most important aspects of looking
at a soil and its ability to function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look down under percent,
you'll see calcium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, and sodium, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally speaking, that ratio should
be calcium 75, magnesium 17, potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: eight, sodium zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, you have low calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your magnesium is way too high and your
potassium is a little hot, but look at
[SPEAKER_01]: your sodium, 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're losing a lot of potential
because that sodium is stuck on that
[SPEAKER_01]: cation exchange site instead of those
primary minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can talk a little bit more about
where to get some of these wonderful new
[SPEAKER_01]: organic products that are basically 4%
calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have calcium and you add it,
you will bump potassium and sodium off the
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium is what we call a double bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has two positive charges and
potassium and sodium only have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium has two as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be careful about Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to say, I'm like, it's so
funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're telling me I need to bump my
calcium in my magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh Jesus, is the actual solution
to this more Cal Mag?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we all know that is the joke,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, more Cal Bell, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody in the cannabis industry laughs
about that because that was what people
[SPEAKER_01]: did was they just pounded it with freaking
Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, if you put any more
magnesium on here, you're going to cause
[SPEAKER_01]: way more problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really just want pure calcium and
then you're going to let the plant work
[SPEAKER_01]: through the high magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the end of the run, you'll see that
that magnesium came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came down a little bit and your calcium
actually went up in end of one report.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so those are the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then underneath the percent,
I'm again looking at trace minerals,
[SPEAKER_01]: trace elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trace elements are really, really
important for some of the finite plant
[SPEAKER_01]: processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So its ability to fight disease,
to accept sunlight, the ability to push
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen and calcium through its whole
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malibdium is one of those really,
really important ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, looking at the start,
everything looked okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see anything that really jumps out
and scares me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toward the end of the run, all of a sudden
now we've lost a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll talk about that a little bit more
as things go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, let's move right to that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at the start and so I
had a pretty good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you had a great start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a nice variety of nutrients and I
was really happy with all the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then a goal and I do the run,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew five plants in that tent,
which we'll talk more about in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I grew five plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vegged for like four and a half weeks
or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I grew varieties that were ready
around week nine and took nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here we were at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I harvest and then I take another soil
sample because I wanted to learn how much
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition I should expect plants to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was also planning on reamending
before my next site cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Leighton, let's go through this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see in the soil report now
after I've grown a cycle of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So look at organic matter percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went down by four solid points,
a little bit more than four points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you bounce back up to cation exchange
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That too dropped pretty significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You dropped by five plus points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that indicates to me is that your
organic matter was your primary source of
[SPEAKER_01]: cation exchange or the ability to store
nutrients in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that regard, I would encourage you
to top dress with a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: compost so that you're putting those
exchange sites back into play because as
[SPEAKER_01]: they get broken down from compost to silt,
you're losing the positive charges that
[SPEAKER_01]: would have been holding those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the drops that you're seeing though,
even though we do want to replenish and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the whole point of reamending,
these are drops that would be typical and
[SPEAKER_00]: expected after growing a cycle of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is giving you exactly what you're
missing if you're paying attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also showing that the system is
functioning, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like, oh, I grew plants and now
everything's out of whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, no, this is what we would
expect if you grew a proper living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also gives you the direction on
what you need to make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting back into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, if people get so overwhelmed at
looking at these reports and it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, you don't need all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be for someone who's very,
very heavy into soil science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, all you're looking at is exchange
capacity, organic matter, trace elements,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then your true saturated paste
percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at, for instance, the soluble
cations, it says calcium is up at 62,
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium at 41, potassium at 41,
sodium at 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you drop down to percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't match up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not even close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where you have to understand
that soluble means that it's potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: plant available, whereas the percent
actually represents what's being held on
[SPEAKER_01]: the cation exchange sites, which are
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of it as a battery for your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, look at your soluble cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium at start was 62, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end, 4.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you gobbled up a tremendous
amount of calcium in that run.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you drop down to percent,
you look at calcium, and it's 35.64,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it actually went up to 39.96.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that says is that as that calcium
that was in the soluble cation or plant
[SPEAKER_01]: available, some of that fell down and
attached to the cation exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at your magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your magnesium after at the end was
dropped all the way down to 25.62,
[SPEAKER_01]: which again is like the system is
functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's balancing it out, balancing itself
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium went from 12.34 all the way down
to 4.24.
[SPEAKER_01]: And worse, the sodium was at 12.6,
went up to 30.18.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that indicates to me that perhaps you
either have high levels of salt in your
[SPEAKER_01]: water that you're using to water the
plant, or you used a nutrient that had a
[SPEAKER_01]: salt base.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talk about mineral salts versus
organic nutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still going to be salts in organic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The organic nutrients are harder to break
down, which is why you need a tremendous
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of good biological diversity to
make those available.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the biology pulls things off,
it's going to leave behind the salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where it goes back to,
oh, flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flushing is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using excess water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to call it, I said it originally
as, oh, just waterboard that bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And forced me to rename it into a rain
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy rain event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy rain event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bottom line in this situation,
what I'd probably recommend is that you do
[SPEAKER_01]: a major rain event at the end of the
cycle, so that you push those salts down
[SPEAKER_01]: into the E horizon, where they can
naturally build up down there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they won't cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the gist and the
interesting things that have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so before you move on,
you said a whole bunch of provocative
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with how much sodium there
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I would like to understand is
when we look at the cation exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: section, it says that the sodium started
at 181 and finished at 117.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that looks like the sodium decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we originally talked about it,
you said, aha, this shows that there were
[SPEAKER_00]: no added salts in your inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was all happy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not using salt-based bottles
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said, yeah, you're not adding any
salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when we look at the soluble
cations, where you're having us look that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are, excuse me, the percent,
it went up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How come it looks like sodium went down in
the cation section, but the percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: went up?
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be contrasting in their
indications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, actually, they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soluble means that it's mobile or
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And percentage means it's bound to a
cation exchange site.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes back to think of that clay
platelet as a little flying saucer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And around the outside of that flying
saucer is 100 parking spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got 100 little pieces of these
primary nutrients, calcium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, and sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the sodium started in soluble
cations at 25, 5.23 and dropped all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way to 3.91 during the cycle, well,
they went somewhere, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They went down to percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those solubles, those salts that were
released are now stuck on your clay
[SPEAKER_01]: platelet and being stored.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't want them stored there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want them mobile, and we want them
moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to get rid of them or let them
naturally break down because there are
[SPEAKER_01]: some bacteria that can actually start
breaking salt apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, they just moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went from one place to another place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you follow me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all sodium is not the same on the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you're looking at what's being
stored.
[SPEAKER_01]: The percent is what's being stored on the
cation exchange site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soluble cations are the ones that
are more mobile in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can move.
[SPEAKER_01]: They either can get used up very quickly
or they can wash through the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to our third soil report
that we're going to hit real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where things get a little iffy,
my dear listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'm kind of throwing myself
under the bus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after seeing this report, the second
one showing me how much nutrition I used,
[SPEAKER_00]: I told Leighton that I was a big fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continue to be a good fan of the Kiss
Organics nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tad has put a lot of effort into
making a wide ranging blended amendment
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can just buy a bucket of and add
to your soil as amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will just amend all your different
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just makes things really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're an ultra nerd for this,
Tad at Kiss Organics, they will also
[SPEAKER_00]: custom blend you a nutrient pack as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually offered that to do that
for me, but I said, you know, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to practice with what's bought
right off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get the custom stuff,
but I will let people know that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is I followed the directions
on the label and I added my 18 cups of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient pack to the top and I watered it
in and then I covered it with some more
[SPEAKER_00]: soil from outside and watered it in and
kind of walked away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured, okay, you know, I'm doing a
fall harvest of my outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can just let this soil sit for
a while and just let it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just water it in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, I don't know, let it do biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was about three days into that
and I called Layton to let him know that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, oh, dude, you can't just
let the bed sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's all like, well, are the lights
off?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, yeah, the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to save money.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, yeah, he's all like,
the bed is alive because of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you turn off the light and if there
are no plants in the bed, you are just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like choking all of the biology
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to be cycling and ready
when you transplant in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, whoa, mind blown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I realized that I needed to plant
the bed so that plants would grow so that
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was ready to replant it,
you know, and focus more on it in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks after we harvested outdoor,
so the bed would be ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, oh, so I turned back on
the lights, you know, not at full power,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, you know, enough that the bed was
going to get lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put in a bunch of flowers and onions
and strawberries and chives and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just a whole bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basil, I just like bought that living
basil from the store and threw that in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, these were all temporary
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These weren't plants that I was going to
keep very long, but they were all plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was going to grow and then chop and
then cover with more soil and then plant
[SPEAKER_00]: my cannabis in three weeks when I was done
with harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who follow on the
Instagram, you got to see all the pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: of these, you know, beautiful strawberry
blonde calendula and the pink dandelions
[SPEAKER_00]: and the strawberries I was eating out of
there and the onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really great to be producing food
for myself out of this indoor tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was all really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it was time to get another soil
test, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I wanted to see and ensure that
the amendments that I had used had brought
[SPEAKER_00]: up my numbers again and I was ready to
grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took my test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent it into Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it back and I was disappointed
because the numbers were lower than I
[SPEAKER_00]: expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had done everything right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went back to Layton and I'm all
like, Layton, you know, why aren't these
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers higher?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know that this product works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's raised my numbers before,
but it didn't this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's all like, well, you were growing
plants in there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh yeah, I got great food
and plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, dude, they were taking up
more of your nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the beds, they're stopping
its uptake of nutrition just because you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have cannabis plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had both amended the bed way too
much and I waited a while because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: busy doing other things and then tested
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had used up most, if not all of the
amendments that I had put in there three
[SPEAKER_00]: months earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a life lesson for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have to remember that all these
companion plants I'm using are actively
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling on the nutrition as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, in retrospect,
that's like totally obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at my timeframe, Layton,
what do you think the timeframe should be
[SPEAKER_00]: between, like you end the cycle,
I take the test, I get back my results,
[SPEAKER_00]: I add my nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long should I wait?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how long should I be watering in
those amendments and let them settle
[SPEAKER_00]: before I replant with cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long should I water that stuff in
before I put in the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, again, you're continuing to
grow plants throughout the cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though it's not cannabis,
now it's called a resting bed where you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got, you know, other plants in there that
are, you know, keeping the living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: system alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really want to, again, if you're
going to plant in three weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, take another soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now again, you'll know what your
companions or your foods that you grew in
[SPEAKER_01]: there have taken out or be proactive and
understand that your numbers are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you look at like primaries,
nitrate and aluminum in the beginning of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cycle, you know, you were at 356 for
nitrates and ammonia was at 6.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the cycle, you were down to
89.5 in the nitrate and 0.5 in the
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then bounce over to the one that you
just took and your nitrates are at 18.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've continued to go down and your
ammonia is at 0.3.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really need a good source of
nitrogen in this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That like, you know, I don't know how much
pigs blood you tend to use traditionally,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I would say whatever you were using,
you need to double it for now to get these
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers back up to where they need to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's true with the molybdenum,
as I pointed out before, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's down to less than 0.02.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a critical trace for,
you know, plant function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you know, these are giving you
things that you need to know as tools,
[SPEAKER_01]: how best to amend next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you're going to need a good source
of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use a slow release, you know,
oyster shell flower, or you could use like
[SPEAKER_01]: a liquid calcium source, like hortical,
which is an organic 4% calcium that's also
[SPEAKER_01]: acts as a nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this gets really complex, so I'm not
going to go down this rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the interaction between calcium and
nitrogen is a really interesting one and
[SPEAKER_01]: not one that is often talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look back at some of Rudolf
Steiner's work in the 20s, he talks about
[SPEAKER_01]: these in forms that don't really make
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's talking about ethereal and
terrestrial planes, and it's really what
[SPEAKER_01]: he's talking about is nitrogen and calcium
and the relationship they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those would be the starting points that
I would really encourage you to focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, soluble calcium went from 62 down
to 4.5 after the end of the run with your
[SPEAKER_01]: most recent test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your calcium went back up to 37.58.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, whatever you amended had a
good source of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you're going to you're going to
want more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in the percentages stuck on your
cation exchange site, remember that that
[SPEAKER_01]: number I just gave you for calcium was
soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's mobile and it's one of the
nutrients that you've added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you look down on your
percentages, your cation exchange sites,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're down to 31.94.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've lost again your ability to store
that stuff on a cation exchange site.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's really important that
you get a more mobile liquid source of
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium to help to bump off the potassium,
which is 27 way too high, bump the sodium
[SPEAKER_01]: off, which is 11.41.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that good calcium, liquid calcium
source is really going to help you a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: in getting this bed back to a wonderful or
a good place for the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the main lesson that I've
learned from this is number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do your soil test until you're ready
to transplant your cannabis plants and put
[SPEAKER_00]: them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because after you have done you do your
test and then you do your amendments and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you add your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas what I did is I did my test,
did my amendments, and then I waited a
[SPEAKER_00]: month with resting plants in there that
was eating up nutrition and throwing me
[SPEAKER_00]: back off balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to then I went to add my
plants and it was no longer as robust as I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, I needed to do another
test and then reamend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I screwed myself with that resting
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly I lost yield per year as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think I'll do that resting
period again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say that the interesting
thing was that you saw what the goal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw what you started with and you saw
what you ended with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that starting and getting that
test is critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you're ready to plant your
cannabis plants, like two to three weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: three to four weeks before you're ready to
plant your cannabis plants, then do your
[SPEAKER_01]: ending test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you had that resting period where
those onions and those other cover crops
[SPEAKER_01]: and companion plants gobbled up more
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that, you know, I'm glad you
did this because you're really seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though you amended, you still
lost more nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you know, lesson learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start test and just before, you know,
three weeks or four weeks before planting,
[SPEAKER_01]: the next run, that's when you want to do
your ending test so that you can figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out what you need to put in play for the
next run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, even if the nutrients
are, you know, like organic form,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, like an oyster meal flour or,
you know, feather meal or whatever that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're putting into play, you can plant
right after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have what's called the cook down
phase, which is what super soils do is
[SPEAKER_01]: they, you know, they basically blend you
all these high nutrients and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: say, don't use it right away because
you're going to burn your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you try to plant it, you got to let it
cook off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically what's happening is you're
going into a thermophilic process where
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and nitrogen and carbon are being
eaten and broken down and you're releasing
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonia, which is another form of nitrogen
because they've, they've broken it apart
[SPEAKER_01]: as a gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're losing, you're losing nutrient
value in that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you, again, if you don't allow the
biology to break it down or bust it into
[SPEAKER_01]: more usable pieces, then it's going to
kill your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the case of your situation where
you're just amending with, with hard
[SPEAKER_01]: organic nutrients, other than the pig's
blood, that's a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: These nutrients are going to stay in play
in the soil for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A longer period of times they're not,
they're not soluble, but they're not,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not mobile either.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're, they're bound up in,
in their, um, in their raw form,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes them kind of slow release.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Till the biology breaks it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's good because the plant
will actually say, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need any of that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to feed this exudate for
this bacteria to break that down,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I will, when I come to a point in the,
in my growth cycle where I need it,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I'll release exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll grow out those bacterials and I'll
mine that source of nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for going through that,
that, that arduous soil report situation
[SPEAKER_00]: with me, uh, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so let's go ahead and take our
last break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we come back, we're going to
start talking about, um, uh, some,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little less technical stuff like,
uh, like cover crops and scrawling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and my guest today is soil biologist,
Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of good people launching
new businesses in cannabis, psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very strange time for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same moment that psilocybin
mushrooms are illegal at the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: level, they are becoming increasingly
legal in states across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: These businesses leading the way into the
future of plant medicines require
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized legal representation by
attorneys who have depth, not only in
[SPEAKER_00]: litigation, mergers and acquisitions,
but also in psychedelic and other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green light law group has been empowering
cannabis businesses since 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the market has diversified into
psilocybin and other plant medicines,
[SPEAKER_00]: green light has been right there,
evolving with their diverse clients to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide legal expertise with a high level
of legal acumen, creative strategy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and precision that comes with an intimate
and specific understanding of both
[SPEAKER_00]: business law and plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a business owner trying to
navigate the layered local and national
[SPEAKER_00]: drug laws on your own, you are at risk of
fumbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: These confusing and quickly changing laws
complicate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green light law group is ready to help you
when hit with a lawsuit or because you
[SPEAKER_00]: were shafted by a vendor or business
partner, or simply because you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay legal and could use some preventative
guidance before cultivating a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substance as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green light law group is a collection of
folks who care profoundly about their
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this is true because I know the
folks from green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a huge difference between a big
legal firm who has decided to start
[SPEAKER_00]: representing a few drug companies versus
working with a collection of high
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity, passionate lawyers who are
personally interested in new plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines and firmly believe in their
power to heal.

learn more about the services they can
[SPEAKER_00]: offer your industry leading cannabis or
psychedelics company.

[SPEAKER_00]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a replacement for using peat
[SPEAKER_00]: moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss has long been the go to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_00]: container growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But organic growers know that peat moss is
an unsustainable resource and the mining
[SPEAKER_00]: of peat bogs destroys habitat and releases
sequestered carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there's finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that shares the
[SPEAKER_00]: same benefits while also being
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems, it actually is made from
upcycled organic paper and tree bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption and water conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades long
[SPEAKER_00]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat
moss and handles exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like peat moss, pit moss is inert so
it won't change your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available in a range of preparations
including a nutrient enhanced blend,
[SPEAKER_00]: a coco coir blend and also as an organic
soil conditioner with no added nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding.

[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company, let them know
Shango sent ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Lose, and my guest
today is soil biologist, Leighton
[SPEAKER_00]: Morrison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Leighton, here we are, third set,
bringing it all on home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I want to point out is
how many plants to grow in this
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with all of the nutrition,
with us being able to add more if we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to, it's not really the amount of
nutrition that is going to be limiting the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of plants we could have.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to end up limiting it is the
space we're going to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, against all of the good opinion I
got from all of my friends, I grew five
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in a four by four tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's all like, what the hell
are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just going to overgrow the tent so
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I was more interested in
flavor variety than necessarily like
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to grow five different tastes,
five different flavors, just for my own
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not growing the stuff to sell,
I'm just growing the stuff to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, while I understood that five
plants was probably going to impact my
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, because the plants were really
competing, I didn't really care all that
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do agree, five plants is too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growing on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was growing a lot of plant matter
that never finished because it had other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants growing over the top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially because one of them was the
Bicket OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Bicket OG, the GMO Cherry Pie
Cross from Nick Rysden, it is a beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned my tent into a freaking cage
match.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just wanted to overgrow everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to continually trim it down
during veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even after flower, it was just
trying to climb over everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've kind of learned my lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going down to four plants for this
next round, which is still probably too
[SPEAKER_00]: many.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I want the flavors and I'm
gonna scrog it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I fail again, so be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cover crops that I liked the most
is primarily for cover crops, I use
[SPEAKER_00]: Dichondra repens, which is a very short,
about one inch ground cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a green plant and it's commonly used
in between the bricks of fancy driveways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they have those ornamental paver
bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can drive your car on your
driveway, but then there's this beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're very resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hold their own water and they just
grow thousands of these individuated
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also did ever-bearing alpine
strawberries because I wanted to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some flowers, including pink
dandelions and strawberry blonde
[SPEAKER_00]: calendula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just fun, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing of the thing though,
that I was not planning on though,
[SPEAKER_00]: was when the scrog filled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we start talking trash about
how the scrog acted on the cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: Layton, will you please explain the
importance of companion planting from the
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective of number one, the various
roots of the plants talking to each other
[SPEAKER_00]: and then number two, helping fight the
surface from becoming hydrophobic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the cover crops are amazing in
the regard that they create a microclimate
[SPEAKER_01]: right on the surface of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the soil's not getting dried out due to
the wind, the air moving that you have in
[SPEAKER_01]: the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also preventing the lights from
cooking the biology on the surface of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's literally as the water
evaporates, it's hitting the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: these little leaves and then dripping back
down onto the soil again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in many ways, you're allowing a natural
little micro ecosystem to occur right at
[SPEAKER_01]: the surface soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what's going on underneath the soil is
even more important because yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is communicating, especially if
you have mycorrhizae fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of work there's some amazing
things that we are learning at an
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly fast pace about mycorrhizae and
some of these other plant interactions and
[SPEAKER_01]: how they communicate with each other
through the movement of different
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry that's happening in the
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: We now know that there's certain bacteria
that will actually enter into the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizae and transfer to different
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also on the outside is a superhighway
of all kinds of bacteria as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: predators like amoebas and flagellates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, there's this whole, think of it
as the internet, like a whole web that's
[SPEAKER_01]: providing transportation of both nutrient,
mineral and biology back and forth between
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that interaction between roots
and biology is critical for, let me ask
[SPEAKER_01]: you this, did you have any pests,
even though you had that tent packed with
[SPEAKER_01]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I actually didn't have any pests.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them during the actual growing
experience, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you asked me the day that I ended,
I would have said, I had no pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I attribute that in my head mostly to
the fact that I worked with my consultant
[SPEAKER_00]: from Copert, Beneficial Insects,
and I placed beneficial insects in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent that were preventatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I assumed that that is why I got
through this run with no pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, when I went through and I
harvested and I went through and I
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed, I found two sun leaves that were
face to face with a slight slit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like normally where you'll see
like spiders living, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found like maybe 100 aphids in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was startled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, where the hell did these aphids
come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see them anywhere else in the
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had set up a home just in between
these two leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so technically there were pests there,
but there was like nearly no pest
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would attribute that to a healthy
biological system and healthy plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: are strong and resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that makes sense too, because the
aphid, the place where they grew,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was in between two leaves from one of
the plants that was suffering by being
[SPEAKER_00]: overgrown by the Bicado G.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll find a place that's weakest and
then try to, you know, grow out in that
[SPEAKER_01]: place and then, you know, get a population
big enough that they can attack other
[SPEAKER_01]: healthier plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you know, if plant health,
if the plants are healthy enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will deter pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in many ways you had that
because of the way you grew, the level of
[SPEAKER_01]: biology that you had in there because of
what happened with the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was a real indicator that you
put in a very diverse inoculant that's
[SPEAKER_01]: present now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will see it again in this next
run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me ask you another hard question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did your plants turn out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they were the best plants that I've
ever grown in my life, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on one hand, duh, because outside
in the Pacific Northwest where I live,
[SPEAKER_00]: we start to get cold and rains the last
week of September, first week of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most eight-week plants need to go at
least until the middle of October here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't finish outdoor plants
really, you know, coastal Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of the plants need two more
weeks when we pull them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so as my friend Johnny told me the
other day, he said, oh, so when you grew
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor, it's the first time that you grew
finished plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were beautiful, colorful,
dense, a complex terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't much pest pressure or like
chewing of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like an Olympic team and they
tasted freaking incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a wild success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to hear that, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, again, it just it goes to
show that if you do the right things and
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at the bigger picture,
then you're going to have a better,
[SPEAKER_01]: more rich plant because you have had the
biology and you have the diversity and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have all the components that everything
needs to function properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, kudos to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you had such a great run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, of course, appreciate your your
help on all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's let's talk about the cover crop
and then see see into talking about Scrog,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's one thing I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk often about I really like pink
dandelions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're an heirloom flower that just has
become popular because Baker Creek seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: is putting it out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you if you do go and you're like,
oh, pink dandelions, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you go buy a pack of seeds for
three bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just make sure that you don't
let them go to seed when you are in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, because it absolutely sucks to
have those little white puffs of dandelion
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds floating around in the tent and
getting in your sticky flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I do is I just let them grow
up and they look cool during veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anything that goes to seed during
veg, I like grab those seeds and I harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: them and I share them with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if anything goes to seed, during
flower, I just go ahead and pull off the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds before before they fully form,
because I'm not willing to risk that just
[SPEAKER_00]: for some, you know, for some beautiful
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like like I know which flowers I'm
growing, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so then the second thing I want to talk
about is the experience that I had using
[SPEAKER_00]: the Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and this was actually probably the
biggest challenge I had during the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I had the plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up I started weaving them through the
Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start competing for space
excessively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and and what I found was because
the plants were so strong and because I so
[SPEAKER_00]: fully filled in the Scrog, what happened
was it cut off the light to the soil down
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up until this point, you know,
I had the whole bottom filled with all
[SPEAKER_00]: these green plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dichondra and flowers and alpine
strawberries and all this great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when the light got cut off from an
effectively done Scrog, all those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: below started to suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dichondra started to pull back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strawberries pulled back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started not looking happy down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I realized that I was I was
starting to experience big gaps of exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: soil top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want that because when you
have bare exposed soil, you no longer have
[SPEAKER_00]: that little Amazonian buffer of weather in
the in the inch above the soil from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dichondra repens and strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and with that bare soil, you can start
getting something hydrophobic,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be watering the top and the water
just kind of like slides off the side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bed and goes down the side and it
doesn't go into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, shit, I don't know what
I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after after asking around to Layton
and some of my other friends, I realized
[SPEAKER_00]: that what I wanted to do was to replace
that green mulch, that green tops cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop with wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I'm like, all right, because if I
used wood chips, then I could grow
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow a variety of mushrooms and I'm
like, oh, my God, how cool would it be to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to grow some cooking mushrooms,
culinary mushrooms below my cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: the in the shady area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so what I did is I, you know,
I didn't really have good access to wood
[SPEAKER_00]: chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because I live on an island with lots
of artists, I was able to find really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, hardwood like refuse from
woodworkers on the island who make like
[SPEAKER_00]: bowls and utensils and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice organic alder and and oak and
madrone and other other hardwoods that
[SPEAKER_00]: maple and and use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to get those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of fun because they're all
in curly hues as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they look festive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got a couple of huge bags of that
just gifted to me from artists on the
[SPEAKER_00]: island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put that on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so essentially, I I just choked out
the rest of the way all of the cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but before I put that down,
I reached out to my buddy Seth from Ready
[SPEAKER_00]: Set Shroom and and I got some golden
oyster and I got some wine cap inoculated,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sawdust and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and he shipped those up to me and
I put those down so that when I put down
[SPEAKER_00]: these hardwoods on top of it, eventually
those mushrooms occupied the hardwood and
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got some edible mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that part of it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the part the part I would like you to
speak to Leighton is that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: were really concerned for me that I had
put air quotes wood chips on top because
[SPEAKER_00]: they said that the wood chips were going
to steal nitrogen from the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that concerned me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I told you about it,
you explained to me that what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, what that biology is
between wood chips, nitrogen and the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you also explained why this
wasn't going to happen with these cured
[SPEAKER_00]: hardwood bits that I was using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you go through that for all of us?
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the living plant, we talked a little
bit earlier about endophytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all different types of biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens when you take fresh green
trees, branches, whatever, and you chip
[SPEAKER_01]: them up, they're going to go through the
thermophilic process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to start breaking nitrogen
down, breaking carbon down and heating up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's where you have a
problem, because basically those
[SPEAKER_01]: thermophytes are going to steal any form
of nitrogen that they can find and
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially starve the plant out because
they're stealing it all to break down
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where fresh new chips are
absolutely problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old age chips that are punky, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Curly hardwoods, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been cured, kiln dried,
left to, or I should say not left,
[SPEAKER_01]: but processed so that they don't warp and
twist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's not even comparable to what
people would think of as fresh wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's old wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has gone through very much a
pasteurizing process so that it's usable
[SPEAKER_01]: wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this pasteurizing process, it removes
much of the water from it because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: dried out and cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so without that water component,
yes, they will break down, but they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: break down in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not going to be stealing
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfectly said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfectly said.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for hitting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Scrog was very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you use a Scrog properly,
it essentially created every nug on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was a cola, which I was astonished
to see for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will now Scrog everything like
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I recommend that you consider
Scrogging if you have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Layton, this brings us to the end of
third set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is everything we wanted to talk
about today, doing kind of like this
[SPEAKER_00]: debrief from the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have been assistant quarterback on
this project from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've taught me and you have caught me
from making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just kind of put myself at
your mercy, I guess, and just say from
[SPEAKER_00]: from what you have seen, is there anything
that we haven't talked about today that
[SPEAKER_00]: either somewhere between I didn't do right
or I could have done better that we
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't talked about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was there anything else that stands out
for you that we should mention?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have loved to see you make a
biological compost there using your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, your leaves, everything that
you've pulled off, as well as combining it
[SPEAKER_01]: with some stuff outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of using just all wood
hardwood shavings, I'd have loved you to
[SPEAKER_01]: mix those hardwood shavings in with that
biologically rich compost that you made.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the only thing that I could
really complain about, because I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, based on our conversation,
you did all of the steps, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, nothing's perfect in
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have to try to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your combinations of materials,
your effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I loved the fact that you smashed
rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love when you called me and said,
I'm just going to get stone and bust rocks
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a day later, you called me back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God, you didn't warn me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and I'll reiterate,
why you want jagged edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more jagged edges there are,
there's more surface area for the biology
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow out its biofilm and begin to break
that rock down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's smooth, it's basically
polished.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the problem is the polish
doesn't really allow them to set up in
[SPEAKER_01]: those tiny little crevices and pores and
little tiny micro cracks that would have
[SPEAKER_01]: been, you know, a jagged edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty much, you know,
the only pieces of the puzzle that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think, you know, I just want to make sure
the listeners understand the reasons why,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I encourage you to make your own
biological compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this biological compost, what's it made
out of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you mean like the parts of the
cannabis plants that were not the flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have liked to have seen me
biologically compost the sun leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: the stem and like all the other biological
parts like after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that your point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: After harvest, every time you should be
taking anything that you're not keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: and blend it with local greens and browns
to the ratios we talked about and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: as soaking wet as you possibly can,
make a nice little pile of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: get a compost thermometer, monitor it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get over the thermophilic
process, in other words, once it hits a
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and then starts going down,
as soon as it goes down to 100 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: throw a whole bunch of seeds on it and let
those seeds grow and put miles of
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere throughout that compost pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's like, oh, you're stealing
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing out biology, which is what
you really want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything that grows there is going
to die there and fall back down and make
[SPEAKER_01]: you more compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the trick to really getting a
very biologically rich compost pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: The compost that you can use as a top
dress because we lost, you lost cation
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lost organic matter between the start
and the very end results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to put that back in play.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chips are great as a way to keep that
microclimate in the top of the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's also, it's not going to give you
the kind of nutrition and biology that a
[SPEAKER_01]: compost would have done in the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Leighton, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, let's see, I got a couple layers of
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for taking your time
with me today and doing this debrief of
[SPEAKER_00]: what the first cycle was like and how we
thought our way through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really we're not, we're not really
trying to teach a specific recipe that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to use every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to share a perspective of how
these horizons work indoors so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: bio-mimic re as much of the natural
systems from the outdoors indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so thank you for, you know,
joining me for the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also brother, thank you for
spending your time with me on this
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the hours of phone calls and me
calling you because I was upset because
[SPEAKER_00]: something wasn't working right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you essentially just, you know,
making sure that I didn't like run my ship
[SPEAKER_00]: into an iceberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I greatly appreciate both your
experience and your willingness to play
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I'm glad that there's another
more public example of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of thank yous and DMs and
texts and emails about this and how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: made people's lives so much easier because
you're not, you're not fighting the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're letting the plant guide you
and you're just participating in its life,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, that's kind of the way
nature works.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we don't, well, humans have tried to
fight nature since, you know, we got
[SPEAKER_01]: started expanding, but in reality,
we were just stewards of the planet before
[SPEAKER_01]: we, you know, got crazy and then,
you know, just started expanding like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or breeding like, you know,
rabbits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that's kind of why, you know,
I think so many people have thanked me is
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's, it's made their watering
practices easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're, they've got healthier plants,
um, that biological diversity is much
[SPEAKER_01]: greater.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore the expressions that we're
all looking for those, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: second and tertiary metabolites,
um, are more potent or are more expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's again, biomimicry copy nature
and, um, get those, you know, get those
[SPEAKER_01]: good, uh, diverse biological communities
up and running for you and let them do the
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my pleasure, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get letters all the time about that,
um, episode 54, on biomimicry and people
[SPEAKER_00]: are all like, you have totally changed
how, um, I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for, you know,
doing that episode with Layton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, it seems to be one of the things
that we talk about here on shaping fire
[SPEAKER_00]: that really, you know, hit a nerve with
people, uh, in both directions,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people who are very
excited and they're using it and they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's people who are all like,
this is not how I learned how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need to do some pushback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I appreciate that too,
as long as people are being polite about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to hear more shaping fire
episodes with our dear friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Layton Morrison, um, you can go to shaping
fire episode 54 on, uh, geology and
[SPEAKER_00]: biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the original place where we
talk about this horizon system,
[SPEAKER_00]: this horizon style, and explain the,
uh, the philosophy behind it, the why,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that we use it in, um, containment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can also check out shaping fire
episode 59 with Layton Morrison,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just simply called water and
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it explains the, the life of,
uh, the hydro life of your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, it kind of gives you an
idea of exactly how much to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, more recently episode 82 on deploying,
um, aerobic and anaerobic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, that is a mind opening and you'll
learn a lot about the types of compost
[SPEAKER_00]: teas that you're going to want to use on
different varieties of soil at different
[SPEAKER_00]: times of life as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you want to follow along,
um, Layton, um, you can follow his
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram at Kingdom Aquaponics LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find out what he's up to and
also get announcements for his,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, incredibly popular podcast on the
Future Cannabis Project YouTube channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is on Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if you follow him on Instagram,
um, you will always know who his upcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: guest is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, if you want to find out
more about this, um, this, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative tent that we grow in the
shaping fire offices that we're using as
[SPEAKER_00]: this demo tent that we've been talking
about today, um, you can find lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: posts about it, um, at shaping fire of
Instagram, uh, where we post updates and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to's and a lot of mistakes that I made
so that's always a pretty good laugh as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
