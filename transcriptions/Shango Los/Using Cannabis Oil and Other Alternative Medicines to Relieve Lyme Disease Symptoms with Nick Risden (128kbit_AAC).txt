[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everybody, Shango from Shaping Fire
here with our friend Nick Rysden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here visiting my folks in Michigan
today and Nick and I have been wanting to
[SPEAKER_02]: get together for a long time because as
many of you know, Nick is a Lyme patient
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's pretty much trailblazed using
concentrated cannabis oil that we mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: know as RSO when fighting Lyme disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been talking about this for a
couple years and I asked him, I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey man, why don't we record something so
that we can get his best practices out to
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are on a beautiful fall
Michigan day cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, Nick, thanks for making time,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start at the top, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we first started talking about it a
few years ago, the reason it came up was
[SPEAKER_02]: because you said, long time cannabis guy,
but that you had come across a particular
[SPEAKER_02]: RSO that like was a total game changer for
you and caused you to like go down this
[SPEAKER_02]: new path.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we start there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about like this first time you had
an RSO that told you that, oh man,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can use this to treat my Lyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, the first time it was kind
of a story I told you about going to a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and all that and raw juice and
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never believed in marijuana as
medicine per se, but after I got bit by
[SPEAKER_00]: the tick and landed and I was in ICU for a
month, it was four years ago in Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had me on so many medications that at
one point I was up to 71 medications a
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if one of them worked,
how would you really know on that level,
[SPEAKER_00]: which wasn't the cross contaminations of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I explained to you inside,
like when I first got sick four years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believed in doctors and in hospitals
that you get sick and that they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to treat you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was the first case of Powassan
virus, meningococcal encephalitis
[SPEAKER_00]: infection, Kentucky had ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a 75th case since 1908 and I was the
first one to live through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't know what to do and they
experimented on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Kentucky, there was no medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would put me on prescription
drobinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was $400 for 10 pills of
synthetic THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on all that medicine and you know,
the seizures started hardcore after all
[SPEAKER_00]: the IV antibiotics from, you know,
I was in the hospital all June and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they had me going back to the hospital all
July for IV rosephan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that stopped, the seizure started
and I'd never had seizures before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had read some information about CBD oil
and I'd read some information about this
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Simpson oil stuff that, and I've been
in cannabis my whole life, but I never
[SPEAKER_00]: really believed in medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we come up to Michigan to a dispensary
and had a friend with a medical card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember every part of this story
with my brain injury the way it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this was so remarkable to me that we
drove all the way up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got here at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't go in because I couldn't go
into the bat because I didn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical card, but I sat in the front and
they had a raw juice bar and had CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that they would add to the raw juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that was my first experience ever with
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at the time I shook uncontrollably,
um, almost have an MS, um, and I had light
[SPEAKER_00]: phobia, which I still have, but not,
but not to that extent that even at night
[SPEAKER_00]: watching TV, I'd have to wear sunglasses
because I couldn't encephalize and
[SPEAKER_00]: meningitis light would burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this lady gave me a raw juice cannabis
shot while we're sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just micro greens with some CBD and I
took it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of seconds later,
Shannon reached over and touched my elbow
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, you're not shaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when she said that I lowered my
sunglasses to look at my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I wasn't shaking and the light
caught my eyes and it wasn't burning my
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the exact moment when I'm like,
Oh, cannabis is medicine for, for being in
[SPEAKER_00]: this for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And never truly believing that cannabis
was medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I explained this to you earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you smoke a joint like to lower
stress or I believe cancer patients smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana or something gave them appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, he gets me some RSO there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened to be above a cush RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the big issues with me was
sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're in so much pain,
you're hurting, you're vomiting around the
[SPEAKER_00]: clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're having seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I introduced this, um, you know,
just a 0.1 milligrams of RSO in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, just like a little dot on the
side of the plastic capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I slept for 12 straight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you sleep, it allows the
antibiotics, which I do believe in to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do their job and start to let me
heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was sleeping so much in recovery,
but Oh, I skipped over a very vital thing
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you this earlier inside that we did
the raw juice shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'd lost, 80 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a pizza place and ate half,
half three quarters of a pizza and hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: done that since I got sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, okay, I'm not shaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes aren't hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just got appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just from CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bubble cush was the first
start that actually, um, it gave me sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and it gave me pain control,
that Indica and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just consumed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm in Kentucky and I have seven
felonies from growing in 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Kentucky, a half a gram RSO was a
felon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm very adamant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about what I believe in and I
trained police dogs for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of made it difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, um, you know, uh, uh,
there was a politician, Matt Daly and the
[SPEAKER_00]: secretary of state in Kentucky,
Allison Lundgren Grimes, they wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: push medical camps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to push cannabis four years
ago for the Kentucky patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they used my story and they made me a
kind of the face of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fought for it in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it failed, I'd kind of out of
myself, you know, again, and I moved
[SPEAKER_00]: instantly to Michigan so that I could
access RSO and be able to access,
[SPEAKER_00]: even then I'm looking at strain specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke a joint above a cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel a certain type of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke a joint, a kosher cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel a certain type of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different strains do different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kosher cush, you can give me that joint
blind in a bowl of joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I smoke kosher cush, I'm eating in
30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not, there's, there's a handful of
strains that actually do that to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me an appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so moving up to Michigan, it was
about, I need to grow as many different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains as I can, cook them all down to
see which ones are working the best for my
[SPEAKER_00]: individual needs at individual times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what all research went through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I moved up here, uh, three and a half
years ago and one day I'm sitting,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, I'm in my grow room and I'm alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm, I'm born and raised Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all my friends and family there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very lonely up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shannon had to stay at our dog kennel in
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we had a lot of farm animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't just up and move everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I listened to podcasts around the
clock and you know, I'm trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to grow again to, to the level that
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to go into organics,
not synthetics, which I've done for my
[SPEAKER_00]: whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came across to you and I didn't know
you from Adam and, uh, that the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast was, uh, you and mean gene from
Mendocino talking about powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I go, I, I delve deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go down the whole more because I'm,
um, I've got YouTube there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm listening to it nonstop,
you know, and I'm, I'm listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: different grow videos and you find some
very amateurish grow videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you find something that is
professional, I'm like, this Kevin Jodra
[SPEAKER_00]: or you, and then you're interviewing this
Kevin Jodra guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started listening to this Kevin
Jodra guy and I'm like, smartest dude I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever heard talk about anything period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're out there, uh, like to take you
mentally back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when you were like doing your
podcast, like green bicycles and some with
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Jodra, you're doing those little
segments where you do like 10 segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I listened to every one of the breeder
series that Kevin Jodra did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first thing I sponsored.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that I grew seeds from every
single guy in that breeder series?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some of them are actually like
friends, friends talk to on the phone
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times a week and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That changed my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like your podcast that, that, well,
anyway, let, let me scale back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jackson is talking about, there were
mean gene from medicinal was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew resistant strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking at this from a sick person
that got Lyme disease and meningitis,
[SPEAKER_00]: Powassan disease, uh, meningitis,
Babesia Bartonella, uh, Rocky mountains,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Rocky mountains, uh, fever,
spotted tick fever, rickets, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Babesia Bartonella, just all this shit
from a tick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all stuff that is hosting and
feeding off of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I start researching the powdery mildew
and the powdery mildew, uh, goes down and
[SPEAKER_00]: it spores and it is sinking like an anchor
through, through the meristem of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and then anchoring in and hosting off and
then feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking, wow, if this plant is
powdery mildew resistant, that means it's
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if I take plants into RSO that are
like that, that that will help my
[SPEAKER_00]: condition more because I'm battling
parasitic infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're making a, uh, a corollary that
if the plant can defend itself from
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew, maybe it'll help you
defend yourself from the parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's defending itself from parasites
trying to host off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already got them in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so I'm listening to all these
podcasts and listen to all this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm up in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm by myself and I'd been in California
several years ago for six months training
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs on Coronado Island in San Diego at a
contract out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got my medical card when I was out
there and it was like a three year
[SPEAKER_00]: California medical card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still valid for six months at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Shannon's in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sick as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even supposed to drive the car up
here, stuck in the house growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I booked a plane ticket, uh, San Francisco
from Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go and get on a plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fly to San Francisco, drive up to Warner
land nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy the rule seven cut ship it back to
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to this research everywhere where I can
find this mean gene from Mendocino guys
[SPEAKER_00]: gear and compassionate hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You call it the only place I could even
find the seeds three, three and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I fly all the way there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meet Brandon from third gen family farm
who happened to be there that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw my portal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Told us explain my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude hooked me up with some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never met me before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a bunch of mean genes gear,
flew back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rule seven was waiting for me on a porch
when I got there overnight to rock it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it out, um, start taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, took me, uh, about three months from
that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is around end of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I don't know how to explain how it
was changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My legs were getting stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The antibiotics were more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was gaining weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting muscle mass back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, I was up here and I was thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was learning how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to go to, uh, the hospital in
Washington DC for a week every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd leave DC or leave Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shannon would leave Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd meet up in DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd get treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd come back and the doctors like,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're dancing faster than the
other Lyme disease patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else are you adding into?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to him about the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to him about, which he
promoted the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor did, but I'm talking to him
about the THC because he is very medical
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he needs to know exact milligrams,
exact, you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm trying to figure out which plant
works, which, which dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at first I started off with a
drop of RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm keep building up till I can get to
a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I got on the rule seven,
I'm doing blood work constantly and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: showing my blood work is doing better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's showing that, um, that the
antibiotics are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after about two months of this,
the Emerald Cuff is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to fly out there and to tell
some of these people like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Mountain, to tell them like,
yo, your Royal Cush is helping to tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: and Gene from Mendocino, yo, your,
uh, your podcast changed my life to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I flew out with the smartest lady I've
ever met, a neurosurgical nurse and my
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went out there and she was in the
Humboldt or the Emerald Cuff sessions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like learning as much as she
could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw you in there and I couldn't walk
up and say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was just, you know, um, you helped
save my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did stand in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked up and I talked to me and Gene
and walked up and talked to, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Mountain, bought a bunch of seeds,
uh, talked to Capula, a friend of mine and
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me a bunch of Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, but I presented my,
my doctors and the nurse actually showed
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like, no, this is actually working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from the medical standpoint,
we don't understand why we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure it out, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember when I walked up and shared
all this stuff to Jackson and I had like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a doctor there and a nurse and I've
got all these medical files and I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: port in my chest and I'm like,
your shit saved my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this whole line of people
waiting to get into his booth and his
[SPEAKER_00]: jaws, like, cause I'm showing him,
like I'm breaking down Osmey and Nirla
[SPEAKER_00]: doll, um, you know, in your lines,
powdery mildew resistance, battling the
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done a lot of research on his
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all the research in front of me
and I'm breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just out there like, yo,
this helped me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like here, here's the blood work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're from this week to this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're speaking fast cause you don't
want to take up too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My creatine levels went up, my blood
pressure regulated, the seizures dropped,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was supposed to be dead from this
shit a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that I'm still sitting here,
even having this conversation is a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: miracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're, they like to scare me
with every eight months being like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you only got so much more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still here at four years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did come back to these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I went through mean genes,
pina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found a particular female that
helped me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been many phenos route-wise
soul dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a king side chick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one helped me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I had a sunshine, sunshine daydream
from Bodhi that happy little tree company
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was off the charts in Nirla doll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff helped with shaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm constantly looking for different
plants for different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so let me clarify for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're telling me is that you,
you found that the Royal Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: which you went after because of its
powdery mildew resistance, it was helping
[SPEAKER_02]: so much as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not only is it helping with the
powdery mildew, just being a good plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's, it's got some uniqueness about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you, you delineated that it was
the Ossamine and the Neridol that were the
[SPEAKER_02]: two things that you wanted to hunt for
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I getting you right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Ossamine and Neridol from,
um, research into the NIH archives and the
[SPEAKER_00]: national Institute of health have archives
that anybody can access.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have published papers that show that
marijuana was killing cancer cells in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1979.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they also have stuff on parasitic
killing, you know, Ossamine, Neridol,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tea tree, old tree, you know,
different stuff working on different
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at stuff that people in
Africa, uh, tribes and stuff used for
[SPEAKER_00]: centuries with malaria and parasitic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ossamine and Neridol kept coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ossamine and Neridol don't pump out of
Royal Kush to that level, like sunshine,
[SPEAKER_00]: daydream, different things, but it was the
powdery mildew, just overall resistance of
[SPEAKER_00]: Royal seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for you all that have never ran Royal
seven, I have seen a plant with bud rot
[SPEAKER_00]: and coated in powdery mildew laying on the
Royal seven and not a drop of it on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we had in Michigan, this is,
I started growing in 1995 when I was 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the wettest year that I've ever
grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year is this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had more mud rot than I ever dealt with
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even my neighbor, who he farms 3000
acres of corn around here said this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: wettest winter ever for him on corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been having to cook their corn off
in ovens at night to keep the molds and
[SPEAKER_00]: never stand down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Royal seven here, not a drop,
not a drop, not, I mean, it's amazing what
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you look at that, did every,
did other plants beside her dropping off
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's still hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're looking forward to,
to, to fix yourself when you're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the same things, you're dealing with
the same parasitic infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now I've tried to experiment and cause
I know there's 10,000 other strains out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can find, but I screw myself up every
time I go off rule seven and it's rule
[SPEAKER_00]: seven in particular, that, that particular
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's more than just the awesome
mean and the narrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something else in the mix in the
Royal seven and you're still trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what that is because it doesn't
always transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another, keep on talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another plant, uh, Hollywood pure
Kush that, so I say I have two mentors in
[SPEAKER_00]: this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't think they call me their
mentoree and they have no choice on me
[SPEAKER_00]: calling them their mentors, but that's
Kevin Jodhury and me and Gene from
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I love them unequivocally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they've just helped me so much to do
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, it's not just there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are multiple plants out there
that'll help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear Kevin tell the story through a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember, but it was about a guy
that had this disease where he hiccuped
[SPEAKER_00]: nonstop, you know, no, it started off that
he was at a dispensary, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were closing up shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody pulled in there in a wheelchair
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kevin sold him some of his personal
smoke because they'd already shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Hollywood pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy came back the next day and was like,
yo, that's the best I've felt in forever
[SPEAKER_00]: with my spasticity and shaking and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kevin gave me some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another other couple of people
tried it and the same work for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when me and you really linked up was
the Michigan regenerative conference up
[SPEAKER_00]: there three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kevin's telling the story at this
point, me and Kevin have a slight
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just cause I've flown out to Cal
fornia and tracked him down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he respected that while I like
this dude, I just saying, he's trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's put in work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I literally followed him around
the Emerald cup for an hour, for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't have the nerve to say anything to
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally he turned around and was like,
yo man, can I help you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled my shirt and I was like,
I got a port.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instantly he's like, I'm sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your video helped me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's all the research, my doctors and
nurses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to talk to you, you know,
and, uh, so Kevin tells a story about the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hollywood pure crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this guy pick up nonstop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean to where a business guy where he
couldn't even hold a conversation where
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd have to drink something, make himself
vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had like a 15 minutes and no
hiccups, you know, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm botching the story, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he tried the Hollywood pure push,
it fixed that for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I get a hold of Kevin,
I get the Hollywood pure push.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go out to California, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fly back on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some people have seen the
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flew right with it on, on the plane
because it mattered like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit helped with my shaking a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but when I tried to breed the
Hollywood pure push, even into the Royal
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to find either one of those things
together, like the best of both worlds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, because I take rule seven or
so and I'm going to hurts and by hurts the
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest ways to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have babesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take rule seven or so, and then it's
gonna, it's gonna like that is hurting
[SPEAKER_00]: this rash and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's killing off the parasites inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I have to flush the parasites out of
me, you know, and that's the J hooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's these micro parasites and bacteria
and everything inside of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kill them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get them out of you,
the doctor in DC explained to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: like when a mouse dies in your house,
like in a cabinet, um, it kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: rots and it'll discolor the wood and a
stink and like ammonia and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the parasites and stuff inside of you
kill them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't flush them out and they're
releasing chemicals and stuff inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: you, they're like polluting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making you hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're increasing your
inflammation, your joint pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the bacteria, the Lyme disease,
bacteria, uh, likes to attack soft tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes, brain, testicles, knee caps,
ankles, you know, like where there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of fluid in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so in with my brain injury,
sometimes like, like I'm going to lose
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what we were even talking about here,
but, um, uh, I have no clue what we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well then, so you were, you were talking
about how the fluid in your joints would
[SPEAKER_02]: hurt, especially with the hurts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting that out in file in following a
protocol, lemon water helps detox Epsom
[SPEAKER_00]: salts, ancient minerals, ancient salts are
a little bit better than just regular
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salts at CVS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as much fluids as I can drink a day,
all the mushrooms that I can take,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, coffee enemas doesn't sound fun,
but it will detox your body out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, anything that you can do to
help clean out the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the hurt scene, uh, from the pain
that's going like before you got here this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning, my first step when I wake up in
the morning, cause at night I take all
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I'm hurting out in the mornings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, first step is lemon water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, second step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I still got a port in my chest
that is connected into my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we either run fluids or I'm
riding the bathtub.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fluids help flush everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drink a lot of coffee in the morning and
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to make myself urinate as much
as I can't flush all this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a constant trick of detox.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do ozone treatment where they take my
blood, clean it, put pumping it back into
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hyperbaric chamber has been a game
changer for me and absolute game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the Lyme disease called a caused and
when I say Lyme disease and all of you
[SPEAKER_00]: always say this with me, a little Lyme
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Lyme disease is probably in remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the other parasites, but BC of
Barton, which BBC isn't like it's active
[SPEAKER_00]: right now on my chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's sometimes trying to figure out
which, which one of these things is trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to kill me, you know, today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but everybody always tries to send me
information about Lyme disease and I get
[SPEAKER_00]: that people are trying to help and I
don't, I don't mean this rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean like it's not about the Lyme
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what the parasites did while they
were tunneling around my body and
[SPEAKER_00]: tunneling in and out of muscles and
corkscrewing into bones and going out of
[SPEAKER_00]: soft tissue and everything that caused my
eating bar, my, my stiff man syndrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: my C5, C6, C7 vertebrae, you know,
my neurological conditions, all these
[SPEAKER_00]: weird diseases I have now that all come
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like even for me to be sitting out
here to do this interview, one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest issues is temperature regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just shift temperature of Michigan
like four or five days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have on two sweatshirts, two T-shirts,
two shirts, two pairs of pants and this
[SPEAKER_00]: big jacket, hood lamb jacket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my favorite jacket in the world
made out of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rated down to negative five degrees,
but it's also heavy and I need that weight
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a constant game of staying ahead
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it did to me more than anything
was retail on me mentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parasites running through my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the aggression, the rage you all can,
Google this if you wanted to, like there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a symptom called limerage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the poster child for limerage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't this way before I got bit by a
tick.
[SPEAKER_00]: My job was to train the most highly
protective, aggressive and working line
[SPEAKER_00]: German shepherds and mile walls to cap
that aggression, control that self,
[SPEAKER_00]: to work through it and to do all this
through offer conditioning, through
[SPEAKER_00]: skinnerism and theories of dog training
that wasn't based off force was based off
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching and learning and understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden these parasites
wreaking havoc through me and I couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: apply the own shit that I've always done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's been about a constant battle,
you know, of this summer alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think I had 11 surgeries since June
from brain all the way down into the tumor
[SPEAKER_00]: removals, you know, that has been caused
by Lyme disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping control of the mental illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've talked about this and I'm very
open about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said even inside, like, your posts on
social media have really changed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last five months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you're clearly, you're clearly more
upbeat in the last six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's funny when they tell you you're
going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do everything to not die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you always know it, but,
but once they lay it down for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, not, not today, you know,
not today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went through too much hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's not just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not special.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are half a million of us Lyme
disease patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yes, I'm, I'm, I'm weird in my
Powassan story, but there, there are so
[SPEAKER_00]: many of us with Lyme disease and so many
people undiagnosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would, that was the whole purpose of
us doing this to, to teach people how to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to help themselves when doctors won't
help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, all right, we're at, we're back after
a little break there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so I want to finish up with this
Nick, because so far you've been pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: clear about, um, you know, how you decided
that you, um, wanted to start focusing on
[SPEAKER_02]: using RSO for your Lyme support and then,
and then you're chasing the Royal,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Kush and then, and then realizing that
there's so much about that plant that's
[SPEAKER_02]: helping your Lyme disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you, then you started to go into
some of the other things that you were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think you've laid out the cannabis
stuff pretty well that we wanted to get
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know that you really believe in the
synergistic combination of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: for your endocannabinoid system with all
of these other traditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, traditional, um, like folk medicines,
um, that you really believe are working
[SPEAKER_02]: with the cannabis to better your
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like all of you in fighting the
Lyme disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figure since we're here, we should go
beyond just cannabis and talk about those
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, do you want, do you want to start
with the medicinal mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, my major issue, um,
outside of just the Lyme disease is that
[SPEAKER_00]: my brain swelled, um, I had a massive
brain infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, meningitis and cephalitis,
which caused all kinds of neurological
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, getting into a, like with
Dragonfly Earth medicine, we're Dempure
[SPEAKER_00]: here and, um, learning a little bit about
mycology and things from that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then following Paul Stamets and
getting into that to a, to a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: level, uh, Reishi, Chaga, Lyme's,
Mane, um, are all just some of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, every day that, that are mushrooms
that have to go back into my system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with my neurological,
um, helps with my speech patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've stuttered much during
this interview today, but there are days
[SPEAKER_00]: where, where I've even explained it to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be like, Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Scissors is here to visit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I call, I call Shannon Sarah or
Samantha or, uh, Stacey or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and she doesn't get mad at me because
I never dated a Sarah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just word association that I get
confused with the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Lyme's, Mane, Reishi, Chaga,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I'm leaving something out there,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, any of those medicinal mushrooms I
can take, I do Jaworks Farm, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: grows a lot of mushrooms and make some
stuff for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eclectic Alchemy, uh, uh, Healer,
uh, Herbalist make, make some stuff for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so mushrooms are a very major part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I micro dose, uh, 0.14 grams a day,
um, of psychedelic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help with the depression and the
sadness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for those that know me know that I
battle with, um, massive, uh, rage and
[SPEAKER_00]: suicidal ideations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, um, I'm not, uh, I'm not suicidal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even depressed right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me have 10 seizures today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just changes all the chemicals that are
going through my, my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that stuff has helped me
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's brought me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I, uh, if, if I had a seizure
right now, the first thing Shannon's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: is bringing me Turkey Tail and Chaga
Tintures, and then, then, um, CBD and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and all that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's not, and I say this to the
marijuana community, let's not downplay
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, you know, just because hemp,
we kind of looked at hemp as our ugly
[SPEAKER_00]: cousin and the hemp industry and all,
and CBD flooding the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was, and excuse my language,
but bullshit CBD sold in gas stations to
[SPEAKER_00]: people who were sick and couldn't afford
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 milligrams of CBD should not cost
69.95.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most people, and I believe the
CBD is, is mis-dosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are taking way too little.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take 500 milligrams of CBD a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, and I have went through this stuff
to find what levels like actually help
[SPEAKER_00]: after all these seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can experiment because I go through
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, taking a tincture of 13
milligrams CBD, a day is, is just not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that doesn't mean that you and your
particular cannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: that 13 milligrams wouldn't be enough of
CBD to bring that back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what doctors can't seem to figure
out about dosing this stuff is it's
[SPEAKER_00]: individual cannabinoid systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who years later,
like I don't get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just know, um, but you look at
Snoop Dogg who've been smoking all this
[SPEAKER_00]: week for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in a video and he's all like,
how the hell's he still, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: his cannabinoid system is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also not taking three or four grams
of RSO a day, which, um, I would like
[SPEAKER_00]: increases your tolerance, but even before
I was doing RSO, I always smoke like
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I was dog training and I just
didn't get a buzz like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Dr. Ethan Russo and different
people talk about taking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks and resetting the cannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my situation, I almost can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do skip RSO about once every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something to help it be more effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like any medication, the more you
take it, you build up tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take three to four grams of RSO every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is scary to somebody out there that
is hearing me say that it takes one single
[SPEAKER_00]: drop and feels drugged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to tighter that up to any patient
out there that's ever doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you take a drop and then the
next week you take two drops and the next
[SPEAKER_00]: week you take four drops and then you
double it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You double that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You double that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You double that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, and I agree for people who have
never that aren't a cannabinoid this user,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and then you have to give your
grandmother RSO and she's never had this
[SPEAKER_00]: before and she's sleeping 18 hours a day
and she's like, I hate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like this feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: For somebody who's never, you know,
had marijuana in, you know, drunkenness is
[SPEAKER_00]: almost what I call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is different than smoking or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like edibles times a billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to remember the medical benefits
that you are getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going through chemo,
if you're going through whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you need to sleep and recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body will adjust to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is scary in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is no different than the first time the
doctors give you a lower tab or a
[SPEAKER_00]: painkiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're really drugged up from,
but you start taking them and they lose
[SPEAKER_00]: their efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will build up on RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it's scary in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of patients talk to me that
have never been cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, I really don't like the
feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for me, I love the feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for cannabis users, they don't
understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love the feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But RSO can be hard when you're already
sick and now you're kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you never took RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like doing a mushroom treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's very psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power through, be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have food on hand when you start this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that in some places,
this is still a negative taboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is medicine, but we're losing
that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're way bigger on states that are than
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tell you to research how to make
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told Shango a story inside of the first
time that I made my own RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cooked down a quarter pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid $800 for this and I cried when I
was cooking it down because I was so
[SPEAKER_00]: scared I was going to ruin all this
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time I'm handing doctors so
many checks to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm in Kentucky not growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quarter pound of marijuana is nothing to
me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was everything to me then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes growers and producers and
processors need to remember this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quarter pound ain't nothing to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything to somebody in a one
bedroom apartment, partially out a check
[SPEAKER_00]: just to pay for their medicine and their
disabled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be compassionate caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of sick people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is very scary when you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very simple process.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can help you through that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the videos when you are
researching this on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned the hard way, like even trying
to find you all the goofy videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least people are trying and putting out
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: All instructions are not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how many people have liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how many subscribers they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have to become your own
healer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the medical system will forget
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't fit into their cookie cutter
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll forget you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point you've got to remember
yourself and you've got to fight for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very empowering to be your own
healer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very empowering that doctors still to
this day don't understand why I still keep
[SPEAKER_00]: staying alive even though I'm constantly
having all these surgeries and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the willingness to keep
researching.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try to find some semblance of my old
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just implore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many growers and breeders out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at your powder mildew resistant
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at your medical lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at your super strong stony lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got really stoned off this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you concentrate that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the life saver for somebody
who's battling chemo and needs to sleep or
[SPEAKER_00]: strong like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing how many of our THC rec
growers who have just been growing for
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke for years don't even have a lot of
basis in the medical side too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like flower growers who don't know how to
make RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it's something everybody
needs to have in their tool set.
[SPEAKER_00]: RSO is an antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we can make at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just having the research out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I've done all my research but I was
talking to you inside that I would still
[SPEAKER_00]: like to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes are the carrier for healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of my RSO, we're baking it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stripping it down with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm losing all my terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your house smells great though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I seal it in jars and put it in the
oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see the oil on the jars
when you bring it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get ice water hash, fresh frozen,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell all the terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: RSO all pretty much smells the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get differences there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm even trying to go deeper with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm figuring out how to decarb the ice
water hash properly to be able to just eat
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I experiment a lot with this stuff
because the terpenes are carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are a big part of the healing
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that's a big part of the
royal cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just like the sour, diesel-y,
purple-y, cush, Afghani mixture smell that
[SPEAKER_00]: you damn near find in nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that terpene profile really helps that
to go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raw juicing cannabis leaves, guys,
from the same powdery mildew-resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raw juicing flour tastes horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healing properties come from this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to get into a little bit of even
the root tech, making medicine out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots from the Rule 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just haven't stepped to that level
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making a salve out of the Rule 7 for the
issue that I've got on my chest or out of
[SPEAKER_00]: another powdery mildew-resistant strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always cautious when people are
like, well, I've got a strain that's
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew-resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you a good grower and you just
don't have powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, let me see it growing right
by a powdery mildew plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the first time you were at my
house, like two years ago, I stopped real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick and I said, yo, the flower room's
about to shut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta go spray everything down with
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, trying to create powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were like, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've ever heard anybody
trying to create powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, man, I'm trying to find the
strains that powers through that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My the wort this year, and I don't say it
because I bred it because I got my the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydra TKNL5 Haze Pam did horrible outdoors
with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wort, no bud rot, no powdery mildew,
pushed through the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Michigan, we had the wettest growth
season and the vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had days in August this year that were
50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next week it was eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant's taking that pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna break down a bunch of the
work in the RSO form.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have learned though now is to not
go off royal ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that a couple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything complements the Royal Kush 7
that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went off royal from December to June.
[SPEAKER_00]: July this year for personal reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went into other RSOs, different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I deteriorated so bad and I still didn't
just make the pair up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got back onto the royal in July about
the time that things were real bad then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling people goodbye, calling
people on the phone, telling them I love
[SPEAKER_00]: you and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got back on the royal and, oh lord,
I'm gonna get emotional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have came a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have came a long way and it's
because of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding Kevin Jodery and Me and Gene from
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then applying the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smack you upside the head with all
kinds of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't apply it, you're not gonna
get anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: How desperate are you to get better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is hope out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gotta find it, you gotta
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna be quick at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when I flew out to get that Royal 7
at Wonderland, I knew when I got home I
[SPEAKER_00]: had to veg it up for a few weeks,
take cuts, get it in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, the hope was real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's proved itself over and over to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, mental brought lives on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Ross Truth for creating that
string.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Emma Mountain for continuing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just because Royal 7 works that way
for me, and I do believe it'll work that
[SPEAKER_00]: way for you if you're battling Lyme
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe you have a different issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a brain injury from concussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're battling cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're battling whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to find strains that pair that
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look on the NIH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can research this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the strains that work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All marijuana is not created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some RSOs I will never take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love smoking the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The RSO isn't worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, to figure out that
information, you gotta go through trial
[SPEAKER_00]: and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that error can be very
costly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's on that point that I want to
finish up with you today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is this idea that you have shared
with us over this 40 minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: What has been a life's work for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it got way more intense three and
a half years ago, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you've gotten even more intense the
last three and a half years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of why you wanted to do this
video was because so many people contact
[SPEAKER_02]: you via Instagram and everywhere because
they hear that you're the guy who's using
[SPEAKER_02]: RSO to manage his Lyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to know why, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're doing this so that you can
just send them the link, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can hear your thoughts all at
once.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there are people who are
watching who are feeling like so
[SPEAKER_02]: overwhelmed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of all the information,
all the detail, people maybe who aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they don't even really know a lot
of the vocabulary they're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for these people, they're gonna have to
learn all of that to even do what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure that a lot of these folks are
overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'd like you to finish with is
real direct advice for the Lyme folks who
[SPEAKER_02]: are watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: What words of encouragement can you give
them about completing this what seems like
[SPEAKER_02]: an insurmountable task?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you are overcoming insurmountable
tasks just staying alive every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you've given a lot of
thought to it philosophically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what advice can you give folks about
just doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess a first thing is mental health
wise, you're a warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not just the Lyme folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the anybody sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're battling something that other
people around you do not understand and do
[SPEAKER_00]: not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep worrying on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's very difficult to say,
but take pride in the fact that you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're overcoming stuff that others
aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand this is overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off by looking at research,
Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, some of these things talk about
harsh chemicals, RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use alcohol to make RSO.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't use naphtha anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, we don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take that piece out, but you can go
to Rick Simpson's actual website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have good information, at least
starts the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be as overwhelmed with it,
realizing you're taking your life in your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands and you're creating your medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're scared when you do it at first,
start with a half ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it'll be a small wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody can help you if you're in a legal
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tons of videos on YouTube,
but you have to find the right ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very overwhelming and I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been through the whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to literally leave my home and
everything I was familiar with in Kentucky
[SPEAKER_00]: to move to Michigan to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a deep breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out to some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to go to the dispensary and
go ahead and get some from the right
[SPEAKER_00]: place, though I'm cautious about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was it grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's grown synthetically, all that
stuff is going to compound when it's made.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'm even going to make more issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a real caregiver in your area and
there are real ones everywhere and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just send people messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I did in the beginning,
even with you, different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to learn more and understand I get
tons of messages that I can't answer them
[SPEAKER_00]: all and I get overwhelmed by it,
but this is a step that maybe CBD can be
[SPEAKER_00]: the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: That at least starts building your
cannabinoid system is what I usually have
[SPEAKER_00]: people do for four or five days if they
never took cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will build the cannabinoid system and
activate it so that the first initial boom
[SPEAKER_00]: is not just knocking them out for 24 hours
or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get better and you have to be your
own fighter and hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to Shango inside that when I
got sick, I truly believed in the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor is going to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that case, especially if they
don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find people that can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lady named McCleck Calc when you
look her up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's herbalists and healers that can
help you through your journey to get
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can guide you because it's a lot from
the mushroom tech to the RSO to even
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing when to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend in the beginning for somebody
on RSO, take it right before you go to bed
[SPEAKER_00]: because if it's negative experience,
you're sleeping through most stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're going to wake up a little
hungover in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffee is your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep powering through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can help you, I'll try, but mine and
your focus always needs to be yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to help so many people with that
journey and then I left my own journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to remember that you're the
patient also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that would be what I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I used to say about
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't reiterate the first time I made
that RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally cried in the kitchen thinking,
I'm going to ruin all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: $800, I told you inside, it could have
been $80 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have replaced that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also say that to growers, be
compassionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hard to make RSO and get that to
people in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody should do that to an extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rode the wave of marijuana as medicine
to get it legalized everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now put your money where your mouth is to
help people out that are sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you because these podcasts
matter because without it, I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: never found Kevin Jody or Ming Jin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two continually try to keep me
alive, keep me mentally happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep me with right genetics, but it's
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found him, then I found them,
and people were willing to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: For Nick Rysden from Lime Rising Farm,
I'm Shango Lose from Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to walk you back and show you
the farm real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
All right.
