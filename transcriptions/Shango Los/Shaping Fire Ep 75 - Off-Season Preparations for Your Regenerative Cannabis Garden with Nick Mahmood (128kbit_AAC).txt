[SPEAKER_01]: For as long as humans have been farming,
farmers have had a relationship with the
[SPEAKER_01]: land that is intimate, mutually giving,
and high stakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers learn about their land by looking
at it and comparing it to other seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can touch the soil and trees and
fruit and mud and learn about its health.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sounds of the wind through the grasses
and the birdsong tell their own stories,
[SPEAKER_01]: and even taste the soil and water tells an
attuned farmer something about its makeup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever since humans started farming,
families and small communities have
[SPEAKER_01]: literally had their lives dependent on the
crops that were grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: A failed season could be financial ruin
and perhaps starvation and death.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, a successful season meant more
for everyone, paid off debts, and the joy
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes with physical security.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this human meaning coming from a
farmer's relationship with the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: During Prohibition, cannabis farmers had
to know their land and pray about the
[SPEAKER_01]: weather too, and they had the added threat
of law enforcement and helicopters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to provide for my family by growing
fields of cannabis while avoiding the DEA
[SPEAKER_01]: and National Guard overhead has got to be
one of the most stressful jobs I can
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at its heart, farming always comes
back to the land and the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: That essential relationship, that give and
take, demands an openness from the farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: and a willingness to do what the land
wants to keep her in balance and fertile.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis enthusiasts, we can all
benefit from remembering that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, and that flowers come from the
earth, and these flowers connect us to the
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts of farmers everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are all connected to their land,
their homes, their families, and our
[SPEAKER_01]: shared earth.

[SPEAKER_01]: Today, my guest is Nicholas Mamoud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicholas Mamoud and Elizabeth Luca Mamoud
founded Green Source Gardens in Wolf
[SPEAKER_01]: Creek, Oregon, where they produce cannabis
and food using regenerative farming
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were awarded the prestigious
Regenerative Cannabis Farming Award at
[SPEAKER_01]: both the Emerald Cup in California and at
the Cultivation Classic in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Source Gardens is a dragonfly earth
medicine, DEM certified regenerative farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are also certified by Kind,
Sun and Moon and are a watershed conscious
[SPEAKER_01]: property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick is a highly sought after speaker,
but he's hard to get because they live so
[SPEAKER_01]: far up the mountain and are nearly off
grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, Nick has spoken at Emerald Cup
and a few other key events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to discuss suggestions
for putting your garden to rest in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fall, opportunities for improvement over
the winter and some best practices for
[SPEAKER_01]: waking your farm up
[SPEAKER_01]: in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so grateful for finally getting to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for making time in your busy
schedule, especially, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so early in the morning today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at the end of the season,
so many of us just want to walk away from
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're tired and we're ready for a
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fall is a really great opportunity for
gains in a garden that's integrated with
[SPEAKER_01]: the nature that's surrounding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start there in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure as you are harvesting plants,
you're already planning what you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do as soon as everything is hung.
[SPEAKER_01]: So will you walk us along your process for
putting the garden to rest for the fall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it starts, it starts
basically in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it actually begins before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a preparation for harvest
is kind of it's preparing for harvest is
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning process of getting ready for
the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that I look at this is is when
people are when we're out harvesting these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, we're stepping on the soil around
the plants a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step that I'm taking that
we're taking is is mulching around the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants really heavy with wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason that we use wood
chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wood chips are kind of the most resilient
and soil protector, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you actually put wood chips on the
ground and then walk on those wood chips,
[SPEAKER_00]: it prevents compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also prepares the the surface of
the of the ground for the winter rains and
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to infiltrate water into the
ground, as well as once it starts to get
[SPEAKER_00]: wet again, all the microbiology that's
that's kind of maybe hidden down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil a little deeper in the late summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the dryness is able to work its
way back up to the surface and beyond into
[SPEAKER_00]: the new mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, really, if you want to
have your garden really well prepared for
[SPEAKER_00]: winter, you start in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I can't I can't emphasize
enough that people start their they think
[SPEAKER_00]: about their care preemptively before the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants to get away or like finish
a season and is it's really, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like big time of the year to want to stop
doing anything because all the work that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gone into the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, in order to really do a good
job, you have to think about the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to think about the weather that's
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to think about the weather that
exists now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to think about what happened all
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that happens in the summer
in a garden space that's irrigated is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of microbiology eats a lot of the
carbon mulch that is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, once that mulch is broken
down into more of a humus, it becomes more
[SPEAKER_00]: capable of being compacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's exactly why,
you know, you really want to like put all
[SPEAKER_00]: that heavy wood chip around your plants
before your workers are out there
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting on those plants so that their
footsteps aren't actually doing damage to
[SPEAKER_00]: the to the soil layer below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's that's the beginning
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are placing the wood chips,
how far out from the plants are you going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you are you putting them more at the
base because you're just trying to protect
[SPEAKER_01]: the the eight or 10 inches on either side
of the stock?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you all like, no, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: We heavily do the entire bed so that so
that it's more liberally protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you go so far as to wood chip the
aisle ways between the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know you see your soil as being
kind of one one comprehensive organism
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of like discrete parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's a it's all dependent on
the resource availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many wood chips do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much mulch availability do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can do the whole bed and the
pathway, that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more you can put on that time of
the year, the better, because what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at doing is, you know,
the the benefits of the wood chips at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time of the year are numerous and and
preparing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to think about things in terms of
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in southern Oregon and I'm thinking
about the winter and and the winter in
[SPEAKER_00]: southern Oregon is the wet season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, there's all this leaching
that goes on in that season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different where it freezes really
hard and the grounds frozen all all
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot less happens in that scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, the soil wakes up in southern
Oregon in the fall when it starts to get
[SPEAKER_00]: wet again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that microbiology has that
moisture to be able to start to do its
[SPEAKER_00]: work again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the wood chips are a
preparation to support the fungal growth
[SPEAKER_00]: for the winter time and the fungal
component and the hyphae and the mycelium
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically covers the the soil when
you wood chip heavy is the protectant
[SPEAKER_00]: layer that prevents leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fungal the the way the fungus works
is the mycelium encases all the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now when you run water through it,
the water doesn't carry anything away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the fungal component actually acts as
a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a way to keep the water
clean and to prevent leaching from
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the only way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have access to a lot of wood
chips, I live in a forested area where
[SPEAKER_00]: there needs to be massive amounts of
thinning going on anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we generally are able to find access to
good wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a case where, say, your fertility
is already really on point, you're in some
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural lands, you know, you might
choose the direction of just straight
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop in the winter where the the
root systems are acting as the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake and the protector of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case where I am, our fertility
is not very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in the mountains and on gravely
serpentine soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what I'm really doing still
even at year five is I want to promote the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of humus and continue building
fertility for years before I get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point where, say, I was down in the valley
bottom and all the silts get carried down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an endless depth of really
nutrient rich soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in my case, I am wood
chipping heavy for many different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it is prevention of
compaction and feeding the soil life and
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually aiming to acidify a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking at more acidic in the
winter and more bacterial in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, ultimately, there's always
both the bacteria or the alkaline and
[SPEAKER_00]: acidic, I guess, the two different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we can think about that
is fungally dominant soil support more
[SPEAKER_00]: acidic soils and bacterially dominated
soil support more alkaline soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to support a more acidic
soil in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we balance that in the spring
with the manures for the growth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question about wood chips would be,
you know, when I was at your property,
[SPEAKER_01]: your property has got more wood chips than
I've ever seen on a cannabis farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually on any farm period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that most of your stuff comes
from your the forest around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you were clear earlier when you said,
you know, if you have access to good
[SPEAKER_01]: chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in some ways, you're
probably like a chip guru, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so teach us a little bit about wood
chips and for and sourcing and choosing
[SPEAKER_01]: the kind of chip we're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the good thing about wood chips is
they're generally coming from tree
[SPEAKER_00]: companies who are doing either road work
or homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people don't spray their
trees very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes wood chips are actually
pretty clean in comparison to other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with people who are
doing a bunch of landscaping stuff on
[SPEAKER_00]: really, you know, managed landscapes,
then you have to be concerned about what
[SPEAKER_00]: people are are managing the landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: With in terms of chemicals and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in the case of gathering
from tree services who are working on
[SPEAKER_00]: roads and stuff, those wood chips are
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly recommend people search out
their tree companies and utilize those
[SPEAKER_00]: wood chips that way, because otherwise
they're oftentimes just being not not
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're they're being taken away
from the site in which they grew and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're being dumped in a place and all
heat together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not an efficient way to
maximize our carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's a lot of energy and
and and and gasoline and all the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that goes into even chipping wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I personally am not even
chipping that much wood off of my own
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just accessing the wood chips that's
already been processed in in these cert or
[SPEAKER_00]: these systems that exist that maybe aren't
the most efficient in terms of gas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to intercept these these
carbon streams that are being wasted and
[SPEAKER_00]: and put them back into good use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, honestly, wood chips
are probably the cheapest, most valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: input that you could ever put on your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of what a good wood chip is,
like everybody's always concerned,
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the question a lot about what type
of wood chips do you want to use and what
[SPEAKER_00]: type of trees are OK to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my my general answer for
most of these things is they're all good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're best when they're they're
diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, people are like,
well, the evergreen trees are too acidic
[SPEAKER_00]: and and all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some truth to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different chemistry and different
trees while they're living.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as they're dying and being consumed
back into the soil, they lose that
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even the things that are,
say, allopathic walnut trees and pecans
[SPEAKER_00]: are these kinds of things that prevent
things from growing doesn't mean that the
[SPEAKER_00]: wood chip breakdown is going to prevent
things from growing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just understand like old if you've got
wood chips that have been sitting around
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of years, it doesn't matter
what kind they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there is some truth to redwoods
prevent fungal growth, cedar prevents some
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if all you have is all redwood chips
or all cedar chips, you might just put
[SPEAKER_00]: those on the pathway and know that they're
going to take a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not support a certain component of
your soil as much as, say, like an oak
[SPEAKER_00]: tree or a maple tree or an alder tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deciduous trees in general might support
quicker saprophytic fungal breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diversity is always the aim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always looking for you don't want
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you wanted the best,
you would eliminate all the rest and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you would be down this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the path of monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the issue that I think this
culture faces is we're always trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the most efficient best thing that we
can because we care so much about having
[SPEAKER_00]: the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of mentality is the one that
takes you down this narrow path of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems because now you're eliminating
the diversity in the system and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: subjecting yourself to a really one sided
imbalanced scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even have to be from trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything breaks down the same.
Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no carbon that's better than other
carbon, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really appreciate you,
Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this every time I hear you
speak, whether it was the video we did
[SPEAKER_01]: together or or seeing you at Emerald Cup,
you have this wonderful way of taking what
[SPEAKER_01]: goes on on your garden and tying it
seamlessly into the systems around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you took that question and next thing
you know, you're talking about carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: streams that happen off of your property
and how to maximize them for the good of
[SPEAKER_01]: the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and then suddenly you're
like all the way back over here talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, you know, different seasonal soil
types, all while talking about what makes
[SPEAKER_01]: a good woodchip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that that holistic the
headspace of yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so when I originally asked the
question, I said, you know, what are you
[SPEAKER_01]: doing starting at Harvard?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, well, actually,
we start pre harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are and then we talked a lot about
woodchipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there anything else that you do pre
harvest that we want to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_01]: catch on before we go to the next time
block, which will be after harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a good time to gather up
the potatoes that are growing under and
[SPEAKER_00]: around and just to kind of either to store
them for eating and or to just break up
[SPEAKER_00]: the clumps of in groups of potatoes and
spread them out before the mulching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of replant your potatoes
at that time by by harvesting and
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading them out if you want them to
grow big again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave most tubers and stuff,
they form multiple many at the base of of
[SPEAKER_00]: where they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't harvest and spread them
out, they end up becoming smaller and
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller as the years progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have many more, but they're just
the the production is sacrificed a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit and they get overcrowded like most
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you just don't see those giant big
potatoes if you don't take the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: take those potatoes out and and spread
them about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you're going to be
spending a bunch of time pushing a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of wood chips onto the scene, pull your
potatoes out first, spread them out and
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch over those potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever do anything very
systematically like I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making a line of potatoes or I'm
literally pulling them out, pulling the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones I want to eat and then the ones that
are scarred or eaten by bugs to some
[SPEAKER_00]: degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just tossing into the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really even trying to place them
anywhere in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spreading some of the food crops out,
the tubers, that that might be one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really helpful right before the
mulching applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, yeah, you know, it's a good
time to throw cover crop seed on the areas
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't going to be as mulched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you if you have some extra seed
laying around or, you know, it's also a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time to look at what has seeded
itself in the garden and if you want that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff to grow in different places to cut
that down and just lay it where you want
[SPEAKER_00]: it to grow and that'll kind of increase
your desired cover crop potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you to be a huge fan of having
potatoes under your plants for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: For folks who haven't heard you talk about
this, why don't you hit on that briefly
[SPEAKER_01]: before we move on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's interesting and it's
something kind of unique to your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I mean, potatoes have fed the
world for so long that it's it's a worthy
[SPEAKER_00]: crop to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a tuber and tubers are doing
great things for the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not feeding just us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because they feed us these these
important starches and they give us a bank
[SPEAKER_00]: of food that you can basically source all
year long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also feeding the soil life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaving a bunch of potatoes in the
ground, it explodes your arthropod
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many times I pulled
up a rotten potato that was just heaving
[SPEAKER_00]: with with millipede life, like an
explosion of certain, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: biology that that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I look at it at the potato and it's
not just potatoes, tubers in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: but potatoes just generally seem to do
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our our growing scenarios,
I can't help but think that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: aiding and helping the cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potatoes have been one of our favorite
companion plants with cannabis since for
[SPEAKER_00]: for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I started honing in on that,
I just understanding potatoes is is an
[SPEAKER_00]: important piece of of having a secure food
system, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like when it comes down to
it, I eat more potatoes out of the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: than any other crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I consider it very valuable and a way
to make sure that I'm going to get through
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter if all the stores closed down
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a real dual use thing,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can eat them whenever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but also they're while being
respectful to the food, they're also not
[SPEAKER_01]: precious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also put them, you know,
in the ground to rot as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are doing an entirely different
precious job, not being food at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point, because they're being food for all
of the complex living things that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I like about
potatoes, too, is that it is nutrition
[SPEAKER_01]: that's accessible to multiple levels of
magnitude in your bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't just feed one level of
magnitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's whole, it feeds one group of
insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as it breaks down, it feeds all
the way down to the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got so much nutritional value,
it just seems to make the entire bed more
[SPEAKER_01]: abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the spring, when you leave the
potatoes in or they've overwintered and
[SPEAKER_00]: they start growing super early and they
freeze back and then they grow multi top,
[SPEAKER_00]: they become an amazing cover crop where
I'm actually having to destroy a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the vines when I'm transplanting things in
because there's just potatoes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good situation to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because I don't have to worry
about how many potatoes I'm going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got thousands of pounds in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever harvest them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the spring, I've got this beautiful
cover crop, vining green and potatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: three, four feet tall and five feet bush
like by June.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can harvest potatoes from June until
through the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a I can't I can't recommend
potatoes enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the best food crop that I know of
in terms of they don't eat that much in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting to me to hear you talk
about potatoes as a cover crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, I grew up in Detroit
and, you know, I think of potatoes as
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's under the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're like, no, man, in the in by
June, they have grown up out of the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've got these green tops and
they're producing all these other benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: that we normally, you know, just give to
radishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and honestly, they're they're they
cover the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you say cover crop, that's what
you're looking for is something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: acting as a living mulch layer that
protects the soil and and the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, again, but the potatoes
don't grow the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pull them all out and plant them
individually, they're much they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: not as vigorous and not as bush and cover
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to like exercise this
idea of planting way more than you want
[SPEAKER_00]: and leaving a bunch in and just watching
the process naturalize and then
[SPEAKER_00]: intervening only when things start taking
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's a lot of what I
believe is that you want the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: come back easily and naturally without
much work that serve a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: roles in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ideally, it's a it's it's it's
managing the overgrowth in a good garden
[SPEAKER_00]: versus trying to get stuff planted in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's it's really about it's
being the space is being overwhelmed by
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you just have to make room in that
overwhelmed space for your little plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to grow as a cash crop that
we do like for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really in at this point when I'm
transplanting in, I am making space in a
[SPEAKER_00]: very diverse and and and strong living
plant guild and just kind of just wrecking
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants in one area so I can get a
plant into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it bodes well for transplanting and it
makes things a little more challenging for
[SPEAKER_00]: direct seeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some pros and cons to most
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings us up to actual harvest,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's all stuff you're doing before
you're cutting your plants for the season,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's talk about your routines.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the plants are hung.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, let's start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the most important things and I
think is neglected most of the time is
[SPEAKER_00]: that that time just after harvest is
really the time that you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: building your potting soil for the next
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't buy any soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't buy amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't buy stuff to make our potting
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use everything from on site and wood
chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, wood chips aren't always from on
site, but our manures are on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy hay to bring to the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of things that we are
gathering off site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to like try and pretend we're
100 percent closed loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody is right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good to be vulnerable and
share the processes that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: our reality, which is we do have inputs
for our potting soils, but it's wood chips
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's manure and all the manure that we
get is from our own animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so we basically you want to get
that into a space that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: covered and and you want to layer that in
a way and to a size where it's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to heat up too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody's been brainwashed in in
this composting process to think that
[SPEAKER_00]: their compost has to get to 140 for a
certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of this stems from kind
of the organic certification stuff where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like if you're going to apply compost
to your crops, it needs to be having
[SPEAKER_00]: stayed at 140 for this long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what people overlook in that scenario
is that's only if you're adding that
[SPEAKER_00]: compost to the crop before or within 90
days of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not putting that,
you can put manure directly on your
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not an issue as long as you have
90 days of growth before that crop is
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we want to do is prevent
thermophilic composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to prevent the heating of these
piles to 140.
[SPEAKER_00]: I aim for a range from 80 to 100,
and I try never to get that much more
[SPEAKER_00]: above 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that is the
that is the temperatures in which
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology is most active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I'm looking for as much
microbiological breakdown while
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining and retaining all the
nutrients of the stuff being processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cold composting actually puts and keeps
the carbon in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot composting, you lose your nutrients to
the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to put the carbon back in the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're not trying to do as say
this term regenerative that seeks to put
[SPEAKER_00]: more carbon in the ground than it takes
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the potting soil is done in our hoop
houses, which were previously had grown
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do a lot of breeding in the hoop
houses there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those all get cut down and then
everything comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I build this this what looks like a
berm inside of my hoop houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the berms that I manage
through the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: To biologically break down and become
stable, well broken down humus that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: potting soil for the springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it's important for that to be
covered by something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the rains and the weather
to be working on that pile because you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be adding the moisture and
reducing the amount of leaching and making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that that process is happening in the
right way so that in the springtime you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a really good medium for sprouting
seeds without running into a lot of say
[SPEAKER_00]: damping off and issues that come with
things that are less processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having more fungal stuff going on and
damping off is one of those things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to pay attention to with your
especially your sprouting soil mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much transplanting once the plants
a little bit older it can take some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not trying to create compost
piles that are going to cook and you are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually more relying on time over the
course of the winter for the manure to age
[SPEAKER_01]: and for the compost to increase in microbe
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that your thoughts about the
inputs would be different too if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not trying to get to 140.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just guess that you're using
everything that you find on the farm and
[SPEAKER_01]: just creating lasagna.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe talk a little bit about what
these piles consists of other than the
[SPEAKER_01]: manure that you've already hit on.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost whenever you're making
a compost pile really that bottom layer
[SPEAKER_00]: should be the fattest chunkiest stuff
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wood chips is always a great base
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got a bunch of branches that
are smaller twig like branches that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what that does is it creates
this sponge for the more nutrient rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do do like the lasagna layer
just because it's kind of like I can
[SPEAKER_00]: manage the manures the wood chips the
forest matter and put them in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any time you're creating or building
soil of any sort this isn't just about
[SPEAKER_00]: compost even though everything is getting
composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just in general you want to build a
bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do things where you're
maximizing all the potential of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're putting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your biggest most lignin rich
source of carbon at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want rich nutrient dense stuff
that's going to soak that carbon because
[SPEAKER_00]: that carbon wants to suck all that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That carbon wants to hold all those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people talk about wood chips
tying up nitrogen or saying it makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen not available there's some truth
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to look at the benefits of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the wood chip pulls that energy into
it now you have a much better food source
[SPEAKER_00]: for the biology because it's not just what
the wood chip was but now it's this
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient rich tea that has naturally
infused itself into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the fungus grows it actually grows
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start with your wood chips on the
bottom and then a layer of manure a layer
[SPEAKER_00]: of forest leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the most diverse areas usually the
gulches in my area where the horsetail and
[SPEAKER_00]: the big leaf maples and the alder and the
oak are all kind of close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I gather the leaves I'm getting a
diverse mix of forest matter and really
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what you want is that diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't highly recommend people go out and
just start hacking away into the forest
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and start bringing that because
unless you're bringing something to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's kind of just this taking from a
place and it's actually maybe not that
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful to the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when gathering materials from the
forest you want to look at where materials
[SPEAKER_00]: gather the most easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are deposited with the water or they
fall and the wind blows them into this
[SPEAKER_00]: area and you want to be taking from these
basically forest matter deposits that
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally occur and that way you know it's
going to replenish in that spot over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over and it's not necessarily you going
out and finding the best forest soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can and starting to dig into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really just kind of gently raking as
much leaf matter and oftentimes my forest
[SPEAKER_00]: matter that goes into my potting soil is
me cleaning up our access roads where all
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves and pine needles and that kind
of stuff are and I need to clean that
[SPEAKER_00]: because we need to be able to get up those
roads in the winter to get to the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really you know it's kind of a great
system in that you know we're keeping the
[SPEAKER_00]: roads able to be used there but we're also
getting all that energy that would
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally just turn into muck on the roads
into a potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your woody carbon,
carbonaceous layer, you've got a layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: manure to soak into that and then you've
got a layer of these forest leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you might wood chip manure but you
don't the biggest piece of keeping things
[SPEAKER_00]: from getting too hot is how big of a heap
you make.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the bigger the heap with the same
materials added will get to 140 but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping this in a long smaller heap and
I'm with a temperature gauge just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: watching how the temperatures increase and
rise and if it starts to get too hot I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of opening it up and spreading it out
just a little bit to prevent that from
[SPEAKER_00]: getting as hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know the more you heap things up
generally the hotter they get and quantity
[SPEAKER_00]: is oftentimes the factor that kind of
gauges what the temperature is.
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know if I could make the same pile
and if I added three times as much I might
[SPEAKER_00]: be thermophilic composting but you know
the other great thing about doing this in
[SPEAKER_00]: in my hoop houses is the hoop houses serve
as the nursery and so when I'm filling
[SPEAKER_00]: pots to do nursery work it's always from
the ground it's just from right where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: standing and so it's really efficient from
a working standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not moving soil very far all the work
has been done in the fall and now I just
[SPEAKER_00]: have my system dialed there and and I have
potting soil to scrape up off the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's real basic it's not that
complicated I'm not putting any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like intensive inputs outside of the
manure to add nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if I know the soil is naturally
low in calcium I might try to shoot for
[SPEAKER_00]: more oak leaves because I know that oak is
a calcium accumulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of factors there's a lot
of thought processes there's no right way
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no wrong way there's just ways and
and the way that I do it is is I spent a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of time thinking about it and I just
do what makes the most sense and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to nobody needs I don't mean
for it to sound like this is how you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it it's just that there are some
things to consider like you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose everything to the atmosphere because
that's truly what we're trying to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get a much more stable end result
when your biology has been supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thermophilic composting supports
pasteurization it heats up to a point
[SPEAKER_00]: where it kills everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people mostly want because
they want to be killing the weed seeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds that they don't want but you
know I embrace all those components as a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the living system and I'm not
trying to kill and pasteurize seeds and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't worry about pathogens in that
scenario as long as the biology is strong
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to have done the work for a long
enough period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't run into a whole lot of pathogen
problems especially as the years roll by
[SPEAKER_00]: and the soil building has occurred in the
same place over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on that's a great explanation Nick I
especially like your idea that this is not
[SPEAKER_01]: the way there are many ways and when when
you talk about it you can hear the
[SPEAKER_01]: reasoning behind what you're doing so
farmers who are listening to this anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: on the planet can go oh okay I understand
how he's thinking about it and for me and
[SPEAKER_01]: the the plants and inputs that I've got
where I have where I am and the types of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil I have I can go through these same
sorts of thought processes and make a
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative solution that works locally
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now before we go on to the the rest of
your your after-harvest process and move
[SPEAKER_01]: into winter let's go ahead and take our
first short break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is regenerative farmer and
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicholas Mahmood of Green Source Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_01]: educated it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plant industry and today many
cannabis cultivators are moving from
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays and chemicals to beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copert biological systems has the
beneficial insects mites and nematodes
[SPEAKER_01]: microbials sticky cards and air
distribution units you need to partner
[SPEAKER_01]: with nature to defend your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home Copert is
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to help answer your questions and
help you transition away from chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays towards clean and natural
solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1967 Copert has assisted growers in
identifying pests and devising reliable
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions while providing healthy insects
and mites that will protect your yield.

[SPEAKER_01]: Oxygen is an essential plant nutrient and
keeping sufficient dissolved oxygen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaia's brand of ultra fine nanobubble
systems will help your garden thrive in
[SPEAKER_01]: ways you may not have considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter if you grow in soil hydroponics
or aquaponics Gaia's ultra fine nanobubble
[SPEAKER_01]: systems will increase your dissolved
oxygen and increase your yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often the first sign of inadequate oxygen
supply to the roots is wilting of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant under warm conditions and high light
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insufficient oxygen results in an
accumulation of toxins and an insufficient
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of water and mineral absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: If oxygen starvation continues mineral
deficiencies will begin to show roots die
[SPEAKER_01]: back and plants will become stunted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Healthy roots supplied with sufficient
oxygen are able to absorb nutrient ions
[SPEAKER_01]: selectively from the surrounding solution
as required.
[SPEAKER_01]: In studies this has shown a 30% increase
in plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do ultra fine oxygen bubbles
allow your plants to thrive but they will
[SPEAKER_01]: keep your drip lines and irrigation pipes
and plumbing clean too because algae,
[SPEAKER_01]: pythium and other invasive species only
survive in low oxygen environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Gaia system only costs about two
dollars per day to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaia ultra fine oxygen nanobubblers are
also great for making compost teas and
[SPEAKER_01]: wild crafted nutrient teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smaller bubbles of truly dissolved
oxygen allow more microbes to reproduce
[SPEAKER_01]: faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Gaia's website at h205.com to learn
more about using dissolved oxygen and how
[SPEAKER_01]: to purchase this simple yet amazing
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's h205.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the national hemp program in flux due
to stringent THC testing requirements,
[SPEAKER_01]: brother Seth and Eric Crawford continue to
release seeds to hemp farmers that will be
[SPEAKER_01]: legal no matter how you grow them or when
you test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These new varieties from Oregon CBD seeds
have substantial amounts of CBDV,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBGV, CBCV and THCV while always staying
below the 0.3% THC limit and guaranteeing
[SPEAKER_01]: complying crops for farmers every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, these new varieties cannot be
pollinated by your neighbor's uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen or a rogue male in your own crop
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD seeds are non-GMO certified
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD seeds was founded and funded in
2015 by Seth and Eric maxing out their
[SPEAKER_01]: personal credit cards without outside
investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They continue to refuse outside investment
that would change their company culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD grows tons of fresh food on
their research farms for local food banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally tons of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also give away tens of thousands of
pounds of R&D flour to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: As their company began to succeed,
Seth and Eric started donating money to
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause
too by giving millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon State University in order to
establish the world's leading cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics research program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they treat their employees right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD pays for full health and dental
coverage for their employees, a 401k
[SPEAKER_01]: program and their minimum starting wage is
20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus everyone shares food from the farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth has been on shaping fire a few times
to talk about novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check out episodes 25 and 37 on
CBD cultivars in the hemp market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 66 on triploid cannabis genetics
and the very first shaping fire live
[SPEAKER_01]: episode 47 with Seth and soil expert,
Jeff Lowenfels talking about auto flowers.

[SPEAKER_01]: buying seeds for the 2021 season.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's oregoncbdseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Lowes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is regenerative
farmer, Nicholas Mahmood of Green Source
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we were talking about
the late fall after harvest preparations
[SPEAKER_01]: that you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've talked a lot about wood chips,
influencing the quality of the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: the building of the type of compost pile
that you most like to prepare your potting
[SPEAKER_01]: soil for the following season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else that we want to
talk about putting the property to bed
[SPEAKER_01]: before we move into winter and forest
management and stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's just really important
that the soils all get covered,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're thinking about your tubers and
stuff spreading out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking about what you want it to
look like the next season, and you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of managing whatever perennial stuff
you got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that varies between the different
plants that are perennialized in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the important things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we can move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, we're getting later in
the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're into November, December,
depending on where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rains have begun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the temperatures have dropped
significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heck, if you're at high enough elevation,
you might be thinking about snow at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my head, I'm usually thinking,
all right, this is the time that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be in the house in front of your
fireplace with your family and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: your celebratory flower from the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, you are outside taking care of
things on your property that really are
[SPEAKER_01]: best done when you don't have more
pressing things to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take us through what you're doing
during doing during the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing, I like to think about a
big picture ecological perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not always 100% focused on the
garden, but I'm paying attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding landscape and trying to do my
best as a steward to maximize what I can
[SPEAKER_00]: do in the right seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the winter time, as the moisture comes
back into the system and the weather
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to permit the ability to start
working on forest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, we rely on wood for heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the winter, we have an 80-acre farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only grow on a small portion of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just in this really overgrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is common in most of managed forests
in the West is that these management
[SPEAKER_00]: practices have been seeking production
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our forest lands are actually farms for
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that process, we've overlooked the
potential ecological health of the system
[SPEAKER_00]: to maximize profit for logging companies
and just for the land's sake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And completely just are doing terrible
things in the long run for the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: of the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the winter time for me has been a
lot about looking at thinning the land
[SPEAKER_00]: that are overgrown and maintaining the
larger trees on the landscape and cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: down the overgrown understory of trees
that are just choking everything out and
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming a serious fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so winter time is a thinning time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big part of the work that is
going to go down is once the fire season
[SPEAKER_00]: is over, I'm thinking about the next fire
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking about how to get the
landscape into a position where if a fire
[SPEAKER_00]: did roll through, it wouldn't be
detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: But rather maybe even a little bit
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so truthfully, the forests have been
managed by indigenous peoples in the West
[SPEAKER_00]: for longer than we can understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to think that there's this you have to
leave nature alone in order for nature to
[SPEAKER_00]: be at its peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth is, is humans are a part of
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're trying to understand our
relationship to the ecology as a species
[SPEAKER_00]: of participating members in the ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look to what do we do,
we should be sourcing the indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: practices of the area to best promote the
ecological health of the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are participating steward of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that looks like is managing
overgrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, there's written things about
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's this idea that there's this
principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget the full on thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the gist of it is that there's a lot
of things out there that if left unchecked
[SPEAKER_00]: will just take over, diminish diversity,
and reduce the potential of the ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's humans that can come in and help
manage that for the diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think about health in a
forest, we're thinking about layers within
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're thinking about light
penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're thinking about canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're thinking about fire breaks that
impede the ability for fires to be
[SPEAKER_00]: devastational.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're really immature in our
understanding, even just us being myself
[SPEAKER_00]: and my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And landowners in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at this time in the world where the
land hasn't been cared for that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the culture that we come from doesn't
understand what care really looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to begin the process of
healing that and repairing some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: harm that's been done, we really have to
look at things from an ecological big
[SPEAKER_00]: picture perspective and understand that a
healthy forest is one that has big trees
[SPEAKER_00]: that are spaced apart with a bunch of
different brush growing underneath and
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses that can grow and light
penetration that can promote the diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: and vines growing into the trees and
enough space in between the trees for fire
[SPEAKER_00]: not to just wreak havoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm spending a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting the process of burning more
just because the scenario is so intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through a process where I thought,
well, we don't want to burn anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to sequester that carbon into the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is the state of the forest
and where they're at in this state of the
[SPEAKER_00]: danger of the fires is there's a lot of
burning of brush and stuff that does need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could chip it all, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth is we don't all have
chippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much gas would it take to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thinking about fire breaks and
working on your forest fire breaks and
[SPEAKER_00]: what that also does is it increases the
light penetration, which increases the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential ground growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we like to thin spaces strategically
surrounding the homes, surrounding our
[SPEAKER_00]: most valuable resources, and then start
the process of getting the ground prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to grow more than just,
say, all cedar trees and hopefully try to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the diversity on the ground level
as well as the canopy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then introducing animals to that once
that's been done really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're in the early stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really move slow in making these big
decisions because I really understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from a broken culture when we talk
about stewardship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I try to just not be too hasty and
think I have the answers right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I implement small scale and watch and
observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ask myself, as honestly and
openly as I can, was that a good thing for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Earth and this area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was that just me practicing something I
thought was good based on my cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: brainwashing, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important, I think,
that we think about things and be really
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful and really have foundational
principles of what are we trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve before taking action into the
landscape and implementing our ideas upon
[SPEAKER_00]: the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always think about the farm design
shouldn't be designed by people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be designed by the land that
it's in and that people are just simply
[SPEAKER_00]: able to understand how the land is working
and promote the healthiest potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: that space versus I want straight rows of
this and I want my square block of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like nature doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want to pay attention to is how
does the water move across the landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: What harm has been done previously?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we remediate some of that harm?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we increase subsurface return flow
to the creeks and gulches?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we hold the moisture in the
landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we want to be thinking
about as we're doing these thinning
[SPEAKER_00]: projects because if we do, say,
disturb the land in a way where we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to bury some wood, we want to do
that on contour where the water then
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltrates and where the wood gets soaked
and it doesn't just stay on the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: and get dry, but rather it turns into a
fungal thing that's all duffy and isn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't burn everything, but I also
don't bury everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of thinking going on,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do spend time around the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am inside as well, and I am enjoying
that flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we've talked about watersheds
before and how the water moves across your
[SPEAKER_01]: land, you've talked to me about how you
just go in and move a berm or move a swale
[SPEAKER_01]: or you're physical about your relationship
with the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many times I tour farms and folks
don't want to move, they don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: move the growing beds and other things on
their property because they feel attached
[SPEAKER_01]: to where they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your approach is always the water flow
changes from year to year on your
[SPEAKER_01]: property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so during the winter, you often will
reorganize the farm and where your growing
[SPEAKER_01]: spaces are based on how nature is
presenting itself on your property this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you talk a little bit about your
willingness to kind of mess with last
[SPEAKER_01]: year's garden and remake it into this
year's garden, keeping in mind what nature
[SPEAKER_01]: is telling you it wants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question and a great topic
because so much in the regenerative realm
[SPEAKER_00]: and the better practices we talk about,
no till.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sometimes that I use that term
a lot in the past, no till.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a great reason we glom on that
and why that is so important is because
[SPEAKER_00]: undisturbed communities that are allowed
to mature become more mature and are able
[SPEAKER_00]: to evolve into a more resilient system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's some parts of it that are a
little off too as I evolve in my thought
[SPEAKER_00]: processes about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a system becomes more mature and
evolved, sometimes disturbance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that doesn't mean tilling,
but I think about disturbance can
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes stimulate and allow the
diversity to recreate itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I basically am looking at all the
things I did wrong earlier in my time as
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who is claiming to practice
stewardship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at where I didn't say form
things in the way where the water was
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltrating at the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go and I will disturb that space and
sometimes even with a machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but only, that takes a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot for me to feel like I can
get behind a machine and start working on
[SPEAKER_00]: a landscape and thinking I'm doing any
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, people make big mistakes on
machines really quick and that's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: recoup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you start to get an eye for it and
you start to see where maybe some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: places where it wasn't fully on contour,
you can remediate by shifting things
[SPEAKER_00]: around and allowing the water to then
become more able to return to the water
[SPEAKER_00]: table subsurface versus seeing water
draining off of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always trying to create these sinks,
these places where the water sinks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understanding contour is really
important for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did everything on our hillside by
hand the first couple of seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after really getting to know the
land a little more, we started to use a
[SPEAKER_00]: machine in there just to really help
stimulate and promote that potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I don't say don't ever
disturb anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say once your system has become healthy,
a little disturbance here and there is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a pretty good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It resets some ecological activity,
which means that you're recreating some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that might not exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, you're creating that again in a
system that's mature and now the diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: is even greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, we're seeking for that
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a place where I can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have an annual crop amongst a
perennial system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the beds this year,
I've taken and doubled some of them up and
[SPEAKER_00]: made the berms even bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they'll be more productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I'll be able to sink more water
in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any time you do go in and disturb
things, you've got to understand that when
[SPEAKER_00]: you do disturb land, you are breaking it
down and creating it to be more subject to
[SPEAKER_00]: erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so any time you make a move in that
direction, you have to be prepared with
[SPEAKER_00]: either mulch or cover crop seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timing has to be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't work in machines on wet land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be really mindful of how you
go about your disturbance to minimize the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential negative impact that you can
certainly have without meaning to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people have a lot of
negative impact trying to do good things,
[SPEAKER_00]: just doing them out of tune with how they
should be done from an ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually that's like the whole nine to
five schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't work on a nine to five schedule
and say, I'm going to block out this week
[SPEAKER_00]: to do machine work and I'm going to take
this time to do this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be flexible with the climate
and the cycles of the cosmos in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the most effective participant in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wait for dry periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a short window of work period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can actually put a machine on the hill
without really screwing up the hill and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe losing traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can track on the excavator because of
the mud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you have to be very mindful
how we operate, especially on a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: scale and our impact, and just make sure
that we're doing all the pre-planning and
[SPEAKER_00]: staging of materials to heal that space
once we do disturb it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because regardless of how mature and
evolved the system is, how resilient it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, any time we do make big disturbance in
a space, we have to come in with a soft
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing touch that allows the
reestablishment of the life that we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue to be maximized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we finish up the winter cycle,
I'm curious if you are spending any time
[SPEAKER_01]: producing your own inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you fermenting foliars or producing
any additives on your property?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk more about manure in
the next set, but I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically like fermentations or
nutrient teas or anything, Korean natural
[SPEAKER_01]: farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do any of that kind of stuff during
the winter and how do you see those
[SPEAKER_01]: playing a role on your farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't see them from a conventional
mindset of what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't practice any of that stuff,
but I see them playing a role in the
[SPEAKER_00]: systems I've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the fermenting going on,
but I don't actively separate the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I want fermented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really all this takes place in the
rhizosphere and the mulches that are
[SPEAKER_00]: applied are the actual fermenting,
the teas that when the rain falls on these
[SPEAKER_00]: mulches, they create teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fermenting happens in the different
microbiology and the different
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures of the organic matters that
are accumulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make sense from a production
standpoint if you don't have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: separating things, putting them in vats,
creating infrastructure for these
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that are maybe not fully
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's ways you can go about these
things where it's happening and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually not doing the work of making it
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to think about setting up the
foundation of things so that those
[SPEAKER_00]: processes certainly are occurring,
but it's not me that's in control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that answer a lot, Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the answer that I thought I was
going to get out of you, but you're so
[SPEAKER_01]: continually not hype that I like the fact
that you're like, man, I don't need to do
[SPEAKER_01]: all this fermentation stuff in the off
season because it's all happening in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you look at labor and time and
these kinds of things, it costs money to
[SPEAKER_00]: create those systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to make it in a farming
business, you really have to have a low
[SPEAKER_00]: overhead and you really have to be
efficient in your production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to have a barrel here and do I
want to go gather this and put it in here
[SPEAKER_00]: and stir it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too big of a scale to try and do that
for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe they don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're all very functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're tried and true in a lot of
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with the foundational principles
of gathering indigenous microorganisms and
[SPEAKER_00]: I know about it all, but do I practice it
in physicality as a person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, I just see it happening all around me
and I try to stack my resources into
[SPEAKER_00]: positions where I don't have to be in
control of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if a lot of those processes of
fermentation are meant to incubate
[SPEAKER_01]: indigenous microorganisms, essentially
everything we have talked about today is
[SPEAKER_01]: incubating indigenous local microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that you are doing that right
there in the soil instead of taking them
[SPEAKER_01]: away from the environment, incubating them
and bringing them back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no question that you are
multiplying your local healthy microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: and bacteria and fungi and all that kind
of stuff just through these processes,
[SPEAKER_01]: just in a way that's happening under a
thick layer of wood chip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, wood chips, leaves, whatever's
laying around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great explanation, Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's go ahead and take our
second short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is regenerative farmer,
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicholas Mahmood of Green Source Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the topics I want to share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has follow-up
posts to Shaping Fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shango Lowe's Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours.
[SPEAKER_01]: My successes and failures in my own
garden, insights and best practices from
[SPEAKER_01]: personal grows everywhere, and always
gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Lowe's and join our
[SPEAKER_01]: online community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_01]: loyalty in the customers you already have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_01]: it and you're not ready to hire somebody
full-time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you, I recommend blunt branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: At blunt branding, Kirsten Nelson and her
team are focused on improving your bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_01]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_01]: most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_01]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_01]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_01]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals and humbled at
[SPEAKER_01]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_01]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_01]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_01]: on results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, every single friend I have
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_01]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_01]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_01]: while using cutting-edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_01]: of this easy, automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is regenerative farmer,
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicholas Mahmood of Green Source Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are back at the springtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took us all this good, honest effort
over the fall and winter, all so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the best position we can be on our
property for this time when we are pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden together and setting it off for
the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Nick, what are you doing as nature is
starting to wake up and there's starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to be buds on trees and you're starting to
see like baby animals and all this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff early in the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing so that your garden can
be in the best way possible to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: eventual beautiful flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, you know, springtime is an
important time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, everybody's climate is going to
dictate their practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really am aiming to work with the
climate in the best way possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, our manures that are in the
barn all winter under preventing from
[SPEAKER_00]: being leached and being gathered
continually, you know, we feed our animals
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty heavy in the barn space to keep the
manures accessible to us so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: have a big pile to source from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start putting the manure on the garden
in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, honestly, everything we do
on the farm, because there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe this is a good time to explain like
how many people are actually working with
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that many.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every process that we go down,
my wife, my brother has been working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one employee, Jessie,
and then, you know, the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't do any labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, what we're doing never
happens that quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting the manure on the field only
starts in March because I can't do it all
[SPEAKER_00]: at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it starts in March and it ends in
June.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really takes months of pushing,
of gathering the manure into a truck and
[SPEAKER_00]: then moving it up to the space,
then wheelbarrowing it out into the space
[SPEAKER_00]: where we want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this is a good time to just explain
why we wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think a lot of people put a lot
of manure on their yards in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, again, could be a fine practice
in an area where it freezes hard all
[SPEAKER_00]: winter and everything gets locked up and
then doesn't even start its process of
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down until it warms up in the
springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in our climate, it rains and it's wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it rarely freezes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we lose a lot in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the manure is protected all
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wait till the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that manure is also going to be
bacterially dominant in its breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a fungally supported
network that's really rich in fungus up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the hillside from the winter of wood
chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what we do is we just,
where we want the cannabis to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: we wheelbarrow loads of manure onto the
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that prevents things from growing
there so that we have a clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: easy spot to transplant things into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also balances the bacterial fungal
component and starts to create a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient-rich space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, we do this all the way to
June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even beyond, in some cases,
depending on when harvest time,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to always aim for no manure
from the barn on the space if we're within
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 days of a harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just good to keep in mind,
especially from a commercial perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be adhering to some of the important
components that you could be dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: from a problematic place of authority
saying you did things wrong, which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, so the manure starts to get put
onto the field slowly and surely into the
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces that we want to transplant into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's prepping that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perennials are being divided in the early
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the daisies are going to get broken
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to expand those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to put comfrey into places that
are new, we'll go ahead and break up some
[SPEAKER_00]: roots and move them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the perennial stuff is just mindful
perennial management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the most important thing spring
is the nursery work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for us, we depend on a good
nursery for transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier for counting, for tagging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this legal system that makes us
just belligerently over tag everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially bring a bunch of garbage
into the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully they'll stop making us use
these metric tags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear that metric tags are the biggest
amount of garbage I have on our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that is no longer an issue
once things are mellowed out a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: on tracking everything because it's kind
of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the nursery work is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about the composting for the
potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we didn't mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's turned about four or five times in
the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's added to throughout the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a bunch of the cannabis gets
trimmed up at the shop, all the stems come
[SPEAKER_00]: back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go into the potting soil again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's also layers of stems that end
up in our potting soil to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: rejuvenate exactly what the cannabis plant
wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the springtime in March,
when we do start our first round in the
[SPEAKER_00]: second quarter moon cycle in March,
what I'll do is I'll do a hot compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll block off one part of the hoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll layer a bunch and get the heat way up
in that compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know that it's losing energy to
the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm utilizing the compost as a heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put the tables over that compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that heat is pretty good for a couple
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that if I just wait to the very
end before I start popping my seeds and I
[SPEAKER_00]: heap all this stuff in there and I get
that temperature to like 140 or even more,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking advantage of a naturally
breaking down system to heat the space
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some supplemental heat involved
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we try to reduce that as much as
possible with this process of creating the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat in the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need it for that March round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's a smaller round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep a smaller space heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easier to heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But April is really the round for big
amounts of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nursery is in the hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's double-tented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has some supplemental heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until May, when the temperatures are
easily warm enough to not need that over
[SPEAKER_00]: the nighttime temps to maintain a certain
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're planting some rounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all the soil that we're sourcing is
right at our feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the filling of pots for transplanting
is all right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting things in flats so I can
start hundreds of seeds in a three foot
[SPEAKER_00]: square.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm transplanting into four inch
until they become established.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm transplanting up into two to
three gallon pots until they sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that process usually takes a month
and a half to two months if all the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing conditions are adequate for
vigorous growth in that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick, let's hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still thinking about your answer to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring them pot up, pot up,
pot up, and into these three gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put them there until they
show sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what exactly are you saying there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you saying that they're in these three
gallons until the end of July?
[SPEAKER_01]: The beginning of August when they're
starting to flower show sex?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you mean that you are determining
sex in veg or that you are taking clones
[SPEAKER_01]: and flowering somewhere else and then
using those as your canary of what sex
[SPEAKER_01]: these particular clones are gonna be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Break that out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, first of all, we never clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that eliminates that potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are sexing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, most genetics, especially when
started earlier in the spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: will show a pre-flower at one and a half
months to two months if the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some genetics that are super
stubborn to show their sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a good eye for sexing plants
when they're young.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a trained eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it for other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly don't get every single one
dialed perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, 95% of what's going down
is pre-sexed in a veg state once it's
[SPEAKER_00]: matured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you will see a pre-flower on most
genetics given that circumstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the march round, the earlier
stuff you start, we also don't use any
[SPEAKER_00]: light manipulations of any sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually start some genetics
in, say, March and they will go into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can hard prune them as the
daylight is lengthening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can guarantee that it's female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to crown out and wanting to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do this insane cut back to a
couple nodes and it stunts it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it starts to regrow, now the
daytime length is long enough to stimulate
[SPEAKER_00]: the veg growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it regrows into more of a bush-like
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a technique that I wouldn't say you
should do on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it certainly works well for some
plants that tend to go in and out of veg
[SPEAKER_00]: and flower easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some genetics just will not come out of
that phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have a stunted plants for
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be disappointed if you start
things too early and they flower too hard
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, even if I start things in
May and they're in full veg, some genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: will just show that pre-flower once
they're mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a real easy thing to see when you
have an eye for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to know where to look and you
have to be having seen it a bunch before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing was starting plants really
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I've done a lot of research and
developed R&D on this with planting lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds in February, in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: In April and May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for everybody's sake of
understanding the best time, April is your
[SPEAKER_00]: best shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: April and May, you're going to have the
least amount of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get into learning a bunch
of stuff and making some mistakes and
[SPEAKER_00]: having some issues, start your plants in
February and March.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a big lesson,
a lot of lessons you'll learn in that
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of those things is plants will
light stress in that confused state and
[SPEAKER_00]: herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even some genetics that aren't that prone
to herming, when you put them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario where they're not sure where
they're supposed to be, they stunt out,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're stressed and their root growth
isn't happening and they might herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same plant, once it makes itself into
veg, might not herm at all its whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some things that I don't have
any concrete like, oh, this will happen
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure, this will happen for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I know is sometimes plants will herm
if they're stressed early and they won't
[SPEAKER_00]: herm as they finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes I just call anything that I see
herming just because it's not what we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to stimulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want more of that to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm telling you, some of the best
genetics out there will certainly herm if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're confused in an in-between state,
like waking up and then trying to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the daylight's getting longer and
they're confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go into this stunted yellowing and
everybody thinks it's a nutrient deficient
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either temperatures or it's just the
light cycles just not in a zone where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of intricacies within
different genetics that need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: understood from personal experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to bypass all that
learning, you just go straight to April
[SPEAKER_00]: and May, start your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, they'll just go right into veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that I am not the only one who
heard in all of that that you don't do any
[SPEAKER_01]: cloning on the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be remiss if I didn't go back to
that because you're clearly a thoughtful
[SPEAKER_01]: guy and you probably have got some
interesting stuff to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to hear it, Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel strongly against cloning,
but I have a goal as a farmer or breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: to essentially evolve the plant as far
along as it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe maintaining the same plant
for years and years is evolving that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in breeding and making seeds
every year in order to evolve the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's just a better way to go for
advancing the potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cloning is actually hindering the
potential by just getting stuck on one
[SPEAKER_00]: certain thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, a lot of people who are breeding
with clone only stuff might not even know
[SPEAKER_00]: how good of a breeding stock that clone
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying there is oftentimes some
of the best clones that you find are these
[SPEAKER_00]: polyhybrids that are new crosses of this
cross to this times this cross to this
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a wide selection of some pretty cool
genetics to hunt from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this one killer one that has the
traits that you want from all of them and
[SPEAKER_00]: now it's this cut only thing and then
people are seeking that clone to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with because they think it's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth is by breeding to that
clone, you're actually going into some
[SPEAKER_00]: really unstable stock and you're actually
taking your potential and you're diffusing
[SPEAKER_00]: it amongst a bunch of different potential
and it gives you another polyhybrid like
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you have to sort through and where
maybe only one of the hundred plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: you see are the ones you're looking for
versus continually breeding filial
[SPEAKER_00]: generations until the stock is predictable
and then utilizing that as breeding stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of people do a lot
of back crossing in cannabis and they
[SPEAKER_00]: generally are holding on to some mother
and then they're running a generation and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're picking the best and they're
breeding it back to that mother and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing it again and breeding it
back to that mother and so you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: back cross one, back cross two,
back cross three.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that mother is not good breeding
stock which oftentimes it's not because
[SPEAKER_00]: people just don't work their generations
very far, you're actually breeding back to
[SPEAKER_00]: an unstable breeding stock and now you're
just continually taking your line and
[SPEAKER_00]: diminishing its potential is how I see it
versus taking say something that's at like
[SPEAKER_00]: F10 and now using that stock if you're
gonna be holding on to something in clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: form and you hold that to do the back
crossing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I take it a step further, I don't do
any back crossing to mother plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just do back crossing to the same
parental line one generation further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I put out something that I say is a
back cross, what I'm saying is it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: back cross to the one plant that I kept
over winter, I'm saying I'm crossing it
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the parental stock that came from
that stock and I'm only doing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only trying to back cross back to
really things that are predictable so I
[SPEAKER_00]: have some kind of idea of what's gonna
come out in the following generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some things I feel like maybe
have been overlooked in the cannabis world
[SPEAKER_00]: where people just are trying to do these
cool back crosses but the truth is you
[SPEAKER_00]: keep getting these back crosses that are
expressing so much diversity, you're like
[SPEAKER_00]: well I thought that was supposed to be
narrowing that and I think the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake is we're back crossing to
polyhybrids versus back crossing to worked
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a little tangent on that
and as far as clones go, again my main
[SPEAKER_00]: reason for not cloning is just to
strengthen the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow from seed for the commercial market
so it's in my best interest to create seed
[SPEAKER_00]: that is gonna be predictable so that I can
put a row of one variety in and know that
[SPEAKER_00]: all that's gonna come down at a relatively
the same time so I don't have to stagger
[SPEAKER_00]: the harvest like oh this plant's ready but
the plant next to it needs another two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks but the other one, it's like you're
trying to gain predictability in breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: so that when you run things from seed,
you have an idea of what the outcome's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be and you can apply the different
varieties to the different situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that being said, if you're out hunting
for potentially some new thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna wanna buy some polyhybrids
with the genetic stock in the background
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things you like and then you can
hunt that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you really want that to be a stable
breeding stock, now you have to breed and
[SPEAKER_00]: make selections over the next four or five
generations to really hone and isolate the
[SPEAKER_00]: certain characteristics that you're
interested in so that when you do breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with that stock, you know that say this
flower's gonna be purple or that the
[SPEAKER_00]: exaggerated trichome development's gonna
be maintained within this line because the
[SPEAKER_00]: parental stock had been selected for that
for five generations and at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% is showing you exactly what you wanna
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good breeding stock but the old
dosey doe cross OG cross SFV cross gelato
[SPEAKER_00]: mix combination, that's a great phenohunt
but that is not breeding stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, so let's go a little further
down this path man because I never really
[SPEAKER_01]: thought about this quite in this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the commercial cultivators,
they're buying seeds for the season around
[SPEAKER_01]: now, they're popping them, they're making
some choices, they're sexing and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they're making clones en masse so that
they will be ready when it's time to go
[SPEAKER_01]: outside and the first place that I found
that actually just grew everything from
[SPEAKER_01]: seed and then made all their own seeds
every year were the dragonfly folks up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, Kelly and Josh and when,
first time I was sitting down with them in
[SPEAKER_01]: a tent and they were explaining that to
me, I'm like oh my God, that is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean A, it's badass for
self-sufficiency, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that part of it and when you
get to the point as you have described
[SPEAKER_01]: where yeah, you're making your own seeds
but your own seeds are of such an advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: F generation that they don't have as many
irregularities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can plant 10 of them and you can know
what the 10 are gonna be pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: looking like so that they can all be in
the same bag for sale and that they'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to harvest at the same time and so
hearing you describe it, I'm like my mind
[SPEAKER_01]: is blown again thinking about the
additional thought and effort it takes to
[SPEAKER_01]: make all of your own seeds for the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've just given us a really great
August to the spring snapshot of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing for the good of the property
and the microbes and the watershed
[SPEAKER_01]: holistically for the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you give us a little conversation
about you integrating a seed making
[SPEAKER_01]: process because we don't have to talk
about the basics of making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about that here a lot and
most farms are at least making a little
[SPEAKER_01]: seed to experiment and maybe come up with
a house cultivar that they can sell but
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're doing it en masse like you are
and you're relying on it for the next
[SPEAKER_01]: season, how does that integrate on your
calendar?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing on the calendar to make
sure that you have seeds for yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is a great question and there's
a lot to illuminate in this realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot that we're all still
learning in terms of how to do this really
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm beginning to understand it more as I
do it more and more and that makes my seed
[SPEAKER_00]: creation better and better every year
because I'm carrying with me last season's
[SPEAKER_00]: learnings and every season compounds on
every season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the really important things that
people need to understand and I like to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really vulnerable and let people know
where my weaknesses are.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the process of making seeds,
you learn a lot about pollen and there is
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain amount of pollen contamination
that occurs and I'm certainly guilty of
[SPEAKER_00]: having some unexpected pollen hit a place
that I don't really want it to and seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe in the next generation as I
start looking at the plants growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are ways to and these are
the important learnings to maximize your
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to manage a lot of different
pollens in a relatively small area and
[SPEAKER_00]: still come out with mostly 95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know statistics really.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my guess based on what I'm
seeing that it's all going to come out
[SPEAKER_00]: like you want it to and really these
tricks are about how to prevent yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly me that is the pollen
contaminator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one collecting the pollen and I do
that separate from the garden and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: generally inside in my house just up
against the windows and there's up maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: too many plants in one room to be really a
scientific lab type scenario where I can
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantee 100% all this and that but I'm
also like in a position where I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage a bunch of different lines to
advance those lines to become breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: stocks so it's important for me to be
managing males of each variety and many.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that leads to is an understanding of
how to prevent yourself from being a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen contaminator in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go from that room of collecting
pollen, which is happening basically from
[SPEAKER_00]: June until August, I'm managing males and
dealing with pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go directly from my gathering pollen in
the early morning with some coffee and to
[SPEAKER_00]: the field and working and that's where I'm
a hairy guy and I sniff all the buds all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time and usually there's a seed on the
very top of the bud because my nose was
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spraying yourself down with a water
bottle, a spray bottle is a breeder's best
[SPEAKER_00]: friend and then making your seed in
concentrated spots where you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen that you collected is on the branch
of that variety and that likely all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds are gonna be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not know what little seed is on
every plant that's drifted and say there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple seeds in a bud here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't track that but at least you can
track that one branch and so I do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: single branch pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use paper bags to collect the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I freeze the pollen sometimes when it's
early and letting the pollen go before the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower is ready to be pollinated and I'm
making selections all over the field but
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also concentrating certain seed
production within a hoop to prevent more
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen contamination and then the hoop
just has a layer of plastic that gives me
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more ability to not end up ...
You're paying attention to wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never pollinating in wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got at least a barrier between
you and the other plants, it's less
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're spraying down the area that you
just pollinated and you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you can to minimize pollen
drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I know breeders that are on the
coast where it's so humid they don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: have to worry about pollen drift as much
so the climate is gonna dictate that and
[SPEAKER_00]: dry climates and that's ... We're in dry
climate in the fall or summer and fall is
[SPEAKER_00]: where pollen contamination can really be
running rampant and that's where the water
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle and after you collect pollen,
you spray yourself down everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water will prevent the pollen from
one, getting airborne, but two,
[SPEAKER_00]: it also kills the pollen eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't kill it if you've already
pollinated the branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray it and it'll still pollinate
because you've already got it on there but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something to be really mindful of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of stuff I could go
into depth about when you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate to get the best seed production,
not waiting too long but trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all my selections on outdoor plants
so oftentimes I end up breeding towards
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier finishing stuff even within
different lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take a line that may be finished
in mid-October but by the time I'm four
[SPEAKER_00]: generations down, I've done the sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've chosen to pollinate the ones that
have shown resin earlier and now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing two weeks earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of stuff going on in
the breeding realm that's worthy of
[SPEAKER_00]: exploring.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all the different breeders and
sharing the information because really
[SPEAKER_00]: what we want to do is not hold onto this
stuff as some proprietary bullshit that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make us a bunch of money in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that's really going to
create health and wellness for everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future is shared information so
that we can all be doing a better job of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're trying to do and that way we
can all be more successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever worry about do I save this
information that I want to take and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you for some consulting gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you the same stuff on
this podcast that I would if you wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay me for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that entrepreneurial drive to
just find the gem that I can just bank a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of money off of because I really do
believe that real capital is found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: land and in our practices and in the
health of the ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: By sharing and giving the information
freely, it's almost like puts the burden
[SPEAKER_00]: on everybody else to continue to do the
same thing and to stop this process of I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get rich off of what I know and
think that I'm going to capitalize on
[SPEAKER_00]: other people's inability to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot in the breeding realm that
we all need to be paying attention to but
[SPEAKER_00]: really practice is going to be the most
important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that aren't
practicing as much as they maybe should
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a very specific follow-up
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been talking about how the
thriving nature of your plants and the
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance of the flowers is primarily
based in the fact that they are
[SPEAKER_01]: participating in a complex organism that
is your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is incubated with indigenous
microbes, has got an abundance of local,
[SPEAKER_01]: varied nutrients, a lot of it
wild-crafted, a lot of it from your
[SPEAKER_01]: animals so that you've created this matrix
of life support and because of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: your flowers do so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that play into the seed creation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we could go down this path and
just turn this whole last set into a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding set but that's not really the
goal since we want to focus more on the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasonal impacts on your property and how
to work with that regeneratively.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of hints might you have to offer
us about making seeds on a farm that is
[SPEAKER_01]: using regenerative practices?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can give us two or three of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a space that actually is that
life support, super resilient,
[SPEAKER_00]: really diverse, you can take what people
consider to be the worst pot and grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: and get something very good, something way
better than what it was when you saw it
[SPEAKER_00]: last.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something to be said for just the
really healthy rhizosphere and heavy mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: buffers the soil rhizosphere to a degree
that makes things possible that you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't see elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I believe all cannabis is
really good because I see it expressing
[SPEAKER_00]: itself in a really healthy environment and
therefore what somebody might assess and
[SPEAKER_00]: say is just low quality weed might
actually be high quality weed given the
[SPEAKER_00]: right circumstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In making seeds in this environment,
it's like any other environment truly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about selections and so the more
plants you have to select from,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better selection process you can have,
the better the sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be called, breeders use the term
sifting through genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, I think the biggest mistake that
gets made and I've made is I just think I
[SPEAKER_00]: know which one is the best and I just put
everything on that and then to come find
[SPEAKER_00]: out at the end of the season it molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't just only pick the
ones you think are the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say if you're making seed, go ahead and
make seed on a lot of the different plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not the whole plant and this is
where the details are important,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just on a branch because you don't
know how it's going to finish until it
[SPEAKER_00]: finishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think I can make all the best
selections and that's me doing the work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the truth is I need to stop giving
myself so much credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to be looking at the plants and
saying they're all super valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't make predictions before the end
result so I just need to make sure I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some pollen on all of them so that
when, oh man, the one that I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't the best turned out to be the best
because you cannot pollinate the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your predictions,
but they're just predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not set in stone science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't see it finished so you don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just learned you can't just think you
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be really humble in the
process and just stay open to the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have an ego and your ego
oftentimes wants you to believe you have
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of valuable information more so
than other people, but the truth is that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, the more broader spectrum
practices you can have, the more likely
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll realize that you did something that
preserved what it is that you really
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted because we don't always know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hit that another time, Nick,
because you're talking about the ego part
[SPEAKER_01]: of this and I gotta tell you, listening to
some of the... I don't say this
[SPEAKER_01]: negatively, but I'm gonna use the word
loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listening to some of the more loose
breeding practices that you've talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about, you're like, hey man, I'm the one
who accidentally lets pollen go on my
[SPEAKER_01]: shirt or on my nose or whatever or you're
collecting pollen together in your living
[SPEAKER_01]: room and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like for people who are coming to
cannabis from a real control place,
[SPEAKER_01]: a real ego control place, that sounds
like, oh my God, that's such poor
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: God knows what's gonna come out the other
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know what comes out the other end of
your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have enjoyed your flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen lots of different flowers at
different times a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've toured your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown your genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people who flock to your
genetics and they rely on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that what comes out is pleasing
people and doing their job and being used
[SPEAKER_01]: reliably on other people's farms in the
form of seeds, but also it's coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: this environment that you're working in
that I would not call hyper controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like invitations to nature versus
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that that's pretty much how you
live your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't be the only one hearing you
talk who's having this kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: internal being torn both directions where
it's like, oh my God, his work all sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: so holistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna smoke that flower and I wanna grow
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, I've got the part of
me and going like, oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds are not all gonna be exactly
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speak a little bit to just how you resolve
that for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I say, you try out seeds and it's
like, I've tried a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've seen what's coming down the
lines of all these other breeders and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank everybody for making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you start getting further down
the filial generation and I can only say
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes from experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like again, I like to give myself the,
let people know the vulnerabilities in the
[SPEAKER_00]: places where maybe I'm not as controlled
as people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the proof is in the pudding and I'm
cracking seeds and I'm reliably getting
[SPEAKER_00]: what I say is coming from the parental
lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is about getting better at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm way better at it now than I was four
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by staying open and continuing the
process and watching the seeds grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can start to really dictate whether
your practices are functioning the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And giving the power over to nature and to
those natural processes is always gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthen your stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say just like, you can acquire
seeds from a bunch of different people and
[SPEAKER_00]: just grow them out and just ask yourself
what looks similar, what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly, if you cross something that's dank
to something that's dank, you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might not all be the same dank,
but it's dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, that's where I started when
I began the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm like, oh, F1 stock is so good
when you're working with breeding stock on
[SPEAKER_00]: both parental lines that it's worth making
sure that you continue the filial
[SPEAKER_00]: generations on the lines with the traits
that you're looking for so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: make those F1s later for people who are in
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really, the F1 stock is for
commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a commercial producer and you
wanna grow things from seed, you wanna be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for that F1 stock that is real F1
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means both parental lines have been
worked for years and years and are coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out at least predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they mesh together,
they actually come out really uniform with
[SPEAKER_00]: some traits from both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hybrid vigor, the heterozygosity
is way higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting yields, you're getting
terpene results that are way more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is where the best weed is gonna
come out of is these F1 crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're working lines down
generations and generations, you might
[SPEAKER_00]: actually even see the overall return
become less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe the percentages even become
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean it's gonna make
something that's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the piece that's kinda confusing is
as I take some things into the F6
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, they're testing lower than
they ever have, but their offspring are
[SPEAKER_00]: combining so well with the others that it
shoots the numbers up in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a game that we're all playing and
everybody gets so demoralized when their
[SPEAKER_00]: test result maybe comes back lower than
they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, if you understand that those test
results can come back lower and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to grow that one for commercial
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you use that one in making a cross
with another one that is in production,
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred and maybe doing the same thing,
the result doesn't mean a low percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm finding low percentage inbred lines
combined together make the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at a lot of COAs and because I have
to get tests for every lot that goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: the market and all this stuff,
I'm getting a good idea of the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: background genetics in each lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm able to kinda run with that and
then look at like when I take a
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenoline variety and I put it on the
myrcine variety, do I see both terpenoline
[SPEAKER_00]: and myrcine or do I see one just kinda eat
out the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the case is when those lines are
inbred, I'm seeing both of the parental
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles combining into the
offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing the THC levels increase and on
the offspring, 10% higher than either
[SPEAKER_00]: parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things that I'm just
not willing to say we know yet because I
[SPEAKER_00]: just need to continue down the process of
R&D, growing these seeds every year,
[SPEAKER_00]: making my selections, growing those seeds,
looking at the tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's flaws in everybody's breeding
program and it's important for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize the flaws so that we can work on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really where we gain strength
is when we see our weaknesses,
[SPEAKER_00]: we work on those weaknesses, we see our
strengths and we understand our strengths
[SPEAKER_00]: and we move forward with that holistic
kind of approach of knowing we have more
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn and that we're not just all the
best breeders in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna finish with this today,
Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been to your property and a lot of
your examples, you're able to do on your
[SPEAKER_01]: property because you've been doing this
year over year for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've put a lot of labor and love and
calendar into your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of folks who are listening
today, either maybe they've got a new farm
[SPEAKER_01]: or they're converting their farm from
traditional agriculture or traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial era agriculture practices to
becoming more regenerative, or maybe it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a farm that's trying to convert themselves
to get a quality regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: certification like the Dempure
certification or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a lot of people who have got
an ideal that they share with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're at the beginning of the game,
whereas you're many years into this game.
[SPEAKER_01]: What words of reassurance do you have for
folks that they should go along this path
[SPEAKER_01]: even though the labor and the amount of
time that it's gonna take to get there
[SPEAKER_01]: seems so long?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're teaching, you don't really
teach as much growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You teach biological systems and that
takes some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll finish off here by, I'll give you
the mic and I'll say what message do you
[SPEAKER_01]: have for these folks who are at the
beginning of this path?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first and foremost, you have to love
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been obsessed a little bit with
cannabis ever since I started integrating
[SPEAKER_00]: my experiences in nature with being
affected by this cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the people that are trying to
go down this route, if they're into it for
[SPEAKER_00]: the money, I can say you're gonna fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into it because your passion is
there, I say don't get too caught up in
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make a ton of money off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stay focused on the passionate piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, if you're into breeding,
if somebody would have told me,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, like just even six years ago,
just hey, you're gonna wanna pay attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to keeping your lines as pure as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't matter if you get a
polyhybrid to start with, but just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: working those filial generations until you
see something coming out more uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the most important work and
especially from an outdoor, I grow one
[SPEAKER_00]: crop a year, I don't do indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not running multiple seasons through
the year and advancing populations very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna see the F10 generation,
but I've gotta wait four more years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're starting and you really are
passionate and you really wanna be
[SPEAKER_00]: developing something that is something
you've really helped steward and shepherd
[SPEAKER_00]: and can be feeling really good about,
is that you start the process of gathering
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want and keeping those lines in
those lines for a while before you start
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what inevitably happens,
and this is speaking to breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, it's all different based on your
goals and outcomes, but I'm really like
[SPEAKER_00]: weighed towards breeders because I'm
really passionate about it, is that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like don't get too wrapped up in like
making, like crossing everything because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something so dank over here and
there's something so dank over here that
[SPEAKER_00]: you just know that those are the two best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put those two together and the
male pollen, you only have one male that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've selected for all of your crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that's just narrowing your
potential and potentially taking you down
[SPEAKER_00]: a path you don't wanna be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your lines going in their own
directions before you start crossing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can acquire some inbred lines,
that's the way you wanna go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna buy inbred lines, something that
somebody's worked for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it and continue the work in a
different direction within that line
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's always a spectrum of
what's gonna express within a certain line
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't hone every single trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might hone a couple of traits that we
know are gonna pass on, but in the long
[SPEAKER_00]: run, there's all kinds of, there's flower
morphology, there's plant structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's leaf type, there's all these
different traits that might get bypassed
[SPEAKER_00]: and looked to for only the resin and
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's always a little bit of a,
there's always a spectrum to choose from,
[SPEAKER_00]: even from a worked line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to keep those lines continually worked
and then start crossing those lines later
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll have a much better result is my
belief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish somebody had told me that a
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to realize that in my journey
of just studying, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been about studying crops outside of
cannabis and how breeding occurs in those
[SPEAKER_00]: crops and then taking some of those
scientific learnings from the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and applying them to the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, it's just a plant is a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all different, but some of the
breeding practices can certainly result in
[SPEAKER_00]: similar end results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you want to grow for outdoor
production, you do want real F1 stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really wanna be hitting the IBLs
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna ask you the same question,
but with a different emphasis,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you won regenerative gardening awards
and a lot of people look up to you and how
[SPEAKER_01]: you have developed this property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for people who may not be breeders,
but they're on a new property,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have any hugelkultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just building their first berms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to figure out what's in the
forest around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all seems like so much,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is, it can be so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What words of inspiration do you have for
people who may not be breeders?
[SPEAKER_01]: Heck, they might not even be growing
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The kind of show we've had today,
we haven't actually used the word cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: all that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works for cannabis, but it's also gonna
work for food crops as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what kind of final parting shots or
inspiration do you have for folks who are
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to grow in their biological system
and they're feeling like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is gonna take the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like to address this one in
this way that, again, it's probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: what people are expecting me to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth is, is if you're gonna
connect with your landscape, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: take time to connect with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so stop all the research and looking
for the answers online and looking for the
[SPEAKER_00]: answers through people like me and looking
for answers from anything but me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start your land and start the process of
slowing down and taking time to spend in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spaces that you wanna cultivate and
asking the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you go out there and
physically make a loud noise that is
[SPEAKER_00]: asking a question, but you go out there
and you listen and you observe and you pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention, you take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even like, oh land, what can I do
to grow some really awesome things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like, what is this land?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: And meditate on some of the deeper things
so that you could start to pierce the
[SPEAKER_00]: veils that have been put in front of our
realities and start to really hone in on
[SPEAKER_00]: this idea of humans are here and can have
really healthy, positive, impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is gonna really make this place
thrive?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a deeper internal
deprogramming and smoke weed when you do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee if you utilize cannabis in the
natural setting with the right intentions,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really helps guide you into the aha
moments that are much less likely to come
[SPEAKER_00]: across watching a YouTube video on some
regenerative farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, spend your time in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna connect with nature and be a
voice for nature, you have to live there
[SPEAKER_00]: to have that understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're just trying to find the
answer and the answers are not concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are way more philosophical than we
want them to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a measure your input and if
you put this down, it will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like you have to do the work
with the world you wanna live in and it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't always look like the work you
wanna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oftentimes, it starts from your within
and it starts with how you interpret what
[SPEAKER_00]: you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're already down the path,
and you really wanna do good, you really
[SPEAKER_00]: have to start exploring, well,
what do I think is doing good and how is
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe not so good and what are the
cultural problems with this colonial
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer capitalist society that is all
about killing life and creating
[SPEAKER_00]: monocultures?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to understand we've been super,
super affected by that culture and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: still in that culture and our thought
processes are kinda geared towards that
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we start getting into the
periphery zone of making advancements into
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential of our ability to steward
land, it starts to look like we're anti
[SPEAKER_00]: the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some ways, it feels like a path
that is very outside the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very feels like everybody is just on a
journey that's just destroying the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really have to connect with nature
again in order to actually realize how we
[SPEAKER_00]: can help the process of nature and even
understand what a healthy ecology is.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were preparing for this show,
Nick, you said this one thing that struck
[SPEAKER_01]: me and I put it in my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You told me you don't grow good cannabis
by focusing on the cannabis, you grow good
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis by being a good steward of all
the biological systems surrounding the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a recurring theme that
goes throughout this show is that if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're taking care of the entire living
matrix around your garden, that that can
[SPEAKER_01]: only benefit your plants and it's probably
gonna benefit them more than the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the crap you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, and it's gonna benefit everybody
and everything on the planet at this
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any kind of work we can do towards taking
care of our ecology is work that is worth
[SPEAKER_00]: doing at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Nick, thank you so much for taking
the time to be with us, especially at this
[SPEAKER_01]: early morning time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on farmers hours today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so thank you for taking time away from
the garden and your family for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for sharing your vast
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of our thanks for sharing your
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people who talk about
these same topics in a pretty dry
[SPEAKER_01]: functional way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your passion and compassion for nature
really comes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to give a special shout
out to my wonderful family and my little
[SPEAKER_00]: boy and my wife for all the support
because truly this isn't this wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is without them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my whole world has shifted in this
last year with this new little one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my desire to continue the process of
caring for the ecology is strengthened
[SPEAKER_00]: even more by having a little one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, just big love to the whole
family, my brother, my parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: my wife, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
