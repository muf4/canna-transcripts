[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited about the guest
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest tonight is Tad Hussey of Keep It
Simple Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep It Simple is an edible nursery,
production greenhouse, outdoor preschool,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic hydroponic shop, and feed store in
Redmond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad is an educator and sought-after
speaker on probiotic growing for all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of crops, cannabis, food, and anything
else that there might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tonight he's going to talk about a wide
range of probiotic growing techniques so
[SPEAKER_00]: your gardens thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw this presentation at CannaCon in
Seattle over the winter, and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: standing room only.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple other people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's all packed in because Tad's
experience is so valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you find it valuable as well
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give Tad a warm welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, I just want to say thank you to
Shaco and Vivian for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talked to Shaco and he told me I
had a little more time to talk,
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually changed my talk around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made it more about kind of my journey
through growing and learning, and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: cover all the topics that we discussed,
but just in a slightly different order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of just talked biological
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll explain more here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see if we can get this thing
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is Keep It Simple Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my place out in Redmond.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents own a seven-acre property here,
and about five years ago now we realized
[SPEAKER_01]: that the nursery industry was crumbling,
and I was just getting into edible
[SPEAKER_01]: landscaping, chickens, and all of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an online business, and the nursery
that was on the property moved to a new
[SPEAKER_01]: location, what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to take it in a totally
different direction, focused on urban
[SPEAKER_01]: farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We opened a feed store.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing, like Shaco said, we have an
outdoor preschool that meets there every
[SPEAKER_01]: day, and that was the giant pumpkin we
grew one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 725 pounds, in for over 1,000 this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is just kind of a shot of
the property here to give you a little
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have a trail in the back along
Bear Creek, which is the salmon spawning
[SPEAKER_01]: stream, just for education, where we have
over 1,000 people every fall coming
[SPEAKER_01]: through to learn about salmon and about
native habitats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really excited to just be part of
the community there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a wonderful piece of property if you
ever get a chance to come out to Revin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love to give you guys a tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our greenhouse in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing veggie stores all from seed at
the beginning of the year, starting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we eventually, that's actually my
dad right there, we plant it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a photo towards the end of the
season, where we had a beneficial bug mix
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in this little row here,
our tomatoes over here, and then right
[SPEAKER_01]: here we have our cucumbers that are just
kind of on their last legs for the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything's just kind of started up
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't gotten tomatoes yet,
but we're getting really close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some farm shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we had a farmer come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had baby pigs recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are mini pigs, so the full-grown is
still not all that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got turkeys running around.
[SPEAKER_01]: These goats arrived two weeks ago,
including this little baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're mini nubians, so we will hopefully
eventually have milky goats.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing I love about the property is
the kids actually get to come in and
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with the animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an area with the chickens and the
turkeys and some of the beehives where the
[SPEAKER_01]: kids get to go right in there and interact
with them with their parents, because that
[SPEAKER_01]: was something I never really got to do as
a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, oh, I don't know, about 10 years ago,
I was working.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad had this online business selling
compost keepers, and I came into the
[SPEAKER_01]: business after finishing my master's
degree down in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept getting all these phone calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were like, hey, I'm growing 30
tomatoes in my basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what is everyone using our
product for?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started doing a little research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I walked into my first hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of what you see when you
walk in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like walking down that aisle at Home
Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what does this have to do
with growing plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was totally foreign to me, because I've
come from having my parents money in the
[SPEAKER_01]: landscaping business and nursery my entire
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't even seen any bottle of nutrients
before then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started looking into it at that point
and trying to learn more about what
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly was going on in the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I like to talk about
is the environmental impact of some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these bottle of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did a consult at one of the larger
502s this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I walked into their facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were literally emptying one of
these totes of chemical nutrients down the
[SPEAKER_01]: drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked them, where is that going?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, oh, we have a septic out back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're literally across the street from
the fisheries and wildlife.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just waiting for the EPA to show up on
the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the next big issue
we're going to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a lot of these larger grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important that you consider
where this stuff is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, the traditional thing
is you get your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fairly inert.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pour your bottle of nutrients on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You directly feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to, oh, let me back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these phosphates that we're
dumping are creating algal blooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: which pull all the dissolved oxygen out of
the water as the algae grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have all these areas where
fish and other wildlife are no longer able
[SPEAKER_01]: to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the largest, besides Texas,
is actually in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So homeowners in general, especially with
our perfect-looking lawns and then also
[SPEAKER_01]: our cannabis plants, we need to be
especially careful not to be putting
[SPEAKER_01]: excess nutrients out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I was getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to that, when we're done
growing, a lot of growers, they dispose of
[SPEAKER_01]: their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is now no good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to throw it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it ends up looking like this in your
landscape because it has all the perlite
[SPEAKER_01]: in it the first time it rains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the traditional way that
people were growing for the last,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, 20 or 30 years, ever since
20 days nutrients were invented.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during this process, I started reading
more and learning more about what is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually going into these products and
what are we paying for.
[SPEAKER_01]: One example is potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So silica helps with thicker stalks,
keeps the plants from tipping over in the
[SPEAKER_01]: wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also helps with overall plant health
and growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if there's too much of any
micronutrient in the soil, like a little
[SPEAKER_01]: too much manganese or a little too much
iron, the silica will help mitigate that
[SPEAKER_01]: by spreading it more evenly through the
leaf tissue so you have less damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So silica is a wonderful addition to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different ways you can
get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were to go down to the store,
the hydroshop, and buy it, the most common
[SPEAKER_01]: brand I think most people know is Dynagro
Pro-Tac.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one I heard of before I got
into growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: $44 a gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all they're doing is taking this
powder here this eggsil 16H, which we sell
[SPEAKER_01]: online for $12 a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes up 3 quarters of a gallon to
the exact same strength as Dynagro
[SPEAKER_01]: Pro-Tac.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silica Blast has a little bit of sodium
silicate, but we don't really need more
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium for the most part because a lot are
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Rhinoskin, which is an advanced
nutrients one, is really the worst in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't pick on these other
polynutrient companies with the exception
[SPEAKER_01]: of advanced nutrients because I think
they've done a lot to hurt the industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of the way they've promoted
themselves and cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just well known, I think,
for really people off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we start looking at what's in
organic polynutrients, because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: completely organic on our property.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't sell chemical nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know a lot about chemical
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand how they function,
but it's not something I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to stick to organic
polynutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's in most of these products that
we see here, you're going to find
[SPEAKER_01]: molasses, chemic acids, seaweed,
fish emulsion, fish hydrolysate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these other products that we see
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's in most of these products that
we see here, you're going to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: putting on more nitrogen than you realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant's going to grow a little
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you think that you have to spend
an extra $100 on this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a crazy racket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something I was never really
aware of until I had to register my first
[SPEAKER_01]: product as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also, when I'm looking at soil tests,
I can't necessarily assume that that NPK
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think I'm putting out to match my
soil test is actually going to match it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep those things in mind just in the
back of your head when you're evaluating
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So molasses, that's what you're going to
find in products called Straft,
[SPEAKER_01]: or Sweet, or Bud Candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, enhanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sell a three and a half gallon bucket
for around $20 at our store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unsulfured blackstrap molasses is really
unsulfured blackstrap molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to spend all this money on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one other thing about it too,
it's not going to make your buds taste any
[SPEAKER_01]: sweeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants don't work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole pork roulette on your plants
would get a bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sugars in there, though,
are a wonderful microbial food for all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different microorganisms that we'll talk
about in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has a little bit of potassium in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you don't need to spend your
money on a brand like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seaweed is one of my favorite amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It contains over 70 different elements,
plant growth hormones and plant growth
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with drought resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heat and cold stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the best things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had to choose just a couple things
that I could use in my garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp meal or seaweed would be probably top
of the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we look at what's actually in
them, they're all going to be seaweed
[SPEAKER_01]: derived from Asco phylogedosum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's North Atlantic sea kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most widely studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to read more about kelp,
there's a little book you can get for
[SPEAKER_01]: probably $20 on Amazon by T.L.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sen called Seaweed and Plant Growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use it two ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use kelp meal, which I mix into the soil
per my potting mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also carry a product that I
buy from Acadian makes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the same with this nature's
essence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just think of it like an extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a fine concentrated orange
juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can add this to water and get over
100% balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're harvesting seaweed,
which I think that might've been what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting at, you do need to rinse
and wash it to remove all the salt and
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium from it prior to composting it or
putting it in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can pick up a lot of these same
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little different kelp that we have
out here, but it can still be beneficial.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see, a pound, I think it's
off around $18 or you can, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of places you can find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make up over 100 gallons liquid kelp to
the same rates as what they're selling you
[SPEAKER_01]: in these bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's just another way to save
your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humic acids are excellent chelators,
which means they bond with the minerals in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil and help make the plants
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Variety of different products,
again, when it comes to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that we use are, it's called the
Ferntaria.
[SPEAKER_01]: The SPB5, it's 85% humic acid by content.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're using just an eighth of a teaspoon
per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes out of the agricultural
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gentleman that I buy the seaweed and
the humic acid from is over in Lancaster,
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he works with all the, all the
farmers, large scale farmers over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because realistically, like no farmer is
buying roots organics or general,
[SPEAKER_01]: general hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, I, I fairly believe cannabis is a
special plant and it's meant to be
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, but it is called weed for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hard to grow once you learn
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from a nutrient perspective,
it's actually quite easy to grow a big,
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy, robust plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish hydrolysate, that's probably the one
liquid nutrient that I really like to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use it on our veggie starts when they
start to get a little bit root down in
[SPEAKER_01]: our, in our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish hydrolysate is very different than
fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fish emulsion is going to be very high
in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish hydrolysate is going to be much
higher in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish, fish emulsion is typically the
Alaska fish fertilizer that you may see in
[SPEAKER_01]: the stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep in mind that they're very
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you give both of them to
soil-based microbes, the fish hydrolysate
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to perform exponentially better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a much better microbial food than
fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is the natural form of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: A natural form?
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on the brand, like Organic
Gem, I believe they use an enzymatic
[SPEAKER_01]: process to break down the fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all certified organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do have to put in a small amount
of phosphoric acid as a stabilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as I know, every organic
certified agency allows for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it would break down way too
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is such a good microbial food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use it to charge our biochar that we
put into our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We soak it for a week in the fish
hydrolysate as a way to fill the cation
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the other things I like to point
out right now, this has been a big issue
[SPEAKER_01]: with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that a lot of consumers and
medical patients weren't even aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think when they're buying plants,
it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grown naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it really isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, there are a lot of
unscrupulous people growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a lot easier to spray your
plant with Eagle 20 and not have to worry
[SPEAKER_01]: about powdery ability for the life of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these things are systemic for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: They live inside the leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that you want to be
putting in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can know your grower,
I think that's really the best thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or grow your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really what we promote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other thing I'd like to point out,
this just came out recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Oregon Department of Agriculture
tests a lot of these microbial plot
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something like the MFT, for example,
they would test to see are they meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: the claims that they say they're putting
on these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because no one else is doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put whatever you want on the
label, and no one's regulating it when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to microbial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of their findings were kind of
surprising, like this advanced nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: product, Piranha.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't protect any of the product that
they claimed was in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Irv came back higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these tests are all freely available
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you shoot me an email, I can send you a
link to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG BioWars, another one most people know
in microbial applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Santee of Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are looking at these things to
actually test to see if you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because it's on a label,
just because it's made as a claim,
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean it's necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really have to do your due
diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after all that, I decided, I figured
there's got to be a better way to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this first half of my talk is really
focused on what I learned from my father.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from Dr. Lee Bingham and Jeff
Lowenfels when it comes to organic
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is my philosophy for the first 10
years that I was growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is biological horticulture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is a photo from the Olympic
rainforest.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, Oceane, came to visit from
Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she had never seen trees like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was just a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a big fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she absolutely loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the reasons I like to show this
is because Jeff is always famous for
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, well, there's no one out there
dumping Miracle Grill out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: rainforest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so true.
[SPEAKER_01]: These ecosystems are diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're phenomenally healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all because of the biological
activity that's going on beneath the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and on the surface of the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at this tree, you can see
all these roots down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the plant is photosynthesizing
light, taking in light from the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's putting anywhere from 30% to 70%
of that energy back out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's going out through its roots
to feed the microorganisms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think about it, it just shows
you how important these microbes are to
[SPEAKER_01]: this entire gardening process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we put out Miracle Grill,
which is a highly concentrated salt,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're actually killing off a lot of these
microorganisms through the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we become in charge as the
gardener of directly feeding this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and playing God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in an organic system, really all
we're doing is trying to create the
[SPEAKER_01]: optimal environment for these microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then putting the plant in charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really the most important thing
I can emphasize when it comes to microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: and the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main thing here is the nutrient
cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts off, you have your plants
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to drop leaves down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's photosynthesizing energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also dropping detritus onto the
floor, creating a mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting eaten by different
microorganisms that are then cycling the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients back into nitrogen or whatever
nutrient form the plant was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that energy feeds the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in indoor garden, we're pulling
organic matter and we're pulling nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're not always replacing with
that plant because we're harvesting our
[SPEAKER_01]: crops in our vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can incorporate this concept into
our growing practices for the healthiest
[SPEAKER_01]: plants possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is another thing I stole from Jeff
because I thought it was just such a great
[SPEAKER_01]: illustration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant is really in control of this
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's putting out exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things like sugars, carbons,
carbohydrates right into the soil to
[SPEAKER_01]: select for the type of microorganisms to
create the food that it wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it wants more, I'll say it wanted
more Japanese food one night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it would put out food and the
Japanese first would appear and they could
[SPEAKER_01]: eat that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the next night maybe they want Indian
food or Mexican food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever particular type of exudate it
creates, it can control this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can actually change it on an hourly
basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it wants its nitrogen in the form of
nitrate, it will select for the
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms that will create that
nutrient, that nitrogen in that form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same for ammonium or whatever particular
nutrient that plant wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a soil scientist speak and he was
saying we know more about the moon or
[SPEAKER_01]: about the solar system than we do about
what's going on directly in our feet in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of soil science.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so much more for us to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go over really quickly
just kind of what makes up the biology in
[SPEAKER_01]: our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria and archaea are clumped together
because they have similar functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But archaea is something we didn't even
know existed outside of deep water vents
[SPEAKER_01]: up until, I think, 15, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're their own kingdom classification
all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they function for all intents and
purposes very similar to bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungi, acryl hyphae, protozoa,
those are all the things we studied in
[SPEAKER_01]: eighth grade biology class.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nematodes, microarthropods, worms,
and larger creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: One interesting fact is that they can
produce in the vicinity of five billion
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring in a span of 12 hours if they
have enough food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unchecked, they would double the mass of
the planet in just a couple months.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're amazing, amazing growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show you a photo of some of them
here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is under no electron microscope here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great decomposers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are the ones that break down all
of those green grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that's high in nitrogen,
it's easy to break down simple sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria is going to take it up really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they decompose all that plant matter
and material to cycle these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also immobilize the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that bacteria eats that leaf,
it takes that nitrogen and holds it inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of it until it gets eaten by protozoa,
or ciliate, or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what it then excretes is that it
plants available nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very important part of that
whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it enhances soil quality, because it's
food for these other microorganisms in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, decomposes organic matter for us,
and retains nutrients in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a fancy word for an area
around the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enhances soil structure, competes with
disease-causing organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have beneficial microorganisms
around your roots or on your leaf surface,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to help protect the plant
from air pollution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Airborne and soil-based pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certain bacteria actually can fix
atmospheric nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the rhizome of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty amazing, all the things
that bacteria can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungi, they're the decomposer of all the
browns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're told to get your greens and
browns when you're thermally composting,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's so that the bacteria and fungus can
grow to really decompose everything
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they heat up by their reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they create pathways in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these little pockets, when that hyphae
dies, then bacteria and other things can
[SPEAKER_01]: move through it to different areas of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see how it can create soil
structure just based on how it combines
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and the aggregates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just by having better structure in your
soil, you can reduce erosion and other
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungi release acid, which will lower the
soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: It retains nutrients in its biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's actually a whole field now
created by Paul Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called mycological radiation,
where they've used different species of
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi to deal with everything from
radiation to oil spills.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a really exciting field that's still
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people have seen something like
this before on wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's thousands of strands of fungal hyphae
wrapped around each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it under various types of
different microscopes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Brightfield microscope here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a phase contrast microscope,
which is what I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a microscope filter that my
friend Tim Wilson came up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how people have heard of mycorrhizal
fungi?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's something that we didn't
even know about, I think, also 20 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's fairly popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of plants have a symbiotic
relationship with this fungus,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the exception of brassicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like kale, broccoli,
cauliflower can actually have decreased
[SPEAKER_01]: health and growth if they do form that
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most plants do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's specific to the type of plant
that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for cannabis, for tomatoes,
for peppers, for fruit trees, it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: endomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you see here is ectomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the endomycorrhizae actually infects
inside the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is one of the primary ways that the
plant gets phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we start looking at different
brands, if we want to spend money to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal products, here's an example of
some.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, what we're looking for is
endomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically, glomus intraravices and
glomus mossii are the two ones most widely
[SPEAKER_01]: studied and known to infect cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fruit trees, vegetables, all the
things we were talking about before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now azaleas, blueberries, those are all a
totally different type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are conifers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really just talking about most of
our basic vegetable crops in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we're getting 83 profugals per gram
of glomus intraravices and glomus mossii,
[SPEAKER_01]: 8 ounces for $71.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're also picking up 313,000 profugals
of trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you were a mushroom grower,
you're probably familiar with trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very aggressive mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very, very aggressive
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very, very aggressive
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very, very aggressive
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very, very aggressive
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's over in Rhode Island, and he's a
giant pumpkin world record holder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his product is guaranteed at 300
spores per gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has testing on his website for five
to 600 spores per gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it runs $12 a pound, five pound
increments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the two products I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, most of these companies, I think,
are sourcing it off in the same place and
[SPEAKER_01]: just cutting it at different levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very few people that are actually
actively cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no mycorrhizae, most of it's coming
out in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we're still taking their word
to a certain level that actually what they
[SPEAKER_01]: say is in here is in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did hear back from the Oregon Department
of Ag that the numbers on the mycos
[SPEAKER_01]: product were pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they haven't released that yet to the
public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all they told me was that they
came back looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you can spend $14 for two spores
per gram thinking you're buying a
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizae product that really isn't
going to do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you buy a fertilizer bag that says
it contains mycorrhizae, you're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: not getting mycorrhizae because they put
just enough to get on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be like 0.01 or 0.05 spores per
gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing I want to mention about it
is it needs to come into direct contact
[SPEAKER_01]: with the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's more than, I think it was like
five millimeters from a root tip,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll never, in fact, grow the best plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just stay in the spore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it actually requires those root
exudates in order to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really important that you put it down
into the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sprinkling it on top of your soil and
watering in is just not an effective way
[SPEAKER_01]: to get that infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, if I'm planning to get better
strawberries or I'm transplanting a rooted
[SPEAKER_01]: clone, I'm putting it directly into the
root zone, right into my transplant hole,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I'm sprinkling it right on the roots
between the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm forgetting that I'm not going
to worry about it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other thing about mycorrhizae I'd
like to mention is in addition to
[SPEAKER_01]: trichoderma, high phosphorus has been
found to inhibit this relationship,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is getting all the phosphorus it
needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to try and cultivate this
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff Lonefels is writing an entire book
that's going to be out this winter just on
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungus, which should be
really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot about this particular
relationship that we're still learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this photo here is of a Nemetophagus
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it because it's a wonderful
illustration of all the things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know that's going on in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a root-eating nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nematodes are blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crawling through looking for a root.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it stumbles into these rings right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these rings are when they fill.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an actual fungus that when the
nematode goes through it, it actually can
[SPEAKER_01]: close.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one of a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it fills with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it will consume that nematode and
then use that nutrients to feed itself and
[SPEAKER_01]: in turn feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's these natural systems that we
weren't even aware of that were going on
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil this whole time that are
really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the sort of things that we
want to promote.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why these microorganisms are so,
so important to the biological aspect of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So protozoa, one thing I just want to say
about them is they consume a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would keep bacteria in check for us,
them and nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they retain the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they die after eating all
this bacteria, what they poop out is also
[SPEAKER_01]: soil-available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually a good nematode there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are little wands that eat bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a root-feeding nematode here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this nematode under a microscope
so you can see the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a root-feeding one actually
inside of the root there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nematodes are good and bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy them actually online for a
variety of different diseases as a
[SPEAKER_01]: biological control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally haven't used them,
but you will, if you look at a slide of
[SPEAKER_01]: good soil or compost, you will naturally
see a bunch of nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, nematodes don't like a liquid
medium so you won't find them in compost
[SPEAKER_01]: tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't grow in compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like being in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nematodes are kind of like the,
I guess the lions and tigers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the apex predator of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They mineralize these nutrients in
fundamental forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they need to find a food source for
other microorganisms as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So worms are actually not native to North
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were brought over by the Europeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe maybe the Vikings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they weren't the Germans.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, the Germans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't here originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're amazing shredders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So organic matter would normally take one,
two years to decompose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without worms, it can be decomposed in
three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they shred everything down really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they increase their microbial activity
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they excrete is not only going to
be higher in beneficial microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they haven't figured it out yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by processing through the worm's body,
it comes out with five times the levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, seven times the levels of
phosphates, and 11 times the levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So worms are amazing creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm not saying go out and buy worms
for your garden or take worms and throw
[SPEAKER_01]: them in your container plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the conditions are right, the worms
will appear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're just wasting your money
and you're feeding your neighbor's garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're killing off a bunch of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do want to buy worms for a worm
bin, you can buy the cocoons online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're much, much more affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any program, I'm a student,
that would permit me to get a loan to have
[SPEAKER_02]: some compost pile and that other people
could use that compost pile and that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can use natural soil and have no need of
any chemicals at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea about that.
Well, I know I'm getting in contact with
someone who can.
OK.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there are programs for composting
through different cities, I know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and counties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not sure about for worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not specifically for worms at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, just for composting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just to have natural soil and no
need of bringing in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not taking any of these out at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there probably are things like that
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not familiar with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only reason I share this slide is
just so people realize that it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: linear progression.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these things are interacting together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bird, for example, is going to have
mites and other microorganisms on its feet
[SPEAKER_01]: every time it lands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to fly somewhere else and drop
down these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to the bathroom, which is eaten
by bacteria, nematodes, all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they work together symbiotically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a web, not a linear relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a chart I like to show people
because it really started over on this
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the plants that prefer highly
bacterial soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soils progress, they become more
fungally dominant all the way down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: end like here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Candace, veggies, things they end up right
around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to balance the bacteria and
fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, when we make compost
teas, when we're looking at microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: products, we're just trying to put out,
it's a shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting out what we can to let the
plant really be in control.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people get caught up on this
chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to say, well, I'm growing
tomatoes and tomatoes like bacterial soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm only going to do things that have
bacteria, which gets us away from that
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing that I was showing you earlier
where the plant really controls that
[SPEAKER_01]: environment in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, one of the interesting things
about plants is they can adjust the pH in
[SPEAKER_01]: the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if the pH of the soil or the water
you're using or the nutrients is not ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant, they can actually change
the pH right in the soil itself for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it means.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found with our soils, over time,
the pH just settles into that 6.6 to 6.8
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if we started with a soil that was 7
and 7.2, higher than you would
[SPEAKER_01]: traditionally think to use for a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how they move?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's through the x-rays, again,
that they're putting out into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They release certain organic acids that
will adjust the soil pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they release the same organic acids in
soil as mediums?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so, but I don't think that if
you don't have enough microbial activity
[SPEAKER_01]: going on around there, then you won't have
that same effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends, I think, on the medium,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa can support a fair amount of
microbial life, but it's in there from the
[SPEAKER_01]: first guillotine if you're mixing or
casting for some other biological source
[SPEAKER_01]: into there, then I think you'd have a much
better chance, whereas peat moss already
[SPEAKER_01]: has a lot of good microbial activity in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we find a rock wall or a truly
hydroponic situation, then I would really
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having good microorganism activity
increases your disease protection,
[SPEAKER_01]: your nutrient immobilization against
bacteria within the cellular walls of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the right nutrients at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helps decompose toxins,
get rid of residues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thatch on the lawn is a classic example of
not having enough microbial activity in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It builds your soil structure,
reduces your water use, increases the
[SPEAKER_01]: water volume capacity, and so on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we increase beneficial biology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a bunch of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost being one of the ones most people
are most familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mulching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost teas, nutrient teas that are going
to feed microorganisms in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and organic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to spend a lot of time on
these, because I think you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: probably pretty familiar with them,
but I can always come back and give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few different types of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thermal, static, and worm composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're buying compost, I tend to
recommend the worm castings, just because
[SPEAKER_01]: most likely the worms did a better job of
it than we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thermal composting, you actually have to
heat the material up to 131 degrees for
[SPEAKER_01]: three days, where you turn it,
keep it below 160.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Static composting, you literally just
leave it in the aisle and let it sit there
[SPEAKER_01]: for a year or two, or six months,
or whatever, until it breaks down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all compost is creating people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I walk through the grocery
store, for example, and I walk by these
[SPEAKER_01]: bags of compost, I just have to shake my
head, because they're not anything I would
[SPEAKER_01]: ever let anywhere near my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the municipal compost are really,
in my opinion, poorly made.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at them under a microscope,
you can see that they're typically not
[SPEAKER_01]: finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you get all the ammonia and
some of the off-casting and the odors.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what the life is right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it depends on the actual product,
and it depends on the facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, in a high-need compost
facility, if they're really doing their
[SPEAKER_05]: job and they're screening well,
you can end up with very little residue.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I used to work in commercial
composting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can believe the stuff that gets
through to those bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would never put it in my garden,
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different types of teas
that you can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to differentiate the difference so
people can understand what we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be an example of something like
this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give some examples here, like
nettles, comfrey, where you take it,
[SPEAKER_01]: steep it in liquid, and then water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not using compost as a source.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main benefit is for nutrients,
not for beneficial microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I hear people talk about
when they say teas, they're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about leaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff that comes out the bottom of
their compost pile or out the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: their worm-in, that's not really a compost
tea, either.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be high in nutrients,
but it's not going to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get some bacteria that's sliding
through there, but that's something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you would want to be careful with and make
sure to look down quietly before watering
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing I like to mention on that
is if you're worm-in, you're getting a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of liquid out of the bottom of your
worm-in, you're putting in either way too
[SPEAKER_01]: much veggies or you're over-watering it,
because really, you shouldn't be needing
[SPEAKER_01]: anything on the bottom of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manure teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something maybe your grandparents
did, where they throw a bunch of manure in
[SPEAKER_01]: a bucket, it stinks up the place in the
barrel, and then you water your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need nitrogen and other
nutrients, but you are also potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: getting some pathogens there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I think would work
great for roses that I wouldn't use in my
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable garden, because I don't want to
risk E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, salmonella, all these things that
are known, and a rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the sweet teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are those things that you're buying
in the store, the Hydra Shop, where they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a label and you put it in a bucket,
and then they tell you you can water it
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked at a lot of these under a
microscope, and there's just not a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: going on a lot of times, which makes sense
when you think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making these organisms go dormant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're left on a shelf for who knows how
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to avoid these products whenever
possible, unless I don't have any other
[SPEAKER_01]: alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost extract is where the farmer has a
ton of compost and doesn't have time to
[SPEAKER_01]: brew at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just needs a lot of liquid,
so they're just stripping the
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms off of the soil aggregates
out into a liquid media and then applying
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, the one that I'm most familiar
with is aerated compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also called ACT, or A-C-T.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really what our company
specialized in for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole idea behind it is really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want aerobically brewed, so we're
selecting for aerobic microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are ones that want high levels of
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you walk down to the edge of a pond
or a swamp and it's all that stinky smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's from anaerobes, things that like
low to no oxygen levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you pick up really healthy soil
that has very little odor to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: if any, that's all those beneficial
microorganisms that are real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next to that, the water source is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having clean water without chlorine or
chloramines in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, compost is one of the last
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having compost that has good biology in it
because your brewer is only going to
[SPEAKER_01]: replicate the microorganisms that you put
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what food source you add to that is
going to determine what microorganisms
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be as simple as literally throwing
some compost in a bucket, stirring it for
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 hours as you walk by periodically,
and watering it down with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can get really scientific with it
in my brewer where you know you're
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining your dissolved oxygen levels
above six milligrams per liter for the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire brew cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what our company is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tested all of this, and we came up with
recipes, and I can tell you with this
[SPEAKER_01]: elevation and this temperature,
you should brew for this length,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll get this final product.
But don't get daunted by that,
to feel like you have to go out and buy a
brewer.
You can make these things at home.
I can send you links.
There's plenty of ways to do it affordably
on your own too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_05]: The same thing of the compost is putting
worm cap things in, and you can do the
[SPEAKER_05]: same thing with the worm cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this the same thing where you put a
little pond pump in the bucket?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a feature also in your experience
for iteration?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is a pump that has an impeller motor
where the compost, the microorganisms are
[SPEAKER_01]: going through the motor itself,
a lot of times that will kill off a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you were to have an air pump where
you're pushing oxygen into a tank,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you use an airlift, then it's much
better for the organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, when this industry first
started 15, 20 years ago, they were using
[SPEAKER_01]: little aquarium pumps and a little tiny
air stone, and then we found that those
[SPEAKER_01]: really weren't maintaining enough oxygen
to the levels that we wanted, so we had
[SPEAKER_01]: now bigger pumps, and then we found the
air stones really hard to clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to use merionic acid and make it
clogged with biofilm, because the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: forms glues to try and stick around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't get it clean, it will build
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff always used the example of our
biofilm being the plaque on your teeth in
[SPEAKER_01]: the morning when you wake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That slimy surface, that's all created by
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually have to remove that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to do that on an air
stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my little lab at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little home office now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my microscope setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the tea looks like under a
microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can really see,
but there's a lot of bacteria cruising
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably a piece of alfalfa or a
small bit of organic food, but this is
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're looking for under the
microscope, because otherwise you just
[SPEAKER_01]: have a bucket of brown water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have no idea what the heck is
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: While the microscope is fun, it's not
necessarily a tool that everyone needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: use, but it is a great one to have around.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably at 200 times
magnification.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably getting a little bit more
from the camera itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing in the biology aspect of
this is biological controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that's becoming really
popular in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I had an issue with thrips,
and I was just going in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to spray anything,
because I was always scared it would get
[SPEAKER_01]: some pistol formation up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought some of the cucumeris,
which is an insect right here that will
[SPEAKER_01]: eat the juvenile thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roe beetles was another one that will
consume thrips, as well as fungus and that
[SPEAKER_01]: larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are alternatives and ways to control
different disease problems in your garden
[SPEAKER_01]: without having to spray or anything
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different companies
that sell these online.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I saw a fire for shame back there
with natural events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used evergreen growers in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of different places
you can get these bugs now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't buy these in a store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would order them online and have them
shipped to you, just so that you know when
[SPEAKER_01]: it is going to be fresh and more viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first 10 years of my
gardening experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an extent of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, okay, if I have a problem,
I put on more compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It solves everything, and I get healthy
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really get into the whole idea of
these different minerals and their point
[SPEAKER_01]: in the nutrients in the soil until I read
Steve Solomon's book, The Intelligent
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anyone in here read this book?
[SPEAKER_01]: A few people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always promote it in my talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk to Steve all the time online now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, what he did in his introduction
in his book, I think, is really what made
[SPEAKER_01]: it, sold me on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's found a territorial seed down in
Oregon back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was homesteading, I think 80% off of
just his land, trialing all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different seed crops, really committing to
this homestead lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, as he was doing this,
he was just bringing in more compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started to get loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: His teeth started, his gums started to get
loose, and his wife's fingernails were
[SPEAKER_01]: softening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They moved to Fiji.
[SPEAKER_01]: While they were living in Fiji,
their health improved dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to look at the exact same diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't growing themselves,
but he looked at where their vegetables
[SPEAKER_01]: were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found that they had a field,
or valley, where all these vegetables were
[SPEAKER_01]: being grown that was flooded every year by
igneous rock deposits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, the field was being
remineralized with all these rock dusts
[SPEAKER_01]: every year by this river.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he moved back to Oregon, and
continued with the same diet, and started
[SPEAKER_01]: having the exact same health problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started looking into this idea of
mineralization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually dates all the way back to,
I think, the 1910s and the 1920s with
[SPEAKER_01]: William Albrecht.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, there's been people like
Michael Sterak, Kerry Reeves, with the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole idea that if you balance the
minerals and the soil, everything else,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the beneficial microorganisms and
everything else, will take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, the first half of my talk there,
when you hear from Dr. Lane Ingham and
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff Lowenthal, it's like, if you get all
the beneficial microorganisms there,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll make everything available on the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Steve had to say made a lot of sense
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you plant its own soil that
doesn't have the right levels of zinc and
[SPEAKER_01]: manganese and all these other things,
then they're not going to be in that
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato, and then what I'm eating is not
going to be as healthy as it could have
[SPEAKER_01]: been, and neither is the crop itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where he started getting the idea
of soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of his book is pretty dry,
but it's on the whole concept of balancing
[SPEAKER_01]: the minerals to grow nutrient-dense
vegetables, so the healthiest vegetables
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: He claims that since doing this,
he actually stopped eating so many
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables because they were so much
healthier for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also looked at different cultures
around the world and what sort of mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: and nutrient deficiencies those
populations had based on the soils that
[SPEAKER_01]: they were growing agriculturally on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a test from a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually on our soils that we
make.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little bit, I believe,
three years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been amending every cycle for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the test that resulted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, these test results, one test here,
is just $25.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a garden you want to test your
soil, it's $25.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to spend that on
fertilizer anyway and not even know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting the right fertilizer for
your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great, great option for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lab that we really like to use is
Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that your question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Logan Labs standard soil test,
it's $25.
[SPEAKER_01]: It explains on their website how to take a
sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: King County will give you a free soil test
within the labs, but they don't look at
[SPEAKER_01]: anything beyond your macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That free test doesn't tell us levels of
boron or iron or zinc or any of these
[SPEAKER_01]: other micronutrients or trace minerals
that we may want.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but our plants love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was our first year growing in this
fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually from this year at the
beginning of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was from a couple of years ago inside
of our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of our own buildings and
building.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have exceptionally healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I call it biology and
horticulture is because I like the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: doing both that biological aspect,
but also incorporating the science and
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture of mineral balancing in some
of these other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I told Shango I would talk about,
this whole idea of why you're growing your
[SPEAKER_01]: own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: From this angle you can't really see,
but all along here we have our fence line
[SPEAKER_01]: around our employee garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We planted comfrey all the way along that
edge because comfrey is a dynamic
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pulls up nutrients out of the soil into
its biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces a ton of biomass, which you
get to harvest three or four times a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it to feed your worms,
to feed your animals, to compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: or just a lot of times with orchards
they'll plant a gill around the trees and
[SPEAKER_01]: literally just cut it down and lay it back
down right there in the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a couple here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular cultivar that we have is a
Russian cultivar called Baking 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sterile, so that means it's not going
to take over most people here in comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: They freak out and I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you do plant it, you're committing
to having it there for the rest of your
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: My employees screwed up in a few places
and now I can't get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the garden itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you dig around that area, just a
quarter of a root will form a new plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super easy to propagate, too,
once you have it in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the Russian cultivar the one,
though, that you want to be really careful
[SPEAKER_04]: about ingesting?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there are two basic types of
comfrey and there's one that you really
[SPEAKER_04]: want to be careful about ingesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read a lot of stuff on comfrey and
depending on which website you go to,
[SPEAKER_01]: some will say it has a low mammalian
toxicity and then other ones say it's this
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally don't ingest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do feed it in small amounts to our
animals and we haven't had any issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I couldn't comment on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things that I don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pants leave for roots and the root,
while it has great use topically,
[SPEAKER_07]: does have the stuff that you don't want to
ingest.
[SPEAKER_07]: That said, I've been growing it and eating
it for 30 years and I'm obviously good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the nutritional profile on comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find these for any plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a beautiful flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bees love it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Borage is another one I brought a few
plants out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another dynamic accumulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It self sows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherever you plant it, if you let it go to
seed, you'll have a ton of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to pull out, though,
so it's not a big deal if it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowers are actually wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a beautiful salad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't taste like anything,
but they look nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad grew a few plants a while back in
this tiny green house and we had some
[SPEAKER_01]: borage going around there and there on the
canvas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horsetail or equizetum is another one
that's high in silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, all these things claim to have
these nutrient profiles, but I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: think back to what Steve and these other
guys were saying are minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that soil is low in silica,
that equizetum is probably not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really high in it either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been reading some articles that
have been talking about silica as possibly
[SPEAKER_03]: becoming a new mapro nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before people had thought it was just
NPK and that was it, and now it's still
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to be thought of as being almost
as needed as NPK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you Google silicone, S-L-I-L-I-C-O-N,
the strange medium element, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful article that's talking about
what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a really, really important
under appreciated nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any issue with overdosing plants
with it or besides potassium blocking out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe with potassium silicate there is
because you're also applying potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I noticed with cannabis
especially is everyone likes potassium and
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems to really like silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen what those upper limits
necessarily are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things about this is it
is a balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're looking at your calcium and
magnesium ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's another one that's
being ironed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to go back and read a book for some
of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you have to process the horsetail,
compost it, whatever?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just put it in your soil around
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of these are either, you can use
them in a variety of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can just dry it and throw it right
on top as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can boil it and put it into a pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can leave it in a container with
water for an extended period of time in
[SPEAKER_01]: their water plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just extracting it over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it's as simple as just taking
the machete and cutting down the comfrey
[SPEAKER_01]: and then laying it right back down where
it came from around my crops a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Willow is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where aspirin comes from and
salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a wonderful rooting hormone,
natural rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take it with twigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually talk about it by sharing this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And create your own rooting hormone using
willow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a chart I got offline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just all I want to get out of this is that
there are a ton of different plants out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to share this with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's impossible to read it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for all these different types of
plants, they all have different nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: levels, provided that those nutrients are
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do see tobacco on here, or nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought a couple tobacco plants here to
half off for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really quickly, this is something that a
friend of mine down in Oregon discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: More people are talking about sprouted CTs
or barley CTs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, barley is really,
really high in enzymatic activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we use it for brewing beer,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you malt it, you're arresting
that endome at its highest enzymatic
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've done the work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually brought some barley to raffle
off today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, all you want to do is take it,
throw it in ideally a flour mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a blender or a coffee
grinder, throw it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then take it and sprinkle it over the
top of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you think about it,
that seed has everything that plant needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has all the enzymes and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially chitinase is one of the really
important US's partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chitinase is one of the main ways that the
plant protects itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we add crustacean meal and
different other aspects to our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that special barley?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it already malted?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can use any barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malted barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy it at your brewery store.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's malting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a commercial process that they
do to the barley.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you want to make sure to buy malted
barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy regular barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sprout it until the, I think it's
the Maristem, it's half the length of the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed husk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can grind it and then
immediately apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also just go out and buy
regular barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're like scientifically doing it
exactly right for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to put it in water and let
it sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a mistake I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: These enzymes break down quite rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You literally want to just put it right
onto the soil and water it as a really
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap, affordable thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend Jim, who was the one who
taught me about this, I'm doing trials on
[SPEAKER_01]: it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he claims 15% sooner flower time for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he hasn't had any issues, he says,
with power ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are pretty big claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a very affordable way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know guys putting as much as two cups a
week on a 30-gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a top dress on the soil,
not application on the plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're literally just sprinkling on top of
the soil after you grind it and then
[SPEAKER_01]: watering it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biochar, apparently as we talk out here,
on that, essentially it's based on terra
[SPEAKER_01]: preta, this idea of Amazonian soils that
were enhanced over time through the
[SPEAKER_01]: breakdown of carbon and manures and
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't a big fan of biochar at first and
started learning more and more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing it does is erase the CC,
or essentially the cathode exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity or the ability of the soil to
hold on to nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is our soil, both of these
photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our soil with 10% added biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we make a biochar soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my buddy at Goldleaf Gardens sent this
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really shocked me on the first cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought the main benefit of biochar
would be over time as it breaks down and
[SPEAKER_01]: helps retain nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really does seem to be a pretty
amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just charcoal, it's
pyrolysis, which means really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really high heat at very, very low oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my dad getting continued film for
making biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a good example of a burn in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just burning up a bunch of juniper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't see that much ash or white
stuff on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the design that he used.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd sometimes leave it and just put
holes in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's trying to take this concept over
to China as a way of increasing soil
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility over there, conditioning the
compost teas in some of these villages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a barrier on the outside,
but then it's the way the air goes through
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you Google Contiki kiln, you can read
all about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know a lot about the physical
properties of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was totally my dad's project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We buy our biochar from a company called
Black Owl Biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't make our own for our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last thing, and I'll go really
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biological horticulture for cannabis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this one from Gold Leaf Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a 502.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it says all organic growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using our biochar soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here they have a micro clover as a living
cover crop for their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're putting into our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to talk about what all these
things are, but I think I'm out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of them up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Tapp, why don't you go ahead and go
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been taking questions that we've
been going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just go into the question time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go really fast there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last thing, starting with peat
moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like peat moss over cocoa because it has
a little bit higher kind of exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest reason I like it is because it
contains existing microbial life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tested it with my buddy Tim Wilson
under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa cord is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both have sustainability issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I personally prefer peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we use it in our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use this 50% of our total energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only non-fish compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a two to three year age fish compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do use some post-consumer waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use some yard clippings, not
post-consumer waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not using food scraps.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was curious about the
plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just talking to the guy today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard to find high quality compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the best I've been able to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an example of it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used it in my room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earthworm castings, which I didn't
discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially warm poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Volcanic plumice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an aeration source similar to perlite
without being heated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's what adds porosity or aeration
because it might need that in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer it over perlite because it
doesn't rise in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer it over perlite because it
doesn't rise in the soil like perlite
[SPEAKER_01]: does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Micro catalyst is a product that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what we use when we make compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting it in our soil as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at the palatial rock dust and
the salt, those are mineral things adding
[SPEAKER_01]: trace minerals to our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the things that we were talking about
there with mineral balancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calphos is a soft rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a calcium and phosphorus source
that's also mined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oyster shell flour is a mined calcium
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could also use agricultural line,
which we have down below too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whichever one is cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alfalfa meal is probably my second
favorite amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very low in nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably on 1% nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're picking up something called
triacontinol, which is a plant growth
[SPEAKER_01]: hormone, which plants really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you always hear about people
using roses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a wonderful microbial food like
molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get new, wonderful compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just increases your beneficial
microbial activity in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fishbone meal is a phosphorus source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crustacean meal is a wonderful source of
slow release nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about that chitinase
enzyme that brings down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important for disease
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelp meal we're going to talk about a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neem cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neem cake is a holy grail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lovely treat out of India that is
slow release nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it also is a wonderful bacterial
food that I found.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just testing that with a microscope
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can take a couple cups of neem
cake, put it in water, solubilize it over
[SPEAKER_01]: a day or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll kill all fungus net larvae for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a wonderfully affordable fungus
net remedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Karonga cake is also out of India.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another nitrogen source as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish meal is a fast release nitrogen
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feather meal is a slow release nitrogen
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bone meal's got a little phosphorus in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcite and N-Y are just calcium sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have mycorrhizal on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I wouldn't consider this a
mycorrhizal application.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I have an asterisk tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're putting specifically
into our soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different ways to make
your own soil mix as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this will just give you an idea of
some of the varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I do like to caution people
on is azomite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite high in aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever I see a soil test for someone
using azomite, I can usually tell right
[SPEAKER_01]: away just by looking at the aluminum
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's better options,
especially locally when we talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: mining things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the guy bringing glacial rock dust
is coming out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the basalt's coming out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're locally quite geographically
close to us too, which makes the local
[SPEAKER_01]: more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is a crop that's over four
years old here that was grown by a friend
[SPEAKER_01]: of mine for under $50 in nutrients per
yard of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was averaging about 1.2 to 1.6
pounds per light growing in this style.
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally all you do is you harvest
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you yank it out, shake off whatever
soil is on the roots, and take it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you bring it back in a little bit
of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of it we have our nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially, it's a combination of
those nutrient ingredients that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: re-amend the soil with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 24 hours later, you're replanting
back into that soil, into your flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it becomes a much more ecological and
sustainable way of growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you tilling that stuff back into the
soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you actually just top-dressing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not literally tilling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're disturbing the first few inches of
the soil, which are naturally designed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be disturbed anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had multiple discussions with a
friend of mine on whether or not that's
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are likely disturbing the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of what it is to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not like digging it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what a room like that would look
like under, say, AutoCAD or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're filling the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're adding loads of straw to those
beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what I think the most
efficient way of growing is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we really promote for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once that soil is in place,
we're not having to move it in and out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can lightly amend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything stays put.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is a Shopping Goldie Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one of our favorite growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are doing four-by-four beds on
pallets that they literally did move those
[SPEAKER_01]: pallets around the facility as they
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually getting up to three
pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using Yevina double-ended hoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're using CO2 as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say that this style of growing
can't produce the same levels as
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would disagree.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydroponics suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a slow guy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is Jai checking the light levels
with his meter on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last thing I want to talk
about here is blue mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anyone heard of blue mats?
[SPEAKER_01]: They are auto-waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this little carrot here, there's no
electronics whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It measures the moisture tension in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can control through these
drippers how much water comes out by
[SPEAKER_01]: turning the little knob on top right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have this hooked up to a
reservoir in this photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just filled it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gravity fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I've dialed it in where I want it
to, you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to water your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes care of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a guy leave to Alaska and I came
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: His plants were touching the lights,
which was a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, after being gone for a month and
having his wife fill the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can hook it up to a main line.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important thing with these soils
is water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping the soil even and moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found if you get a moisture meter
from this company and you keep it between
[SPEAKER_01]: 80 and 120 mbar, you really keep that
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You end up with a much, much better crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than if you have wet dry cycles or you're
not consistent with your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want to stress the plants out
dramatically with our water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to stress these microphones
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's just some examples of some hybrid
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are spraying chemicals,
or not spraying chemicals, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: applying ionic salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're throwing the soil after every run,
but they're still using a high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in our biochar soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy's had a bumper crop with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he saw the same issues then of
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're having to throw away the soil
every cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Green Rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a tier three.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a phenomenal job too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're also throwing out the soil
every run as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a better photographer than
we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's some resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiss Organics is our online store.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to read more about these
amendments or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a description under every
amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiss Farms is our store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Law School Garden is a free form
that I have with Tim Wilson.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sign up or look at free
information on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the Oregon Department of Ag list on
that website right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the two books I talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is my contact info if you have
any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the folks that are the kind of
people who don't like to interrupt the
[SPEAKER_00]: speaker, I want to give you a chance to
ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get three questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who's got a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your master's in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Special education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil is just something I'm really
passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about developing a symbiotic
relationship with the microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a best time to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are there fancy issues to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're going to do it, is there a
better time to try and commit those or add
[SPEAKER_01]: those?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be more like a mentality
or a paradigm in terms of how we're always
[SPEAKER_01]: treating the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm looking at soil and treating
soil, what I'm thinking about is that
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial interaction and that activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm always cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm less concerned with what's going on
above ground as I am below ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think it's kind of just a
mental switch that is rooted in what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: suggesting for people regarding plants and
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something you're always trying to
do with micro-agriculture, with quality
[SPEAKER_01]: input, with compost, with airing the
compost piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: You touched on bacteria and fungi,
but you didn't really touch on protozoa a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about their nitrogen-fixing
abilities and how that works?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main function, as I understand it,
is that the protozoa, the phlegm,
[SPEAKER_01]: saline, saline, they're very, very good at
consuming bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when they excrete or when they
die, does that plant demand more nitrogen
or nutrient?
That's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were to brew a tea earlier in
the production of the plant in veg,
[SPEAKER_03]: would that protozoa dominant tea be
beneficial for increasing nitrogen for the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant naturally, or would that be
detrimental to increasing the burn at your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen a properly made compost
tea burn a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really can't over-reply to what's made
directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, so when you first start
brewing compost tea, let's say 70 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: good brewer, good oxygen, you're looking
at around 24 to 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of that optimal window where you
have all the diversity that that thing can
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you start moving further out towards 48
hours, you'll start to see one species of
[SPEAKER_01]: protozoa, one type of phlegm with its
specific morphology, and you'll see one
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria that will just kind of take turns
going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always aim for that 24 to 36 hour window
for the most part, depending on what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't try to make a bacterial tea or a
fungal tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just try to make a nutrients tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would make my tea the same for compost
teas when I'm talking about beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms, and then you could cater
your nutrient teas or plant teas more
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically towards that stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny, why don't you beat the last
question, then we'll move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was curious if you know anything about
probiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, even in terms of these sorts of
microorganisms, or like with humans,
[SPEAKER_01]: or... There's a way to grow a base of
probiotics, and I'm curious if you know
[SPEAKER_01]: anything about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a forum on Facebook that's a
probiotic farmers association.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're primarily focused on a lot of
anaerobic microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makashi and Ian, which I'm not as familiar
with, they're anaerobic microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know if that term has been
defined yet for gardening or farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a lot of these things I would say are
friendly towards that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us who are not ultra nerds on
it, like people like me, I booked it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotic growing speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for most of us, we would call this
entire presentation probiotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the idea is about creating the
plant to be as healthy as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you don't have to add all these
non-natural inputs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making the plant healthier by
feeding the soil, and the soil takes care
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much the whole presentation
loosely would be considered probiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
