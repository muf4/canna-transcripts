[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere you look, cannabis enthusiasts,
patients, and consumers are turning away
[SPEAKER_00]: from pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most pesticides approved for growing food
are not approved for use with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yet there they are in the market all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These food crop pesticides may be tested
as safe enough in very low doses when
[SPEAKER_00]: watered down and outside in the rain on
food products, but most have never been
[SPEAKER_00]: tested to be burned and inhaled and filled
into the lungs like cannabis often is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even more so when concentrated like
cannabis oil for dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides run the range of risk from
untested for safety when growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way to specifically toxic when
used in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crazy thing is that some people,
and even companies, still use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers have grown accustomed to
relying on chemical pesticides when they
[SPEAKER_00]: get spider mites or russet mite or any one
of the nasty bugs that attack cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nearly nobody wants to use the sketchy
pesticides, but some growers just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the experience to rely solely on
holistic horticulture practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's too bad, too, because people
have been growing without chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that cannabis happens to be in a
pocket of modern agriculture that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: late to adopt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The damn thing is that many states are not
even testing regulated cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do it on an honor system,
and that sure has not worked out well so
[SPEAKER_00]: far.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the state does not test for
pesticides, it pretty much makes a mockery
[SPEAKER_00]: of the legal system's claim to provide a
superior product to the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the legal market right now,
you still have to know your grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's the same thing as unregulated
medical was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis consumers are beginning to get
educated, though, about pesticides and
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide regulation and are starting to
demand cannabis grown without pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: and using other sustainable growing
methods like using living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis growers with vision, though,
have seen this coming for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and many growers are already migrating
away from pesticides and are leading the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry with really clean cannabis
products that consumers flock to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about working
with nature instead of against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about using beneficial
insects as allies to eat the bugs that are
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there really is a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some bugs will defend your garden instead
of destroy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a well-established
agricultural practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just new to cannabis, like so many
other things now that cannabis is being
[SPEAKER_00]: normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to encourage you to use
bugs, not drugs, to defend your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Shane Young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane founded Natural Enemies in 2014 to
focus on encouraging the use of beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects in commercial cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to that, Shane managed acres and
acres and acres of ornamental greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: for a greenhouse growers magazine top 25
horticulture company.
[SPEAKER_00]: After personally designing, transitioning,
and running the company's successful
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects program, he chose to
switch gears and bring his expertise to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry to help producers
reduce residual pesticides in medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Shane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to connect again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have you back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for most growers familiar
with using insects at all, they're used to
[SPEAKER_00]: using ladybugs and praying mantis to fight
pests in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the advantages to cannabis
growers to move beyond using these
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional bugs and using a wider range
of beneficial insects like the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental horticulture industry does?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you talk about praying mantis and
ladybugs, those are kind of generalists,
[SPEAKER_01]: per se, that, you know, they'll feed on
many different things that may be in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not be as aggressive as some of
the species that we carry, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do at this stage is there's very
specific predatory mites that are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: used for, you know, the pest concerns that
people have in their operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the biggest thing that we go
into is we start from the bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, fungus net issues, root aphids
and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes into broad mite and russet
mites are completely tearing companies
[SPEAKER_01]: apart because of how difficult it is to
figure out what you have because the
[SPEAKER_01]: magnification is so small to see these
pests in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you still have the common ones,
you know, two-spot spider mite,
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips, a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the species that we carry are very
specific and I guess they're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultured specifically for one job in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, what the pests are
that people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't I want a more generalized
insect to be working for me instead of a
[SPEAKER_00]: specialist so that it just, you know,
I can use one insect and it gets rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: all my bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that just unrealistic?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's nothing wrong with
having a generalist out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's helpful in a lot of
different situations, I guess you'd say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have a specialist,
you know, they have one main job and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's to get rid of the pests that you
have that you're most concerned with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you have a ladybug and praying
mantis, they're not going to do a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: lot for the microscopic mites that you're
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to use specific species that
are geared towards your specific pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eradication comes about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They clean things up a lot quicker,
basically, rather than just a generalist
[SPEAKER_01]: that's roaming around eating, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know that you just mentioned a few
of the pests that you deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to get a better picture of what
kind of pests beneficial insects can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used against.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, every grower pretty much has
got their arch enemy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that they've been trying to get
rid of on and off for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, can you give me an idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just name off some of the most common
pests that you are working with so people
[SPEAKER_00]: get an idea of, oh, all right,
the one that I'm concerned about is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been fairly simple to,
you know, compile this list of what
[SPEAKER_01]: people's concerns are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, coming from traditional egg,
it was, you know, very common pests in
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture versus when I come into
cannabis, it seems like one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: common pests that we encounter,
again, are from the rooting system,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biggest thing about those is that
the larval stages of those will feed on
[SPEAKER_01]: your rooting system of your plants,
which, you know, I believe is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most important part of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously the flower on the back
end is great, but, you know, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have healthy plants moving into,
you know, from mother to veg into your
[SPEAKER_01]: flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plant health is number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fungus gnats, I don't think anybody
should take lightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they spread diseases, they carry
other pests with them, and they can spread
[SPEAKER_01]: to a room and, you know, and can become a
real issue if you don't take care of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing about that is what I
learned is the amount of watering,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that the cannabis plant demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It amazed me because I had never cultured,
you know, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never grown it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just recall working with one of the
502 growers in Washington where I gave
[SPEAKER_01]: them soil mites to take care of their
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: To take care of their fungus gnats issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, two weeks later he called
me back and told me I was full of shit
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, God, I'm like, the only
reason I know these don't work is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they could freeze or they could
drown out basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, dude, he's like,
do you know how much water we're feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: our plants at this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when he told me a gallon of
water for a three gallon bucket every two
[SPEAKER_01]: days possibly, my first thought was that
we were pushing out reproduction
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ran some trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did additional applications to be
effective with these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungus gnats, but, you know, what's
tearing people apart is root aphids as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are huge pests that people have
problems with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm always honest with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to be one of the most difficult
to get rid of, to eradicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally when we work with people,
we talk about sanitation first.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about scoping their soil that
they're bringing in basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because eggs can be in that
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rather than trying to cure them of a
situation with our product, we try to get
[SPEAKER_01]: to the root of it on, you know,
what steps need to be taken first before
[SPEAKER_01]: we start using our product moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it comes to rates at that stage
to be effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fungus gnats, root aphids in the soil
is common, is very common on what we deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving forward from there, like I had
mentioned earlier, you know, two spot
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mite has to be one of the most
common pests, whether it's in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: or...
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the poster boy of bugs in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fairly common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody should know what a two
spot spider mite looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very visible by the eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to tell what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pest identification is simple,
but yeah, it's been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, you know, thrips are very
common as well in agricultural crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of if it's cannabis or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a couple of the most difficult as well
has been broad mites and hemp russet mite
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I spoke about two spot
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can easily identify them because you
can see them with your eye, depends on how
[SPEAKER_01]: old you are, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, for the most part,
you're gonna need a scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna need a high powered scope to
take a look at these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what we've gathered, 60 plus
magnification is what's needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, my old position as a plant
health manager, I had the luxury of being
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 minutes away from Oregon State
University, had a research facility next
[SPEAKER_01]: to us, an extension service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to touch base on,
you know, what they use in research for
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the field and, you know,
in their offices when they have things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I started about 10 years
ago is using specific scopes and able to
[SPEAKER_01]: have pests identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's actually coming up more that I
really didn't focus very much on is foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably been about in the last three
and a half years, 1% of one of the pests
[SPEAKER_01]: that we deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, this last year,
it seems to be like there was a string of
[SPEAKER_01]: growers that continually ran into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that is because of our
reach at this point as a company on how
[SPEAKER_01]: many people that we work with,
where we are receiving more calls about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just seems like it's a growing pest
concern with people as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my experience supports what
you're saying about the once you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: roof aphids or some kind of infestation in
the substrate that things can go to hell
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, once they're in the
roots, the whole plant starts to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little, you know, sick and lackadaisical,
which creates an opportunity for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, secondary pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we can consider the root pests to
be like the gateway pest, which breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: down the Trojan horse through the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these secondary pests come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that happening at the
commercial level as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you hit it right on the head,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I spoke about previous,
a healthy plant, you know, sanitation from
[SPEAKER_01]: the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the key steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not one thing that you do in pest
management that's going to take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: all your problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole slew of things that go into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sanitation, general plant
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a problem in your rooting
system and you have a weak plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically it's opening itself up to other
issues concerning secondary could be
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be additional pests because,
you know, it's kind of like you and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we're sick, we're not at our best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, there's no way for us to fight
off other things, except we got to get
[SPEAKER_01]: through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, at the commercial scale,
for sure, man, I think people are still
[SPEAKER_01]: going through, you know, even though I
guess recreational use has or cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: has been around for, you know,
four to five years, maybe six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't recall when it passed in Colorado,
but you know, all these people are still
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring out how to grow at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I can't imagine it being an easy
task at all when you're used to growing 20
[SPEAKER_01]: plants or 50 or whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now you have to manage a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't just get to be with your plants
every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing other things as well,
even though you're head of cultivation or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just IPM management, whatever the
company may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many things that need to be
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we work with people as 50,000
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can't imagine even doing that
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, definitely, you know,
to answer your question in a roundabout
[SPEAKER_01]: way, plant health is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the key things in using an
integrated approach to pest management
[SPEAKER_01]: with beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you hit it right on the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're using beneficial insects to
defend your garden, do you use that
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some growers do where you leave a
couple of sick plants around as
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrificial lambs to attract the pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does that just create an environment
for new and secondary and original pests
[SPEAKER_00]: to come into your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the way that I have always been
trained is if you have a weak plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to contaminate anything
else in your room because it could bring
[SPEAKER_01]: it to your plant, but also the
surroundings of the plant that's sick,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just training of mind has always been
cleaning up leaves, dead leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: dead twigs, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a sick plant, get it out of there,
you know, cut your losses sometimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, and just get rid of it may make
things a lot easier for you moving
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, I would get rid of
it, then try to save it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you talk about sacrificial
plants, you can use companion plants or
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial plants, basically, that can and
this may be outdoors where you can where
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of invites beneficial insects or
the natural, you know, predatory predatory
[SPEAKER_01]: insects from the outside into your garden
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoors, it's a little bit more difficult
when people are working in sealed rooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it kind of doesn't really make
sense indoors, but it can be helpful in
[SPEAKER_01]: the pots, you know, it goes back to plant
health quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the you know, the elephant
in the room, as far as like adoption of
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects, always seems to be
growers who have relied so heavily on
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical pesticides for all these years
growing underground during the prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: era, you know, indoors, that that they
have they've worked out their tech,
[SPEAKER_00]: they know their schedule, they and they're
like, you know, they depend on it to
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and now, because of the huge pushback,
both by state regulators and by individual
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers who don't want chemical
pesticides sprayed on the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly now, you know, a lot of these
traditional growers are being pushed to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to consider beneficial insects and
give up the bottles that they've you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've wedded for all of these
years, you know, what do you say to these
[SPEAKER_00]: growers that are clutching on to their
chemical pesticides to help move their
[SPEAKER_00]: heart, if you will, away from using what
they've relied on, move them towards what
[SPEAKER_00]: is a more holistic solution and working
with nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get them over the hump of
belief?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's obviously something that we deal
with on a daily basis, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, not to defend people who
want to use sprays in their garden because
[SPEAKER_01]: things have worked well in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, to say something about
that, a lot of people, that's been their
[SPEAKER_01]: only option.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they're that's what they know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how people are trained at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, being at the company I was at
previous to mine, you know, we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: preventative spray program for 28 years
that was in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my my reach or my jump into beneficial
insects was the ineffectiveness of sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was worker safety that I was concerned
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was managing people around sprays and
not growing plants anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to kind of answer your question,
we don't I guess I'd say education is
[SPEAKER_01]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not here to try to talk somebody into
using our product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to give them information on the
benefits of using our product,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and the species that we have and
and what we can do for you and with you
[SPEAKER_01]: and how that transitions to, you know,
health all around, whether it's your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants or, you know, the consumers who use
it on the back end as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously, you know,
past pesticide testing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a huge thing that is coming up
in the industry that's going to be looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not coming up has been around for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's continually looked at on a daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always, you know, not just me,
but my guys in the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I might have chosen these
words from you in the past in
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation, Shango, that, you know,
it's even on our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's choose beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell my guys, we're not here to hard
sell people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here to educate them first on what
can be used for their specific pest
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns, you know, and then moving
forward, let's hold their hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions that people have that come
up, you know, whether you've been using
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrols for two years or 10,
I still get calls from people that I set
[SPEAKER_01]: up a program four years ago that have been
a customer for a while that have a
[SPEAKER_01]: question that comes up, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of it is experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the biggest hurdle besides the
skepticism of it actually being an
[SPEAKER_01]: effective pest management tool is is the
way that you kind of have to see to
[SPEAKER_01]: believe type thing like it actually works
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll hit that part even harder,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me an example or two of a big
commercial grow that has made the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of folks, they're just
afraid of jumping without a parachute or
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling like if they start making the
transition and it doesn't work out that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to lose the whole crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, give me a win success story here so
people can kind of picture how it works at
[SPEAKER_00]: the commercial level.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second part of the show,
we'll talk more about walking somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: through the transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just jump to the end and give me an
explanation of a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's funny you bring that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and before the show, I was as we
were speaking about a new hire of mine
[SPEAKER_01]: that I have, you know, he was an indoor
tier three producer in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know this until he was
actually working in my office.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I recall, I think it was December of
last year when I started working with his
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, Shane, you know, what can we
do for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's our problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I map out controls that usually when I
tell people if it was me, this is how I
[SPEAKER_01]: would approach it, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the species to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what's going to be aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the days to order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's how much to order, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I think is going to be
effective for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that stage, he kind of took it and
ran with it, calls me a week later,
[SPEAKER_01]: asked a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within two months, he had a full
transformation of, you know, when I say
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals, I use that term loosely as just
sprays, but they were using Omri listed
[SPEAKER_01]: organic sprays, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times are oil based,
which are, you know, immediate
[SPEAKER_01]: gratification.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dissipates quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within a couple of months,
we had fully transformed him over fast
[SPEAKER_01]: forward into I just hired him two months
ago to represent me in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, you know, when I called you
a year ago, basically, he goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to I had to give my owner a
guarantee that your product was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, you never guaranteed that your
product was work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually told me this isn't a
guarantee, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is what I think is going to
be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, here's here's what I would use and
what we would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he ran with it from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, in our previous conversation,
it seems like a company needs to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: guy there that is really interested in
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's an owner that's pushing his
head grow or to to do something else that
[SPEAKER_01]: that is out of their comfort level,
then sometimes it's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to lay things out up front
towards people on where their roadblocks
[SPEAKER_01]: may come in at where we might have
problems, because I don't want to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: guarantee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it starts out with education.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's an easy story to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: As this guy tells me as he works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I basically told the owner
that I was going to guarantee that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, basically, crossing fingers,
everything worked out real well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's no issues at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that was that was a great
success story in my head after hearing
[SPEAKER_01]: from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of went behind my back and made
the guarantee on his own to his owner and
[SPEAKER_01]: not for me, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's there's so many variables to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you really do need somebody on the
inside who's going to be dedicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: learning a little bit about it and and
paying attention to it because it's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, while it is a a comprehensive
solution and works really effectively,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not like a real simple plug and play.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't like a set it and forget it kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like, you know, most solutions for for
for a big garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to you have to massage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is Shane Young,
founder of Natural Enemies Biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a listener of Shaping Fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: by out competing potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy mammoth pea near you, check out
[SPEAKER_00]: their website at www.mammothmicrobes.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partner with microorganisms to create
beautiful, thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow cannabis with sunshine,
you can often feel limited by the seasonal
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grow sustainably and save
money, so you use as little electricity as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you haven't studied or implemented
light deprivation techniques into your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, you're leaving a lot of money
on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: By incorporating light deprivation
solutions into your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can often add two or three additional
growing cycles to your year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pencil out the financial benefit
of those additional cycles, you'll realize
[SPEAKER_00]: why commercial scale light deprivation
technology is remaking the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because light deprivation
technology has been used in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What used to be done by pulling tarps over
hoop houses has been scaled up over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few years in such a way that it's
become mechanized, easy, and affordable to
[SPEAKER_00]: even small scale commercial cannabis
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever Flowering Greenhouses is the
industry leader in light deprivation
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse design and operation for the
commercial cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their team of greenhouse experts have been
in the fields of Northern California for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades, and they're now building
greenhouses for commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are new to light dep and growing in
greenhouses, I encourage you to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire episode 13 with guest Eric
Branstad of Forever Flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk with Eric about the importance of
intelligent greenhouse management,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the huge financial benefit of
incorporating light dep techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many aspects of utilizing a
greenhouse that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: From temperature and airflow to light dep
and workflow, Forever Flowering will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you produce crop after crop of well cared
for flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help you retrofit your existing
greenhouse with light dep and other modern
[SPEAKER_00]: systems at a level that fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just starting out, Forever
Flowering can help you plan and build your
[SPEAKER_00]: new greenhouse so that you get started on
the right foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis business has enough risks
without trying to go it alone with your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact Forever Flowering Greenhouses to
partner with folks who have an
[SPEAKER_00]: indisputable reputation as knowledgeable
and easy to work with.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shane Golos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is Shane Young,
founder of Natural Enemies Bio Control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set of the show,
we talked about the approach to beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and what they are and why they can
be a great teammate for defending your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've kind of given everybody
an idea of what beneficial insects are
[SPEAKER_00]: about, let's talk about thinking through
the story problem of introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects to a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go and you meet with a new
client, I'm sure that you walk them
[SPEAKER_00]: through a first couple steps so you can
figure out whether or not the garden is an
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate target for beneficial insects
and to kind of think through what the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition will even look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you walk all of us through that so
that people can consider it for their own
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, most gardens are a
proponent or can be used with beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it has to do with people's pest
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we spoke about their specific
species that go after certain pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it seems like companies
that culture or culture beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects, they've been around for 30 plus
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it isn't anything new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's a matter of education on
showing a customer what can be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just what that we run into,
but we also pride ourselves on giving
[SPEAKER_01]: people the why.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want people to come to us and be
like, tell me what to do, give them
[SPEAKER_01]: something to do, and they don't take any,
you know, they don't take any steps on
[SPEAKER_01]: their own to make sure it's working right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to provide them what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to provide them why to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we leave a lot of work on them as
well, because it's not like what you said
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you said it and forget about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sprays isn't that way either.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of monitoring that goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when we walk into a
facility, it's, you know, obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: introductions, it's pest concerns,
it's, you know, where do we start and what
[SPEAKER_01]: do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my biggest thing with people is or
with companies is obviously, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to start with your mother plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to start with your veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to we don't want to start at
the very end where you're having spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mite problems, you know, seven weeks in
the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what do I do at this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of leave them on their own for
that to figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we can be helpful as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what state they're in and
what they can and can't use, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So walking into a facility, it's again,
just gathering information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fact finding to see what their
production is like, see what their
[SPEAKER_01]: protocol is, see what they've been doing
in the past and, you know, why they're
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to us to really formulate a plan to
be helpful to these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when I talk about what
sprays they've used in the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some chemicals that can be used
that will actually deter predatory mites
[SPEAKER_01]: from even coming in and helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's upfront information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when to use it, how to use it
properly and where to begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally try to talk people into
regardless of how big a company is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you obviously want to jump in
right away and take care of all their
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms, you know, that they have problems
with or are interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we actually try to start with people
in their mother rooms and if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing that with a veg as well,
because if you start out clean and your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is healthy and you push that into
flower, you know, chances are there
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't be too many issues going into
the last flowering stages there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have somebody that is,
again, interested in doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want somebody to take responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want people to scout and monitor and
tell us what they're seeing so that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we can make our comments on what
they're seeing and why that is basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always the what, it's always the
why, you know, why they're seeing this
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being informational to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting because what you're
describing is a balance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to continually course correct as
you go so that you can keep this balance
[SPEAKER_00]: where the plants are healthy and the
beneficial insects are able to do their
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just keep the population of the pests
as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that it never goes to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about keeping them in control.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you touched on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have different types of customers
and we have customers who want zero
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where I came from, zero tolerance was
not feasible, but I kind of disagree with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pay enough and you use enough
species and predators a specific amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you're not going to have any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of companies that,
you know, rather than using the scouting
[SPEAKER_01]: and monitoring technique, they would
rather pay more upfront with us to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the specific program in place where they
don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that concerns me because regardless of
how much you put in, there could always be
[SPEAKER_01]: something else that may come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're using a species that's
specific for thrips, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you're getting spider mites or vice
versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's real difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just have different ways of
approaching pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called pest management for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's monitoring, you know, populations of
good versus the bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, do I need to make a
decision?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what product do I use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it slow release sachet or is it active
adults, you know, to help clean up my area
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that's where we come in to be
helpful with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard people poo poo beneficial
insects about how they're not a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my thought is, you know, the people
that I know who say, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they spray enough to feel like they're
at a hundred percent, they're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves at risk with other plant
problems because they're spraying so much,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, especially if they, you know,
if they're, if they're spraying oils and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're moving towards bloom, you know,
you use this example that I found very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, you know, you want to start with
the mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get them early because you don't
want to end up in week seven of bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: with, with spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what if you do find yourself at
week seven with spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can beneficial insects be used for a,
like an acute hot problem now in bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like at the end or, or is it,
is it too late at that point for
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects to have helped?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, you really have to start early in
your cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing to comment on well,
is when you say people poo poo,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, beneficial insects, you know,
that's why I got into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because my spray program wasn't as
effective as I thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, there's two, there's two sides
of the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously you can spray and still have
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use beneficial insects and still
have problems with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just want to comment on that
off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what transitioned to me on
beneficial use is because the spray
[SPEAKER_01]: program I had put in place actually,
I was like, God, I just sprayed a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of days ago and I still have mites over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's a better way of dealing with
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's more effective, what's healthy,
you know, to the safety, what's healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: and safety and safe, you know,
for employees that you have is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is looking for something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it goes back to education on
that fast forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: To your next question on, you know,
what if you do find yourself in bloom in
[SPEAKER_01]: week seven and you're cropping out in
eight weeks, you know, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be forward with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's difficult to take care of a problem
at that stage with beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have a very limited pool of
what you can pull to use that for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the times the predatory mites are,
they find it very difficult to crawl
[SPEAKER_01]: across, you know, the flower and the
trichomes, you know, you, you,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can imagine a tiny little insect
trying to climb across, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hairy plants and then you, and then you
add the stickiness of the flower into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an unfriendly environment,
number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that comes before it gets to that
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the monitoring and scouting
comes in on, you know, if we have any
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, let's take care of it before it
really gets into this stage at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of products that we do
use that I call our flyers versus
[SPEAKER_01]: predatory mites that are roaming around
the canopy of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, all honesty shango,
I tell people, Mike, you can use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously there's no guarantees going into
it and it's going to cost you a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money, you know, to clean up a situation
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you need to understand that
there's also a life cycle of pests that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you introduce a beneficial insect
or a predatory bug, I guess you would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not like they sit there and eat all
day long until your pests are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they have a resting phase
similar as we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to rest, then they need to
reproduce and be able to eat again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so yeah, I mean, it is difficult
at that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell people, you know, physical removal
might be your best bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than buying product from me,
why don't you use one of your company
[SPEAKER_01]: employees, you know, you can use a low
powered vacuum cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can physically remove them with,
you know, paper cloth towels that are wet,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, do you have any plants that
we have problems with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, you know, this could
have been prevented basically with
[SPEAKER_01]: different techniques heading up to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like, so yeah, if you have an
acute problem right before you harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you can throw money and beneficials
at it and labor and do your best for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, you know, you may want to just
start with your mother plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that the cycle that you're in
right now may not be as successful as you
[SPEAKER_00]: want, but start on the next cycle and be
forward looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you said something else that I
found really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the reasons why some
people push against beneficials is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes are so sticky and they're so
effective at gumming up and grabbing
[SPEAKER_00]: insects that people say to me,
you know, why would I want to add more
[SPEAKER_00]: insects to my garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then my final product is going to
have more dead captured insects in the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people ask you about that,
what do you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to laugh, number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, man, you know, and again,
and I hate to keep preaching the same
[SPEAKER_01]: words, but education becomes first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, you know, a lot of the times,
like I said, it's an unfriendly
[SPEAKER_01]: environment for them where we physically
we've watched these things because the
[SPEAKER_01]: natural searching of a predatory mite in
general, you know, if it's on your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: or canopy is to go upwards, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recall being in Portland here one
time and a guy called me as I came in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what we're doing is not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to make sure that we're doing
it at the right stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is when I started out four years
ago in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember walking over to this place
and literally releasing a species called
[SPEAKER_01]: persimilus, excuse me, for two spots,
spider mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instantly I basically just watched it
climb up the stem and it gets to the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower and it turns right back down and
then it climbs right back up and goes
[SPEAKER_01]: down, up and down, up and down,
up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically it's going to die of
exhaustion a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people are concerned about species
or predatory mites getting stuck in their
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, for the most part, they don't go
there, I guess you would say, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult for them and it's really hard
for them to thrive and even move anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: in that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can recall in the last four years
doing this of pictures of people sending
[SPEAKER_01]: predatory mites, like pictures of their
flower to me and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, man, this is stuck in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, because there were new
customers of mine and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: God, that looks like a predatory mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've literally seen that picture one
time, I guess you'd say in four years
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's stuck on a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other time it wasn't a predatory
mite, it was actually a minute pirate bug
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's called Oreos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Oreos was stuck directly in the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: My customer pulled the Oreos out and there
was a spider mite in there that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: going after basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got kind of stuck in like a hole
basically going after it in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, other than that, I haven't
received any responses from people that
[SPEAKER_01]: what you gave me is not working out
because it's ending up in our flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ending up in our buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of just suggests it's a growing
myth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That, yeah, we've all seen, you know,
bugs, usually flying bugs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, but you're saying, yeah,
that's not the bugs that we're adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you've seen bugs caught in
your trichomes doesn't mean that these are
[SPEAKER_00]: the same bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same beneficial insects that
you're going to use to defend your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be a good way to say it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good way to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, things that you see that are
flying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the first thing that comes to mind
is fungus gnats, you know, and people have
[SPEAKER_01]: an outbreak of fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the bigger problems rather
than them spreading disease through the
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The adults that you have are more of a
nuisance in traditional egg, but in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, they get stuck to the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like it becomes a real pain in the
ass for people to deal with and work
[SPEAKER_01]: around at that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, a lot of the times what we
offer to people as product as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: we show them pictures of them,
images.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it is because we don't want
them to call us two weeks down the road
[SPEAKER_01]: and be like, God, I got this other pest,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll send us pictures and we're
like, no, these guys are on your side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is what we talked about two
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are your teammates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop killing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, be nice to those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, again, we're trying to
formulate as a company, be as helpful as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible to people, give them not as many
options as possible, really limited
[SPEAKER_01]: options on what we've seen to be most
effective in certain situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was one of the most
difficult things for me when I started out
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrollers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I learned a lot on my own,
but I had to go through so many resources,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people, a lot of time in order to
formulate what I thought was best for a
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something could be different based off
experience, you know, that you run into or
[SPEAKER_01]: other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, again, our company is
focused on being helpful to people,
[SPEAKER_01]: offering them education on what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I tell them, I'm like,
this is what we found to be most
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get information from somebody else
and it may be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great if it's helpful and
effective to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just kind of speak from
experiences, grow our feedback and
[SPEAKER_01]: personal experiences through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one hell of a sales cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you play this role of evangelist
and, you know, these are more than
[SPEAKER_00]: customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually, you know, getting into
partnership with these people because it
[SPEAKER_00]: has to evolve over months and there's a
lot of education back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I totally get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get down to some more nitty
gritty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once a grower has decided that they
want to make the transition from spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: to using beneficial insects, break it down
for me what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it as simple as, you know, day one
comes and the spraying is done and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the same day you release the beneficials?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there like a clean up the plants
period where the old pesticides have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, volatilize and go away before
you can add the beneficials?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we start to do with people is,
you know, keeping or speaking about what's
[SPEAKER_01]: already been spoken for is, you know,
sanitation, plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we also talk about and that's
changed, I feel, in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is this is my thoughts on
what's happening is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I came from traditional
agriculture, my rates for beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects were based off per acre,
whether it was 10, 20 or 30 thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: predatory mites per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the species I would use.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for, you know, the reason on how
they're going to help you, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started recommending cannabis,
it became difficult because that wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: working very well for me and I had to make
changes at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, number one is not
starting with your flower plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's starting from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what that does, it eliminates a
lot of cost with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives them a chance to work with things
slowly and see it as it walks through
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you know, mother plants to their
cuttings to veg before it gets into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you three or four weeks to kind
of have that education and balance and
[SPEAKER_01]: information on, you know, what to use and
how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk about pesticide use,
it's difficult to nail down like specific,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, do this one, two, three,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we do with people is we ask them
again, you know, what's your procedure has
[SPEAKER_01]: been like in the past?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your pest concerns, basically?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your pest level at this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and if they can't answer some of
these reasons, you can only give them a
[SPEAKER_01]: broad answer, I guess you'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the whole does the whole grow have to
be sprayed down and clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm assuming that, you know,
if they're spraying residual, they'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: residual pesticides on surfaces and those
would injure the newly introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't encourage people to spray
everything down to clean things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally think that has been used
differently by each company you work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: each person that you may work with at this
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to I prefer to have there be a
pest level of some stage so that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: food source for the predatory mites to
start working against, depending on what
[SPEAKER_01]: your pest is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than spraying something down to
clean it up, I mean, yes, you can approach
[SPEAKER_01]: it that way as well, but then you need to
wait X amount of days depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: product that you use because there are
residuals that are left over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you know, what's nice is seeing
what states are allowing cultivators to
[SPEAKER_01]: use at this stage, because a lot of it is
oil based, which dissipates quickly,
[SPEAKER_01]: which doesn't leave a whole lot of
residues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what I used to do about eight
years ago, starting to use it as I ran
[SPEAKER_01]: trials on what I sprayed and then sprayed
my plants with water just for hydration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps wash residuals off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you can, you know, take that from
seven days down to five days where we can
[SPEAKER_01]: apply the beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specific products is kind of what it's all
about, Shango, because there are things
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can spray a day before and then
release beneficial insects the next day or
[SPEAKER_01]: two days later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not be an insecticide per se,
maybe a bio insecticide, which are a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of active funguses that people can use
that do not leave residuals that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any, you know, re-entry hours after
you spray them, or it's limited to like
[SPEAKER_01]: four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really depends on what they've been
doing prior, you know, and kind of where
[SPEAKER_01]: their focus is on where they want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they really want to try this thing,
you know, if they really want to walk the
[SPEAKER_01]: walk, then, you know, we ask very specific
questions before we start working with
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most difficult thing is when people
call in and say, hey, can you send me some
[SPEAKER_01]: predatory mites?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, we can, you know,
help me out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened about three years ago is
we started creating what I call a new
[SPEAKER_01]: customer inquiry, which people can fill
out online, and that basically gives us
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the information that we need to be
helpful with you and to show you how to
[SPEAKER_01]: walk from step one to step two to step
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're using avid or orthine
or using something like this, residuals
[SPEAKER_01]: may be longer than if you're, hey man,
I just use, you know, I just use
[SPEAKER_01]: botanogard on my product, which is an
active fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we could probably start the very
next day or two days later, you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the new customer inquiry really gives
us information needed to be helpful to
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they can start, what they can
use, and kind of what to expect moving
[SPEAKER_01]: forward in a program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, as we've gone on,
I know that it pains you to go back again
[SPEAKER_00]: and again to the idea of the education
aspect, and that's how primary that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more you talk, the more I get it,
that each grow really is its own
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, and what they're spraying is
a variable, and there's just so many
[SPEAKER_00]: variables that is not one solution fits
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really it's about getting in and
participating with them to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: their program's going to be, and then
doing the transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna talk more about the transition,
and especially about application rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we need to take our second break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna take that break and be
right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is Shane Young,
[SPEAKER_00]: founder of Natural Enemies Biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis normalization sweeps the
country, knowledge of how to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally and without synthetic inputs has
become more and more available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, probiotic growers are
experiencing large yields and exceptional
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles without using chemicals
banned in their state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move away from the risks inherent to
chemical nutrients, and instead invest in
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your soil again and again,
reducing costs and improving the vitality
[SPEAKER_00]: of your soil with each cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep It Simple Organics has been a leader
in aerated compost teas for years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now provide premium soils and
nutrients to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer a full line of all-natural
inputs for building your soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding microbe communities, and brewing
nutrient and compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can even help you test your soil to
spot deficiencies that may be holding you
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out their website at kisorganics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter the word SHANGO into the format
checkout to receive 10% off your first
[SPEAKER_00]: order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop pouring bottled nutrients on your
soil only to throw it out each cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start building living soil that will serve
you for years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit kisorganics.com and grow healthy,
thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well-known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_00]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum, and that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes sold by true terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are certified organic, non-GMO,
and food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they are extracted from real
plant sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no solvents of any kind used
during the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, terpenes from true terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is, other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you stack those terpenes to make
a blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes also has strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset
Sherbet, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_00]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've shopped for terps before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_00]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some alpha-pinene so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
true terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terps you want to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose true terpenes for a top-shelf
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash true
terpenes to find out more or click on the
[SPEAKER_00]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shane Golos, and our guest
this week is Shane Young, founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies Biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this last section, I want to talk
about what it's actually like to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: application process.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about applying the
beneficial insects to the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great question because the problem
that people or growers have been seeing is
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, information on the
packaging on the leader containers or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you're using for application,
you know, some of them say, spread these
[SPEAKER_01]: all over your flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, that's not what you
want to do in cannabis at this stage
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're going to be spending a lot
of time trying to clean that up if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually clean it all up, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very difficult for people to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it comes with, you know,
an initial conversation, possibly people
[SPEAKER_01]: reaching out on how do I apply this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, we try to write it
out for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to make things simple on,
you know, obviously the label is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: say this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to say you're not going to
follow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can come up in conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can come up by email, whatever it may
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give an example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get real specific there,
Shane?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of application example would you
see on the labels that you would educate
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I try to make sure that the listeners
have got, you know, real actionable
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give us an example of why cannabis is
different from the other crops that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're beneficial insect may be labeled
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just what I touched on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, one of the labels says to spread
the product over your flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be my first thought right now
is that's specifically for a thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: predator, whether you're using Swirsky or
kookamaris of species for it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they want to say to spread it
across the flower because that's generally
[SPEAKER_01]: where the thrips are going to congregate,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that you could do is I feel
that it's an old method of control,
[SPEAKER_01]: but still an effective method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is you can use it to apply to the base or
the stock of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you can create piles towards
the stem where they'll crawl up in your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: A secondary way that you can do it is is
what we call in the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them hanging baskets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's funny is I used to I used to
try to figure out a more effective way of
[SPEAKER_01]: application for product as well a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually used to buy like Dixie cups
or solo cups and I would poke holes in
[SPEAKER_01]: them and use like not wire hangers,
but like ornament hangers to hang out on
[SPEAKER_01]: my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would dump product into these cups
and then I would hang them on the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: because the active adults are going to
crawl up the plant or up the cup into your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just years ago, biocontrol
companies started creating what they call
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging baskets where they were already
pre-made for you to do an application for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's difficult is when somebody is
like, yeah, I followed the directions and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can't give that information
out, you know, on the on the application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually try to provide like an
application sheet for specific species
[SPEAKER_01]: when we work with people as well so that,
you know, when they're choosing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something again, we want them to be
effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to give them the most
information to be effective, which is how
[SPEAKER_01]: to do the application at that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really what comes to mind on my
on my side when he asked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the choice between using,
say, for example, a hanging basket or a
[SPEAKER_00]: sachet, do those different application
techniques depend on the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial that you're adding or the size
of the garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just simply the preference of the
grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually touches on a lot of different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preference of the grower, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple different ways of doing
an application.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's one thing called the
slow release sachet, which is an actual
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding bag is what I call it,
that slowly release predatory mites into
[SPEAKER_01]: the canopy of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I stress to people is these are
truly used as a preventative maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have a problem,
you want to use active adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a problem, if you have a pest
issue, you don't want to use slow release
[SPEAKER_01]: sachets on that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it will be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be helpful in the long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do the sachets and the adults
in the same application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, that gives you more immediate
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it gives you long lasting control
of the sachet that you've already applied
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different species are available in
different different forms of application.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, they come in slow
release sachets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in active adults, which at which
I call the bulk liter containers or five
[SPEAKER_01]: liter bags can be used for commercial
growers that use more product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's flyers that can just be
released that fly, you know, that can kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of encompass your growing space on their
own where you don't have to apply them to
[SPEAKER_01]: every single plant or every third plant by
any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just depends on the predator that
you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a lot of the the breeders of
these beneficial insects, they sell them
[SPEAKER_00]: with application rates that were devised
for ornamental plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is a very unique lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know, what have you seen as far as
any difference in output application rates
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis versus, you know,
boring industry standard plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's I don't say unfortunate that I
can't change my information online because
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that information direct from the
suppliers who actually culture the
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you touch on it, when I started
recommending cannabis agricultural rates,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would calculate out by square footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean is kind of what I
used to do per acre, basically calculate
[SPEAKER_01]: out in square footage what can be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just remember selling my first liter
of soil mites for fungus net control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And God, the guy had I don't know how many
plants in his, you know, a thousand square
[SPEAKER_01]: foot room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, you know, one liter of
soil mites per one thousand square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the rate I've used for
the last eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will knock the shit out of your fungus
nets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, two weeks later,
he's like, no, it's not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I got into, well,
why isn't it working?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of water that's being
applied to the plant, because not not just
[SPEAKER_01]: for the hell of it, you know, it's because
it demands it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows like a weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs that water and basically for for
growth at that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just starting from that small arena of
more soil mites more often, we had to get
[SPEAKER_01]: some in every single pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ran trials for I don't know if it was
four months or so, you know, offering
[SPEAKER_01]: products, splitting product with people
who were interested in using it on kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: formulated a plan for them moving forward
on how to be effective using this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it going to be cost effective on
our end?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but when you talk about cost
effectiveness, you take out labor of
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying, you take out the health of the
plant, basically, you take out any chance
[SPEAKER_01]: of getting knocked for a pesticide test,
all these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess looking over it and talking to
the guys in the office here that we deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with, there's very few growers that we
have that use traditional egg rates and
[SPEAKER_01]: are very effective with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very few and far between.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the most part, you can times the
rates by five just to give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: generalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also depends on what you're doing
on the back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you made the comment about hit
it or apply it and leave it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier on in the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you can't do that with
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that if you have a spray
program because you still need to monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There still may be a pest issue or a pest
presence at that stage where if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: take care of it right away, it's going to,
you know, quickly become larger and larger
[SPEAKER_01]: as you move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I hope that kind of kind of
helps answer the question that you were
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you do you find that based on bio
regions, for example, where where the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant plants are being grown in the U.S.,
that you either need to choose different
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects or the application rate
changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I assume that if you're doing
applications, you know, in the cold
[SPEAKER_00]: northwest, it's going to be a lot
different in the hella hot Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it has to do with one,
you know, choosing the correct species for
[SPEAKER_01]: the pest that you're after.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, number two, it does have to do
with the heat and also the humidity of a
[SPEAKER_01]: region where you're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of times lower humidities
are going to dry out the eggs of the
[SPEAKER_01]: predatory mites, which causes problems or
which delays reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it takes longer to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I've been approached by a
lot of people who, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: running 10, 15 percent humidity throughout
the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my comment is, no, these these are not
documented to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may need to do, again, applications
more often to be effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may switch it up rather than using
these sachets, which are probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: release slowly in your crop and not a
little bit quicker, more quickly at a
[SPEAKER_01]: place that has 50 percent humidity or 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is fairly ideal for reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just go into, again, all honesty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, hey, man, this was three years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a guy that's like, hey, your sachet
has lasted five five weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 12 percent humidity for three
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't understand how that was
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But showing them how to open the packages
up, looking to see if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduction, finding them on their plants
and what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it's nice to be able to push
the boundaries of what they're documented
[SPEAKER_01]: to do specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tell people it's not documented for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, we don't recommend to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what I would probably choose
in your specific area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's built a little bit better for the
lower humidities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's able to reproduce a little bit
quicker than another species that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we kind of go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the feedback comes in,
Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we can't just give somebody a
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: They walk away and use it and never hear
from them again, because there's always
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback that we can use from everybody
that we can help other growers with on if
[SPEAKER_01]: this didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, we had another guy that
did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very successful for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of it has to do with,
you know, again, from the very beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: is, you know, sanitation, plant health,
monitoring, scouting, being able to know
[SPEAKER_01]: what pests are what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pest identification is key that we're
using the correct species from the very
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning or we're not going to be very
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can beneficial insects be used in outdoor
crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we use it many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: All last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoors is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors, yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no problems using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the beneficial insects walk away from
the cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always figured that,
at least with an indoor program,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were, you know, they were penned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were captured inside of the
greenhouse or the building or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go outdoors, you know,
they could just walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on what you're using,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's flyers that make me
nervous on if you release them,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just going to fly away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also create attractant plants
to keep them near.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, that gives them an additional
food source if they don't find you on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that you are that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you talk about them walking away,
it becomes like an application technique
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're applying them directly
onto your plant, there's so much canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: space that these guys need to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how small they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in order to walk around a plant,
it's going to take them quite a while to
[SPEAKER_01]: do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, they're not going to
crawl down your stem and out into the dirt
[SPEAKER_01]: and go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our experience, they generally stay on
your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking for food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're predators versus the
pests that you guys have that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of the times they're slow
because all they're doing is sitting there
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding on your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus versus what we offer people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking for food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, they're going to be a little
bit faster, basically, and they need to
[SPEAKER_01]: find food in order to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to use higher application
rates outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you know, it's a general question,
but depends on the region that you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the humidity that you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it depends on plant counts as
well and what the sizes of your canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find it, you know, a six by six plants
treated differently than a one by one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more canopy space that needs
to be covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I find interesting
is that, you know, these beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and how they do what they do,
it's not new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that the horticulture
industry has been using for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you are bringing to the table is
being the, you know, being the first
[SPEAKER_00]: person in the industry to start
transitioning and learning the ins and the
[SPEAKER_00]: outs of applying what's been used in
horticulture for decades to specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a corollary to that, I have this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any new beneficial insects that
you see coming online in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there like, you know, the new one,
the new model, or does that not really
[SPEAKER_00]: happen much in the beneficial insect scene
where you've got your set of specific and
[SPEAKER_00]: generalized beneficials and all of the
novel this and innovation is happening on
[SPEAKER_00]: application and education?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, as far as I know,
and it could be false, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the things that are cultured and
supplied in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to be native to our specific
area in order for us to offer them to
[SPEAKER_01]: other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think pretty much what is here now is
what's going to be around for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are companies that offer different
species or additional species to do
[SPEAKER_01]: different things, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each company has their own,
you know, they have their own choices of
[SPEAKER_01]: what they want to culture on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when you start working with
us, again, I think, like I said in our
[SPEAKER_01]: previous conversation is that we try to
take a lot of that information out for
[SPEAKER_01]: people and just give you what we feel is
the most effective and which limits,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to make, keep it simple,
I guess you'd say with a lot of people is
[SPEAKER_01]: we try to simplify our responses towards
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think what it is is it needs
to be native in order for it to be sold
[SPEAKER_01]: and supplied here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, right here before we wrap
up, I want to give you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a platform to talk specifically to the
commercial, you know, master growers who
[SPEAKER_00]: are listening and are interested in moving
away from the synthetics or the sprays in
[SPEAKER_00]: any way and move over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they still have got concerns about,
you know, how much risk they're will be
[SPEAKER_00]: during the transition and also would they,
you know, decrease in yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, why don't you just address
that on our way out here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say to the commercial grower
who wants to go in this direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they just, they need it put in the
right terms for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, throughout our
conversation today, I've touched on a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of points for people to feel a little bit
more comfortable using this is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you touch on it about even how
beneficial insects have been cultured for
[SPEAKER_01]: decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started using them 10 years ago,
you know, I remember going to a class and
[SPEAKER_01]: there was three people in the class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next year there was 10 and
then there was 50 and then there was 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there was only standing room.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the years go on and people become
educated on what you can use them for,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really going to steer a lot
of people in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the pesticide testing is going to
steer people to use beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_01]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they need to use chemicals by any
means, they, you know, in order to make
[SPEAKER_01]: them a little bit more comfortable,
they might reach for that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what you're going to see is
higher flower content on the back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're not going to be spraying
your plants with anything, which is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to cause no stress, which allows them to
grow to their natural capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what I saw when I ran
trials 10 years ago is 30% growth increase
[SPEAKER_01]: on plants that I just use beneficial
insects for, you know, aphids,
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites, fungus nets versus a
traditional program of horticultural oils
[SPEAKER_01]: that I use on a different plant,
basically 30% increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you see, you start believing and
then you start seeking more information
[SPEAKER_01]: on, God, how can I do this even better?
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a lot of reports from a lot of
different people telling us about how
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy their plants are these days and
how much more flower they're receiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's not everybody,
but there are people that have really
[SPEAKER_01]: taken the time to do that and to seek the
information to be effective for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to push anybody to do it
if they don't want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you know, our website says choose
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested, we're more than
happy to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to give you the specific information
that you need and to help you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from day one moving forward,
because obviously we want to work with you
[SPEAKER_01]: five years down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to just talk with you one
day, give you a product that doesn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: and you be done with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if somebody doesn't order a product
for a while, we still call and follow up
[SPEAKER_01]: to see how things are going.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we do different?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is it can be time consuming for
some people to try to learn how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have somebody at your company
that's willing to grasp this and really go
[SPEAKER_01]: into and seek information and do it,
then that's going to be your best bet at
[SPEAKER_01]: this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Shane, thank you so much for being
an educator about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the show, you know, the shaping
fire show, we are very clearly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, probiotic living soil,
working with nature and not down with
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't take, you know, synthetic
input advertising money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very refreshing for me to talk
about it on this topic where we can we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get garden pests under control by working
with nature instead of trying to dominate
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate you reaching out,
Shane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice talking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being on the show, Shane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care, man.
