[SPEAKER_00]: Most people in the cannabis scene assume
they know how to judge good flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: A subset of those people also think they
have advanced enough skills to even judge
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alas, most people are using their own
subjective standards and preferences while
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that they are being objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets played out with very serious
impacts when wholesale cannabis buyers are
[SPEAKER_00]: judging who to buy from for their retail
outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But perhaps even more impactful is when
subjective preferences cloud the decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis cup judges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about some of
the finer points of judging the merits of
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis flower, how disreputable
judging is at most cannabis competitions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the certification called interpreting,
that is to cannabis, what a sommelier
[SPEAKER_00]: certification is to wine.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Max Montrose,
founder and current president of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichome Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the Trichome Institute,
Max is a key educational advisor to the
[SPEAKER_00]: government, business, and public sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He specializes in providing a certifiable
cannabis curriculum for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals and serious cannabis
enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about judging
the qualities of cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a pleasure, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right in, Max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis enthusiasts have a wide range of
reasons they deem cannabis to be good or
[SPEAKER_00]: bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some folks, it's just the amount of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they look is at the THC percentage,
and then they buy the one that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas some more experienced folks are
looking for terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But similarly, patients are most often
judging flower based on if it gives them
[SPEAKER_00]: relief or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these folks are looking at the
same cannabis in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's totally happened
because there's never really been an
[SPEAKER_00]: established standard for judging cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you, with the Trichome Institute,
built this interpreting program,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of like a, not kind of,
it is a sommelier-like certification for
[SPEAKER_00]: people interpreting the standards for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the key aspects that you've
put together for judging the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think before I want to dive into
the aspects that we put forth to judging
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower, is it fair to maybe first look
at all the different types and reasons why
[SPEAKER_01]: judging and grading cannabis is important
in our industry today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody from a patient to a
retail buyer to the grower, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody's judging for their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've probably teased out more of that
than anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know how in our industry,
everyone grows the best weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everybody does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because everybody grows the best
cannabis and because there isn't a system
[SPEAKER_01]: or a mechanism to decipher the differences
between the quality of the units,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're seeing on a wholesale market
is the price per pound for cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: should not be consumed being sold at
nearly the same price of really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really high quality product that is
extremely difficult to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is a real big problem because
the high quality producers, they deserve
[SPEAKER_01]: to get anywhere between three to maybe
even a thousand dollars more per pound,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or on the reverse, people who are growing
really low quality cannabis, stuff that's
[SPEAKER_01]: unflushed, unripe, has a bunch of
pesticides on it, what have you,
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff should not be selling for as
high as it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're the only multi-billion dollar
market in the world that has no ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: measure the difference of its quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every head of lettuce in the
grocery store and apples and even your
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, your pharmacy has all been
quality verified and checked for your
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer safety and also for your,
I guess so that it tastes good too,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just being safe, but that it's a high
quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of silly that the
cannabis industry doesn't have anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that when at the same time our
industry is more serious about bragging
[SPEAKER_01]: rights and proving that our cannabis is
better than the other persons,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is why we've developed entire
cannabis cups around this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost this black market process of
how do you prove to your purchaser that
[SPEAKER_01]: your cannabis is better than the other
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that would be really
important at the wholesale level too,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so many people are buying flour
and they are deciding whether or not to
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a bag for bag appeal or run it
into oil because it might be strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not very pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing that mostly on the opinion
of the producer unless they go and they
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look at it themselves first person,
which is super time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that a standard that got
picked up throughout the industry would be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much helpful to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also at the consumer level as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the state of Washington,
you're not allowed to see or smell the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis before you purchase it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you basically get this grab bag for 50
bucks and you're just praying that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what the TAG program is,
is trichome assurance grading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It truly is the world's first and only
cannabis quality certification process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, hold on before you go too far down
the TAG thing, I want to talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to focus on TAG more on the second
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about you at cannabis
cups, let's circle back around first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I know that you're using these
sommelier folks, these interpreters in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I first want to set up, you know,
why these interpreters, where they get
[SPEAKER_00]: their skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, let's circle back around to
like, what are you teaching interpreters
[SPEAKER_00]: as the quality aspects in flour,
which makes your, your, your interpreter,
[SPEAKER_00]: your sommelier program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, why is that the best
standard in the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, interpreting is cannabis sommelier
ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in all decadent categories of
expertise, which would include wine
[SPEAKER_01]: sommeliers, beer cicerones, cheese
mongers, coffee cuppers, tobaccoists,
[SPEAKER_01]: honeyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of what they're analyzing is
one quality and two, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how well does it pair with another food?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's about, does it taste good and
what does it pair with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And interpreting does the same thing,
but to go so much further, way far,
[SPEAKER_01]: way more important is, you know,
in the beer industry, when you order an
[SPEAKER_01]: IPA, you get an IPA, but in the cannabis
industry, you could order Blue Dream and
[SPEAKER_01]: not get Blue Dream, you know, nine out of
10 times in Colorado for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most counterfeit strain name in
our state and in Washington too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what interpreting does is in an
industry that's as young as it is with the
[SPEAKER_01]: strain name dilemma and speciation dilemma
is it empowers customers and patients to
[SPEAKER_01]: know how their cannabis will affect them
physically, mentally, psychotropically,
[SPEAKER_01]: by being able to see and smell the
psychotropic differences within the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, interpreting,
we really start out in cannabis elementary
[SPEAKER_01]: school, where we, you know, first teach
you about the very first cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: ever, pituitive, ancestral, primordial,
cannabisia, cannabis ruderalis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how that species created the indica
and sativa species and how those species
[SPEAKER_01]: moved around the planet and how some are
drug types and some are hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got both of each and this is why
it gets really confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then going further, the program
basically gets to a point where we analyze
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis is a massively hybridized
domesticated plant the way that dogs are,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in canine form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it's not a gray wolf and it's not
a coyote like the original strains or
[SPEAKER_01]: species in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go to a pet store,
you purchase a poodle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of the same in the
cannabis store.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowers are more like poodles than
they are like wolves and coyotes,
[SPEAKER_01]: indicas and sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're so far away from the land
race.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we have is we have to really
analyze cannabis in a much more
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligent way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interpreting really helps people to do
that by looking at cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hybridized spectrum that it's in from
stimulating to sedating flower types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we teach you how to use your
human senses to literally use your fifth
[SPEAKER_01]: cranial nerve, your trigeminal nerve in
your face to physically feel the detection
[SPEAKER_01]: of the vibration of the terpenes in
different parts of your face while
[SPEAKER_01]: simultaneously analyzing their specific
scent profiles so that we can gauge what
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes are available and what type of
pharmacology we know they produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the shape of the bud
structure, the cola itself, is dictated by
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant shape is dictated by the
geography.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the geography really helps us better
understand what type of psychotropic plant
[SPEAKER_01]: types these started out as.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really, we dissect in class over
a hundred flowers that we bring to class
[SPEAKER_01]: visually and with our smell, with our
sense of smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we dissect them for their total
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, the Trichome Institute,
we are a cannabis education company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe we're the only cannabis
education company that teaches people
[SPEAKER_01]: about bad weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so many grows and grows schools
or grow books and competitions and all
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always about the best of the best of
the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our theory is you don't know what good
weed is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until you really understand the
intricacies of poor quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moldy weed is one of those things like
male plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where a lot of people who are all the way
at the end who are the consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of them have never seen a male plant
because there's no reason generally for a
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant to find its way into the food
chain for cannabis getting to the end
[SPEAKER_00]: user.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, there's no reason for moldy
weed to be in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funny when, so about three years or
so we had a plant go moldy and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I just took like six seconds of
video of it and threw it on my Shango Los
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was shocked that it's like one of
the most popular videos that people watch
[SPEAKER_00]: just because so few people have seen moldy
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that your point is well-made
that, you know, when you see miraculous
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, I mean, it kind of stands out and
you know, holy crap, this looks good and
[SPEAKER_00]: it smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to, toke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when it comes to, you know,
you know, B and medium grade flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people don't, they haven't seen
C, D and F to know the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: mids and really bad stuff that you
shouldn't ingest at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, interpreting is,
it's, it's really serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that wine salmonella ship is
serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I teach you how to assess the
degree of cannabis age, I show you
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that's three months, six,
nine, 12, 15, you know, and two years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll show you the spectrum where
we'll teach you that chlorophyll in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bud begins to bleed at the base of the
cola where the stem is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can really see the degree of
age from the chlorophyll bleeding from the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of time that it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as the particular and very
specific smell old cannabis produces,
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of the strain or terpene types
that it started out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're really kind of the only place
in the world where you can get that
[SPEAKER_01]: hands-on, you know, smell on lecture
expert experience, but also with the molds
[SPEAKER_01]: and unflushed cannabis and cannabis with
nutrient lock, chemical burn, spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites, male flower sites, poor trim,
hemp that was harvested early on purpose
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep the THC levels down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we really bring all of these
cannabis samples to class in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Denver classes are level two,
which is the hands-on class that also
[SPEAKER_01]: includes a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, after the four hour
education and workshop, we give you 10
[SPEAKER_01]: jars of cannabis that are unlabeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the test is, is you have one hour
to pick five out of the 10 and tell us
[SPEAKER_01]: what's wrong with those herbs,
identify the species of mold or the degree
[SPEAKER_01]: of the unflush or what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other five line them up in
order from stimulating to sedating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's five of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when people can do this,
when people pass more than 80 percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: their level two tests, they become a level
two certified interpreter and they get a
[SPEAKER_01]: green pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have level two certified
interpreters in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have flown in and have passed from
South Africa, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every class we teach, we have people fly
in from more than five different states
[SPEAKER_01]: and multiple countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last class, we had people fly in from even
the Czech Republic and in Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know your classes are jam packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that one of the aspects of it
is that it really is a pilgrimage,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I've been wanting to take
your interpreting series myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but being out here on Vashon Island where
I live, I'm a long way away from Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I need to make a
specific plan to come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, you know, even though your
class would blow up if you did it online,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's simply no way to do it because the
experience of grading cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to do it in person because so
much of it is based on smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, I mean, so yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the yes is yes to everything that you
just said because it makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the Denver class and it is a
pilgrimage because people do have to come
[SPEAKER_01]: to us because we can't take 100 flowers
across any border.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so unfortunately, it's a pilgrimage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the no part is the level one that we
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And level one is simply people who are
just so excited to learn about
[SPEAKER_01]: interpreting and they want the three hour
lecture and the ability to interact with
[SPEAKER_01]: me in person and ask all the questions
that they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do do these level one courses at a state
and I just did one at Dope magazine's
[SPEAKER_01]: headquarters in Seattle while I was out
there judging the Dope Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a full class for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and because I was judging the cup,
I had enough cannabis to actually detect
[SPEAKER_01]: the enough that were different to
demonstrate and show in class.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some actually poor quality ones as well as
the spectrum in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of like a level one and a
half, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will tell you that, you know,
our interpreting tools are super fun and
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're colorful and interactive and
simple to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the guidebook, I've actually started
looking at the idea of scratch and sniff
[SPEAKER_01]: stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there were people in Australia or
the UK who it would just be a little too
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme to make the pilgrimage that maybe
we could in the interpreting, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: super kit actually put vials of live
terpenes that will go along with the
[SPEAKER_01]: guidebook with scratch and sniff stickers
so that we can, you know, if I tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: that the smell of unflushed flour smells
like this and you scratch it and it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than, I guess, not having a
scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a scratch and sniff cannabis
sommelier book would just be the coolest
[SPEAKER_01]: thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you find that there's a lot of
variability in the terpenes that different
[SPEAKER_00]: people's noses can pick up, just like with
wine, different people's palates can pick
[SPEAKER_00]: up different notes?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am I'm unfortunately too busy to do
so many things in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that I need to get around it
doing is testing myself as a super taster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've ordered my kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do have the super taster tester kit,
which is really fun to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently there's this this chemical
way to analyze if you are a part of a
[SPEAKER_01]: small population of humans on earth who
have an ability to taste things much
[SPEAKER_01]: greater than other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do have lots of people tell me that
one reason why they're concerned that they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to come to class is because
they have a really poor sense of smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I just ask them,
how much do you care about passing your
[SPEAKER_01]: test versus learning all of the
information about what cannabis is,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it comes from, how it works and how
to identify its qualitative features.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's better than you being able to
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So class is still important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the most interesting thing the
thing that's the craziest part of
[SPEAKER_01]: interpreting and the thing that needs more
science and more research is where you
[SPEAKER_01]: feel the smell in the different parts of
your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I still have never seen anybody in
the world publish any type of media or
[SPEAKER_01]: content or literature or video or anything
around the idea that this is something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is true and happens and is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been doing this since I was a
young kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I teach this to people and it is
extremely accurate that stimulating
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene types are felt on the alphalmic
part of the trigeminal nerve, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the nose in between your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas sedating and heavier physically
heavier live hydrocarbon chains,
[SPEAKER_01]: isomers, terpenes, deeper, richer,
rounder, more robust, chocolates,
[SPEAKER_01]: leathers, tobaccos that sit in the lower
part of your nostril and is felt there are
[SPEAKER_01]: really sedative dominant variety types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's this totally crazy thing
because whether it's cannabis or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: 99% of everybody I show this to says I've
never in my life even known that my nose
[SPEAKER_01]: could smell at different parts of my nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've never even realized that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you come to class,
not only do you see the qualitative
[SPEAKER_01]: features, the botanical elements of the
flower that are consistent with their
[SPEAKER_01]: quote unquote sativa indica, in reality
it's more like narrow leaf drug types that
[SPEAKER_01]: are stimulating versus broad leaf drug
types that are sedating do have these
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent correlations within them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where things get complex is the fact
that these are all hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a ton of crossover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is unbelievably particular and
minuscule and just what we're analyzing is
[SPEAKER_01]: the most subtle of visual differences,
smell differences and taste differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extremely, extremely subtle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, some people are much better at
seeing and smelling these subtle features
[SPEAKER_01]: than most other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we get back from the first
commercial break, we are going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about how you and your team of
interpreters are kind of remaking the
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive nature of cannabis cups by
bringing your mad skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Max Montrose, founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Trichome Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anyone who is paying attention to
cannabis medicine, it has become
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly apparent that full extract
cannabis oil, known to some as Rick
[SPEAKER_00]: Simpson oil, is the cornerstone of healing
humans with medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you own a medical dispensary or retail
store, you know that your customers are
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for it every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have been working with patients
and seeking out quality full extract oil
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Pacific Northwest, you know the
provider Deep Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kat Jeter and her team at Deep Green have
been making full extract cannabis oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: setting the standards for quality and
exact dosing for years in Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Deep Green brand is known by patients
and cannabis media as a premium quality
[SPEAKER_00]: provider for sick children, cancer
patients and others in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a time when there are no national
standards for cannabis oil, ensuring a
[SPEAKER_00]: product is whole plant, quality assured
and lab tested is often a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing your source is reputable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust in a quality brand is essential in
choosing a cannabis medicine that is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be used concentrated and in volume by
any patient and especially those with
[SPEAKER_00]: weakened immune systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep Green is looking for national brand
partners to expand the availability of
[SPEAKER_00]: their legacy top shelf cannabis oil to
emerging medical and licensed states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partners benefit from the Deep Green brand
recognition and credibility as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: ongoing customer and marketing support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but Deep Green knows how to
employ the 280E tax rule so you can deduct
[SPEAKER_00]: it all from your taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with Deep Green can provide the
trust and authenticity too often pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: aside in favor of lifestyle products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your customers can assure themselves that
regardless of the state in which it is
[SPEAKER_00]: made, brand licensees adhere to the same
strict standards that patients everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: have come to expect from Deep Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep Green licensing includes startup and
capital planning as well as operations and
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing instruction as you'd expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information on how your company,
co-op or medical dispensary can benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from partnering with Deep Green to provide

[SPEAKER_00]: That's shapingfire.com forward slash Deep
Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Max Montrose, founder and
[SPEAKER_00]: president of the Trichome Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we were talking about
what interpreting is and what all the
[SPEAKER_00]: variable quality data points are when
truly looking at cannabis flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: judging its quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the second set, we're going to
talk about very specifically how these
[SPEAKER_00]: skills are being cross applied to judging
cannabis costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, cannabis cups have been
ridiculed since the very beginning for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everything from taking bribes to
influence results or simply giving awards
[SPEAKER_00]: to their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty much ruined the reputation
of most competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In response to that, you have begun
teaching cup event promoters in
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative judging methods that are based
much more on botany and data points
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of just the judge's personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this system better than traditional
cannabis cups?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about, I guess, cannabis cups
when describing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you put in a product in a
traditional, let's just say, cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're really expensive and the
competition is serious and the reward is
[SPEAKER_01]: really meaningful because in this
industry, being able to prove that your
[SPEAKER_01]: product is better than the next guy's is
your best method of marketing in
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising, specifically in this industry
and in many others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these judges and their judgments
are making or breaking multi-million
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people who deserve to win these
things it's important to celebrate their
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard efforts because it takes more
than a decade to have the types of skills
[SPEAKER_01]: to win cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people are, if the way that we're
judging them isn't accurate in ensuring
[SPEAKER_01]: that those who deserve to win win,
then we're celebrating people who we
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't be and promoting more poor
quality products and cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this is really important stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you're starting out with is
who are these judges?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are their qualifications for
judging?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not gonna name any names,
but I'll just say the largest and probably
[SPEAKER_01]: oldest cannabis magazine that we're all
familiar with, you can actually pay to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a judge, a thousand bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your parents have enough money and
you want to prove to your friends that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're super cool, we now have people who
don't even know what trichomes are,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even know what a calyx is,
who think that the male anther is called a
[SPEAKER_01]: banana on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the people who are now gonna
determine whether your business deserves
[SPEAKER_01]: to be rewarded or not and put in the
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and if it's not those people,
then it's really qualified industry
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you ask what does really
qualified mean, it means they've grown
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis a few times and they've smoked it
for five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, do you study technical
textbooks on cannabis and all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: intricacies?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you find is that most people just
aren't as dorky and nerdy as people who
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of work at the Trichome Institute and
who put together a lot of these data
[SPEAKER_01]: points in these textbooks that we produce
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we've done is in terms of
starting out with who the judges are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to be a really qualified judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to be an interpreter level
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to be able to dissect and
analyze cannabis quality and its
[SPEAKER_01]: psychotropic spectrum in less than five
minutes, whereas the level two test,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the same test, is an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to demonstrate that in
multiple ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also have to learn the standard
operating procedure of our grading scale
[SPEAKER_01]: for concentrates and also things like
trichome ripeness, trichome density,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then learning the subtle spectrum that
really takes a in-person teacher to teach
[SPEAKER_01]: you what the degree of pungency is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something you can't learn online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to spend critical time with
someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've spent hours and hours and hours
doing this with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so literally at the Dope Cup,
when there was four, sometimes five,
[SPEAKER_01]: six of us, interpreting, utilizing the TAG
program to do these judgments,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just, it's unbelievable how much time
it takes us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're up to two or three in the morning
doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the amount of hours that we've put in
checking each other's work and
[SPEAKER_01]: cross-comparing our evaluations to make
sure that they fall within our parameters
[SPEAKER_01]: of inter-rater reliability is intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the data points that you
as interpreters are looking at versus what
[SPEAKER_00]: a normal judge would?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've obviously established that a
sommelier level interpreter of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: has got more experience and has studied it
more than the average cannabis judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also believe that your system is
going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've seen some judging packets and
some of the judging packets where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the ratings, they seem pretty fluffy
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you approach this from
such a scientific and botanical background
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would think that some of the data
points that you are looking at are
[SPEAKER_00]: different than traditional judging.
[SPEAKER_00]: What might a couple of those be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Super good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those who don't know TAG,
it's a computer program that we built and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a calculator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it's doing is it's calculating
numeric values that level three
[SPEAKER_01]: interpreters are giving to a variety of
different visual olfactory and consumption
[SPEAKER_01]: data points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in most traditional cups,
everything is subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's whatever that person thinks they
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually they're liking it intoxicated,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this program, everything is
analyzed in the exact same way double
[SPEAKER_01]: blind twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess some of the biggest
differences of our data points is we do
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire grading and calculation sober
until we're done producing all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: report cards and then it comes the
consumption aspect of the judging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're judging all of your products.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90, 95% of the judging is done sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the biggest differences
between the way that we judge in other
[SPEAKER_01]: cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we smoke cannabis, we get down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not just nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can puff tough and we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to be able to judge the
consumption because it's unbelievable how
[SPEAKER_01]: tricky cannabis can look.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can look gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can look and actually have ripe erect
trichomes that have really pungent
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and everything about that flower
just looks sexy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take a hit and you're just
coughing your brains out and your chest
[SPEAKER_01]: feels like hot spider webs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because this person didn't flush
the bud at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of the nutrients and chemicals
of the six months going into this plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it looks ripe because it is and it
smells good probably because it's in a
[SPEAKER_01]: defensive mode because it's so sick
internally and you can't really see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we're like judging the degree
of the flush, it's kind of like how wine
[SPEAKER_01]: sommeliers take a sip of wine and spit it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it the Clinton.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only time anybody would ever ingest
cannabis and not inhale is Bill Clinton.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes there's a Clintoning
aspect, especially when we're judging
[SPEAKER_01]: dozens and dozens and dozens of
concentrates and flowers that we can look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the report and mathematically we know
they're not gonna win versus the other
[SPEAKER_01]: huge lumps and groups where, okay,
these 25 to 30 people, one of these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: is gonna win.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll definitely bring that entire hit
into our lungs and feel the entirety of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down our throat, the intensity of the
heat, how much it makes our glands swell,
[SPEAKER_01]: the degree of the salt on the side of our
mouth, how thick is my saliva.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at the ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really analyze every piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, double blind twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's probably the other biggest
part of the difference between the way we
[SPEAKER_01]: judge and other people is we utilize a
system that transfers the subjective into
[SPEAKER_01]: the objective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the system is inter-rater reliability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially what that means is,
I keep saying double blind twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, Dope Magazine gives us all of the
samples without any strain name or a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: or dispensary operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we literally just get a bag with a
number on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not allowed to have any bias.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know the species or the
strain name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we do our grading and we go
through our process, the grades,
[SPEAKER_01]: the reports are then matched against each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're matched to other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those grades have to be within three
points of each other out of 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna tell you
this really incredible thing that happened
[SPEAKER_01]: at the cup that we didn't expect to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually there was a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tell you some funny stories too
about some of the cannabis we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had no idea that five different cup
entries from these companies took their
[SPEAKER_01]: best flower and divided it into two
different categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was the same flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody told us this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're not allowed to know
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, double blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so outside of our cannabis quality
certification, there's a lab that does the
[SPEAKER_01]: lab analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something we should also talk
about is why the TAG process actually does
[SPEAKER_01]: do a quality analysis over all mandated
lab processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all medical states and retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is this lab did the
chemotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cannabinoid terpene analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reports were identical for the
five flowers that were divided in two
[SPEAKER_01]: categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a total of 10 buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we learned that this happened,
we were all like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is gonna be the ultimate test.
[SPEAKER_01]: How well did we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially the analogy for this is
looking at a splatter painting and asking
[SPEAKER_01]: two people to guess the number between one
and 100 that they feel this painting
[SPEAKER_01]: deserves from a quality perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it an 87?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a 64?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking two people and we're looking
at a piece of cannabis under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like a splatter painting,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And all five samples that were divided
twice, we got within our three points of
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see that also says a lot about how you
are training these interpreters,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we need to have the human element
because we want to truly be able to judge
[SPEAKER_00]: the different terpenes and how they blend
and how they impact a human.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we want to make sure
that everybody is judging using the same
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the fact that you've got these
different samples and different
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreters, and yet they're still coming
within 3% of each other, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, hey, I've got one more question I
want to ask you before we go to break
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're bringing in this whole new way
of judging cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gonna push out people paying to
be judges, which is an income stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gonna push out friends of the
promoter who got to be a judge because
[SPEAKER_00]: they owe to favor or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this will really remake the cup
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what degree have you had acceptance by
A, promoters, and B, people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: competing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I bet you that there's people on
both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me, it's not an easy thing to
explain to someone that they're gonna pay
[SPEAKER_01]: you to grade their weed and then tell the
world, what you found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we don't tell the world what we
find, we keep everything coded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we do find bad product, we don't
publish that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're never gonna put anybody down,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a good thing to start
with the tag program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really, in terms of the revenue
stream for the companies that have paid
[SPEAKER_01]: judges, tell you what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of making money off of ensuring
that your cup is gonna be completely
[SPEAKER_01]: inaccurate and probably pissing off all of
the people who are paying you to have
[SPEAKER_01]: their samples judged in the first place
and giving your cup legitimacy,
[SPEAKER_01]: why don't you do education and training
programs associated with your cup to teach
[SPEAKER_01]: the public and the consumers and other
growers what cannabis really is,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it comes from, how it helps people,
and develop a revenue stream based off of
[SPEAKER_01]: producing more education for the people
who are going to these cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Max, I mean, I get this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I are both cannabis nerds,
and I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, the heart of the question,
though, is are promoters digging this or
[SPEAKER_00]: not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's really where I wanna take
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going, hell yeah, I wanna do
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are people pushing back and saying,
I don't want your science, this is working
[SPEAKER_00]: out good for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, so here's what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing that the majority of cannabis
producers don't produce that high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are fewer producers that produce
high quality products, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, by default, there are a majority of
people who would probably prefer a system
[SPEAKER_01]: that was less accurate, because they might
have higher chances of winning,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, people who really
care about the industry and who get what
[SPEAKER_01]: the TAG program can bring to cannabis,
really, really love it, and truly respect
[SPEAKER_01]: it, and really embrace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, when I was in Oregon,
and I judged the Dope Cup in October,
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of growers who came up to me
just pissed as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, who do you think you are,
grading our weed, judging our weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not even from our state,
you don't know anything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just sat down, and I just said,
look, I'm gonna explain to you how I do
[SPEAKER_01]: this before you start hating on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I just explained to them how it
works, they all just flipped the switch
[SPEAKER_01]: instantly and said, thank you for doing
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what our industry is needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, where have you been the whole
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm really good friends with these
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, Dope Magazine has
embraced it more than any other company so
[SPEAKER_01]: far, but other companies who do cannabis
competitions have started, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: asking us about the program, but,
you know, they kind of run their
[SPEAKER_01]: competitions in their own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that a lot of producers and
promoters really appreciate the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a real competition, and that it's
possible, and people who deserve to win
[SPEAKER_01]: are winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it's fair, and that it's even.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you lose, at least it wasn't
because, you know, some stoner who didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know what they were doing about graded
your cannabis, and you lost because of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least, you know, you can go back and
analyze your report and compare it to
[SPEAKER_01]: other people's and learn why you didn't
win, and improve yourself from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, it creates a paper trail so
that people aren't feeling like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: losing because there was a, you know,
special donation made behind the scenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which cannabis cups are constantly being
charged with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, we're gonna go to our second
break and read right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is Max Montrose,
[SPEAKER_00]: founder of the TRICOM Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses everywhere are constantly
striving to reach out to people through
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know, though, that trying to reach
a cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_00]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain your service or product
and what sets it apart as desirable and
[SPEAKER_00]: help our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the podcast is young but growing
at an exceptionally fast rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, you are going to pay a
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction of the cost we'll be asking for
in just a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet everyone listening both now and to
the back catalog of interviews later will
[SPEAKER_00]: hear about your company again and again
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_00]: listening audience we will have forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today

[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shangalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our guest this week is Max Montrose,
founder and president of the Tri-Comb
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we wrap up here, Max,
you know, you've alluded a couple of times
[SPEAKER_00]: to these unexpected stories that you have
come across while grading cannabis at
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, most probably everybody
who's listening has either been interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in, attended, or wish they attended a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you, like, kind of bring a
lot of this science home for us and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: us a couple of these outlooks liar funny
stories that you've been alluding to to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of make us feel like we've been
sitting in your seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we just got back from the
Seattle Dope Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the edible category,
it's an interesting one to judge and we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have too much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to go into how we get
into the technicalities of judging that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really unbelievable how delicious
and awesome the amount of edible products
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just mind blowing how just fantastic
almost all of them are up until a point
[SPEAKER_01]: where you get, you know, some companies
who I'm not going to mention the type of
[SPEAKER_01]: drink, but I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were literally spitting some of the
stuff out in the sink left and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as judges trying to get each other to
like drink it as a joke and just it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of those just wild cards
that that pop in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more more than the drink in all of
those drinks from that company was one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these flowers that was entered in the THC
category, which is generally judged for
[SPEAKER_01]: the highest THC, but not always because
we're judging quality and THC doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: equate to quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we come across this bud and we have
we were we've literally been we've never
[SPEAKER_01]: been so astonished by a piece of flower in
our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the report, which we're going to
publish on our website soon, it literally
[SPEAKER_01]: says this is the worst piece of cannabis
we've ever seen ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it smells like a glade plug in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like just raw chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brown and it disintegrates into dust
in your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at the trichomes under
the microscope, they're like really are
[SPEAKER_01]: none.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are looks like bugs and fecal
matter as well as a lot of these black
[SPEAKER_01]: weird things we can't identify and dust
particles and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was it was literally like I
can't even describe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no analogy for how what what this
thing was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really interesting because when
you get the HPLC report from the lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a flower that has 47 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty seven percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty seven percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leaves me skeptical, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold your horses, Shane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look around at each other and we're
just like, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how is this possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, seriously, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked to the lab and they just
said they're like, look, obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody soaked this flower in hash oil
and whatever chemically hash oil that was
[SPEAKER_01]: more viscous than not has to be more like
water, probably had some chemical on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is why it smells like a glade plug
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we're looking at this thing
and that that is what they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they they thought that they were going
to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: First place for the highest THC because
essentially they cheated by soaking a
[SPEAKER_01]: flower in THC oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the next level compared to
people who would roll their flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep, you know, before submitting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then tried to hide that they did this
because like it wasn't like sticky hash
[SPEAKER_01]: oil on the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't see the oil, just the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the flower was like tan and brown and
smelled horrible and disintegrated,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, long story short, we were just
like, you think you're going to win first
[SPEAKER_01]: place?
[SPEAKER_01]: Enihilated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said, you know, we just don't
appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you don't sell this like to the
public.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope this isn't really a product that
you make and that this is more of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: joke in your attempts to try to win a
cannabis cup, because at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, it's not funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was some of the most disgusting
shit we've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was offensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll tell you, but on a good note to
end on a positive note, because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: aggregating data in the way that we are,
we have an opportunity where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: literally analyzing the collectiveness of
what makes Oregon cannabis, Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, what makes Colorado cannabis,
Colorado cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are different, almost like
countrywide Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then within those there are Tewa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this really is an interpreting
someone yay analysis, but at a state
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were just completely blown away,
fascinated and also quickly bored by the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that 98% of every flower we smelled
in the competition smelled like a diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one, every single one was Gorilla
Glue number four or sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are really high in terpenaline,
a gas like smell that produces a really
[SPEAKER_01]: racy kind of high effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuels are really popular around here,
especially since we have a hard time
[SPEAKER_00]: getting them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of the Northwest is
Indica's, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so the thing is, is I was talking
with a gentleman who works in the area and
[SPEAKER_01]: what he said was really intelligent,
which was a lot of the diesel varietals
[SPEAKER_01]: for whatever reason have been known to
resist mold better than other strengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because Seattle and in that area is
just covered in water and rain and wetness
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time, that there's really a
majority of a type of strain that has a
[SPEAKER_01]: better chance of surviving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happens to be these high
terpenaline diesel like varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the geography and the requirement
to have mold resistant strains in that
[SPEAKER_01]: geography is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's the case, that's what we
analyzed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at over 200 flower samples,
literally 98% of them smelled almost
[SPEAKER_01]: identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all just different little subtle
versions of diesel, diesel, diesel,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it got bored quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that really is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had not considered that because,
you know, a lot of times we don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa around here just simply because if
they're grown indoor, people don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend the extra light hours to finish the
sativa and good luck finishing a sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor anywhere here in the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that makes sense, because if they've
got if they're naturally resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: mold, people will certainly keep the
lights on longer for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know that you could probably do an
entire show just on the same topic again,
[SPEAKER_00]: but our time is up for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have you back another time
in a few weeks, though, to talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: very interesting stories that you've got
to share about beating cannabis DUIs and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you're being flown around the country
to be an expert witness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I look forward to having you back
again soon, Max.
