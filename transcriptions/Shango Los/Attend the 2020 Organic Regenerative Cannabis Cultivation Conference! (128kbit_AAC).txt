[SPEAKER_02]: Hey there so we are here today to talk
about the regenerative Cannabis growing
[SPEAKER_02]: conference that that first toured the last
two years, but now is back for a third
[SPEAKER_02]: year I'm here with the designers and
creators of it Joshua Rutherford and
[SPEAKER_02]: Leighton Morrison and And guys I wanted to
have you on the channel so that we could
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about why people should go to the
conference because I'm a big fan I missed
[SPEAKER_02]: the first year, but but last year I was
able to check it out and And it's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: gathering of the tribe for regenerative
cannabis people so so Joshua Why don't you
[SPEAKER_02]: go first and and kind of describe the
conference and why it matters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean the goal with the conference
really was is to get people into the you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the science of organic regenerative
cannabis cultivation and to dig into the
[SPEAKER_00]: details because I found that through
online and different teachings different
[SPEAKER_00]: people were missing different parts and
that bringing together the different
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers and the different Thought minds
and these different angles they would
[SPEAKER_00]: bring a more clear whole picture That was
kind of the real main driver and still is
[SPEAKER_00]: the main driver But we've kind of had this
secondary mission that's popped up and and
[SPEAKER_00]: you nailed it right on the head of
gathering of the tribe and For whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: reason the timing was right when everyone
was transitioning You know into
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization that that we needed a place
where we could come together and like
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out How are we going to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that has kind of crept into part of
the conference is is a coming together and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Josh and Kelly the Dem Collective
has been a big part of that and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really excited to see where that
goes in the future and So it's really kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of been a supporting, you know supporting
the community and and holy hell like being
[SPEAKER_00]: in Humboldt last year I mean all the
places but to meet people that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: growing weed for 10 years 20 years 30
years and in doing the struggle all on
[SPEAKER_00]: their own it's just like your instant
brothers and sisters like hugs and like
[SPEAKER_00]: man we're Instagramming about the rain
this year and it's just a camaraderie It's
[SPEAKER_00]: been really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year I was at Michigan and I've
had the same experience where people I met
[SPEAKER_02]: in Michigan You know, they've got their
unique community of people and now you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I'm texting back and forth to them
and some of those folks went out the
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt and now they've got new allies in
Humboldt and So so you already mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh and Kelly from dragonfly earth
medicine who are you know, we're all fans
[SPEAKER_02]: of But the the list of educators for the
event is as incredible as it is It's been
[SPEAKER_02]: the last two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Would you just name drop a bunch of
people who are on the flyer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Elaine Ingham, of course, she's the
the guru Layton Morrison, obviously my
[SPEAKER_00]: partner in it and he brings a whole
interesting level Chris Trump We're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have Suzanne Wainwright Evans The bug lady
the bug lady chip Osborne, which she
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't join us last year But he brings a
whole part of soil chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like super heady petty and super
critical It's we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real Part that's missing in the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're gonna have dr. Efron out
there and talk about myocrysid fungi And
[SPEAKER_00]: then of course uncle Kev Kevin Jodhury,
you know Stoked to have him back and and
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're really turning Sunday into a
genetic day into a Kevin Jodhury day to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about Genetics and to do a seed swap,
which has become a huge part of this It
[SPEAKER_00]: was amazing last year to see breeders who
are selling $300 $500 packs, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: giving and trading seeds openly among
People, you know, and it didn't have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were there was vegetable seeds being
traded for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so beautiful and It's it's how
we're gonna survive and it's how we're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna a few phylos So so so so so far
you're you're picking up that it's a it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a real community event It's really down to
earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got like dream team of speakers
gonna be there But you know when I first
[SPEAKER_02]: started posting that tickets were Already
on sale people are like, oh I went last
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to go this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like no Not not only do most of the
speakers will will speak for an hour
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes more especially two hours right
on even if they're speaking for two hours
[SPEAKER_02]: most of these speakers could do whole days
on their own and the speakers know that
[SPEAKER_02]: they need to provide new and different
content than last year and so So so
[SPEAKER_02]: Layton, I know that you know like You were
very clear that these speakers are the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of the industry So why would we swap them
out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you tell us a little bit about
about why people who were there last year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should make sure that they're here again
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's just so much new information
out there You know the the deeper
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of these what I'm gonna call
communities now of organisms Not just
[SPEAKER_01]: three four bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's a whole community of these
guys that are working together and There's
[SPEAKER_01]: some new information on F to B ratios,
which is fungus the bacteria That's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of Brazil that Elaine learned over the
summer So each one of these speakers every
[SPEAKER_01]: year ups their game and brings new
information to the table So yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna be touching on the basics and
making sure that the newbies have some
[SPEAKER_01]: point to start But we're gonna be diving
deeper into the present information that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've learned over the last year and these
relationships between the speakers I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: that that was like an amazing thing to Put
Chris Trump and Elaine on the same stage
[SPEAKER_01]: together and then like Friday nights We
all the speaker's president get up there
[SPEAKER_01]: and duke it out because we all don't
believe in everything But then again you
[SPEAKER_01]: start to open your mind saying well,
I understand what you're saying Did you
[SPEAKER_01]: ever look at it this way?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's there's a whole Symbiosis
that it's occurring right in front of you
[SPEAKER_00]: as real time Well and just to add on that
I mean it really wasn't till our last
[SPEAKER_00]: conference in Maine that the team of
speakers really started to feel like a
[SPEAKER_00]: team And and and break down some of those
social nor and get some social norms and
[SPEAKER_00]: break down some that stuff for people or
some barriers and really get into some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and like It's just been very
powerful to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is organic so so so what we're
saying here is that it may have taken all
[SPEAKER_02]: of last year for everybody to get to know
each other and my favorite parts are when
[SPEAKER_02]: one speaker from the back of the room like
Wendy Kornberg who's like constantly
[SPEAKER_02]: interrupting people are like but what
About this right and then they go huh and
[SPEAKER_02]: so you've got these active conversations
between the different educators Happening
[SPEAKER_02]: in real time in front of you And you know
what if you have something to add you can
[SPEAKER_02]: raise your hand and add it to Like where
the hell else we're gonna get this I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know of anywhere else and that's why you
guys pretty much did it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, we wanted to prevent the
misinformation that's been going around
[SPEAKER_01]: And clean up some of these details so that
people really do have a solid base
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation to work from which is why the
Name science is in the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and stay away from sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a big part, you know,
we don't have sponsors We we're paying the
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers the ticket sales pay the speakers
to be there and we've asked them to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there for Two days one to two days,
you know, they speak for two hours some
[SPEAKER_00]: speak for a little bit more But they're
there to interact with everybody and that
[SPEAKER_00]: was really the goal is it was to push us
all as a community and It's happened,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know build the community so that
people know that other people are
[SPEAKER_01]: struggling just like them and then they
can rely on each other to work together To
[SPEAKER_01]: get through this because it is it's trying
times really is and when we first talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about bringing folks back We I was really
reticent to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking we needed to bring in some
some different topics But as we as late
[SPEAKER_00]: and I dialogue that it was really There
just became very apparent that that was it
[SPEAKER_00]: was 2.0 And we just tried to need to try
to make that clear to everybody that
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you know, Suzanne has been busting
her ass She's going to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's working a ton with cannabis,
you know, it's it's really impressive to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what The learning that's going on and
even if there's going to be different
[SPEAKER_02]: topics this year than there were last year
It doesn't mean that you don't go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: same Speaker on a different topic,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all people who have got like a
wide range of knowledge It's not like they
[SPEAKER_02]: only know two hours worth of stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like Jodhuri alone, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jodhuri can speak all two days And and and
and keep the time full of interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: anecdotes So alright, so so Joshua for for
people Who don't know the reputation
[SPEAKER_02]: already like we all do about the
regenerative cannabis traveling?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know circus of Road show that's
much nicer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like Who is this for who like like if
you're if you're watching this and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like like, okay You know, we want to go to
something like this, but I don't know if
[SPEAKER_02]: this is for me Who are the people who need
to make sure that they're here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's really for cultivators 100%
you know others begin Beginners are
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome, but it's really for advanced
cultivators who are deep down the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: hole and have been doing it for a minute
to up their game, you know And one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest feedbacks and most impactful
feedbacks that both of us got was was so
[SPEAKER_00]: many hugs and so many thank yous and I'm
thinking, you know, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, you know, like thank you for
coming and making this happen and people
[SPEAKER_00]: were just so thankful to be a part of just
what we're talking about the community
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect and the Sharpening of steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the what's the same polishing
honing of steel or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: But Yeah, I mean and again the they're
missing little pieces and they don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what those pieces are But then they start
to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh god now I get it That's why this year I
kicked it out of the park and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: year after I failed was because I missed
this piece So it's it's really sharpening
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody on many levels and then they
also can get together With the speakers
[SPEAKER_01]: and talk about their specific needs which
I think is really really valuable for
[SPEAKER_02]: these cultivators and it's cool too
because there's not like vendor booths and
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsorships here and so on the breaks,
you know, you can step outside and share a
[SPEAKER_02]: toke with like these these educators and
and talk to them and ask them your
[SPEAKER_02]: questions and it's not like oh they spoke
and then they got to run to the airport
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're gone they're actually there
for a day or two Because there aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsors paying for it your ticket price
is paying for it And so they're there for
[SPEAKER_02]: you, which I thought was really cool You
know, I don't want to say who I smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: joints with but it's nice that you can go
out with these brakes on the brakes and
[SPEAKER_02]: share Share a joint with like one of your
heroes like how bad ass is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so so so let's talk about tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tickets are already on sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to go Do not waste your
time and getting a ticket but also It's
[SPEAKER_02]: different this year because the tickets
were available at the door last year None
[SPEAKER_02]: of that this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would made for a total pain in the ass,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in the it's early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's half asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was up all night like exchanging
information about regenerative cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: none of that So so this year it's gonna be
a limited number of tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all available in advance which
means we're almost certainly going to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: out and so so Joshua if people Want to get
hooked up with a ticket in their city?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is easiest regenerative
organic cannabis comm click on the city
[SPEAKER_00]: And scroll down to the bottom purchase
tickets will take you to eventbrite right
[SPEAKER_02]: on so pretty straightforward So so it's
easy to buy tickets you go to the website
[SPEAKER_02]: and the link is in the in the description
below Order online if you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the money today take credit
cards and and also You know don't be in
[SPEAKER_02]: the position Where you put it off and put
it off and put it off until all the
[SPEAKER_02]: tickets are sold out that happened You
know to lots of people well not at the
[SPEAKER_02]: event But I'm thinking of like concerts
that I got skunked out at right I put off
[SPEAKER_02]: the stuff forever and ever until I can't
get like a ticket and then I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, well, I guess I'm not going don't be
that person right there the value of
[SPEAKER_02]: coming together as a Community and sharing
this information and the fact that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: not alone growing right the idea that
There are other organic cultivators out
[SPEAKER_02]: there who really care about microbe life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is a pretty big deal So so $350
will change your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it will change your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told that a lot It's it's been
really cool, and I'll take the credit to
[SPEAKER_00]: us I just take the credit to the community
and coming together one thing I did want
[SPEAKER_00]: to add that I think is pretty pretty vital
is we are adding Breeder booths this year
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna you know probably four or
five and we haven't released the names
[SPEAKER_00]: except for we got Kaya Pacific Northwest
Roots He's gonna be with us and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have some more guys They'll there be
there all weekend to talk with you and
[SPEAKER_00]: also sell their gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, and there I don't think we've
mentioned the seed swap either and so Why
[SPEAKER_02]: don't you tell us about Friday night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Well, we do the seed will stop on
Sunday at lunch and it's an open seed swap
[SPEAKER_00]: bring what you got bring what you made and
it's actually been a really cool literal
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-pollination where you know some guys
from I don't want to start calling it who
[SPEAKER_00]: and why you know because people are moving
these these genetics in an Out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But it's it's because you know,
I'm looking for something You know with
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome me and we were talking about that
earlier and who has it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh this guy over here has that go link
down him and and then now it's being grown
[SPEAKER_00]: in Maine over here up in Canada and it's
it's really cool and we're helping each
[SPEAKER_00]: other grow better by Helping each other
get better genetics right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really awesome And so since I thought
that the seed swap was on Friday,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's actually on Sunday Friday night
is special to tell us a little bit Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: night Friday night we have all the
speakers throw down so We bring all the
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers in and we put them up on the
stage and I kind of fo host it but really
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a live Q&A and we Let the audience
ask questions and it it creates awkward
[SPEAKER_00]: moments sometimes when when when different
members of the speakers disagree But it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good we give a beer and stuff and
get them loosened up a little bit and It's
[SPEAKER_00]: been really awesome and powerful and and
and just fun for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so if you are into regenerative
cannabis, this is not something you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to miss and the guys have set their
schedule from the West Coast all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: across to the East Coast and also hitting
in in Canada once in Vancouver and so,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know last year people in those cities
were certainly there but people flew in
[SPEAKER_02]: and road tripped and put together their
posse and all came like like this is You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, this is the kind of thing that's
worth traveling to so, you know Don't be
[SPEAKER_02]: don't be left outside hearing about how
great it is It was so again the link to
[SPEAKER_02]: get tickets is in the description Don't
miss it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you care about regenerative cannabis
like come meet up with more family And no
[SPEAKER_01]: two shows of the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, they're all different There's
different speakers at each one right and
[SPEAKER_01]: also there's feedback is different The
whole vibe is different these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean you can do it all forward
You're gonna still learn something new
[SPEAKER_01]: each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Thank you so much to everyone that's
