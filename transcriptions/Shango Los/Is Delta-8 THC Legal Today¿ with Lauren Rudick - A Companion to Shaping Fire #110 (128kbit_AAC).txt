[SPEAKER_02]: Hi there, friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: This video you're about to watch is a
companion video for Shaping Fire episode
[SPEAKER_02]: 110 with special guest Ethan Russo all
about the scientific aspects of
[SPEAKER_02]: Delta-8-THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured it was kind of hard to focus
only on the medicinal aspects of
[SPEAKER_02]: Delta-8-THC when there is so much
discussion about the legal aspects of
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not Delta-8-THC is actually
legal from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farm Bill or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not a legal expert, so I went and
I got you one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very happy that Craig Crado Science
had a webinar last week that included a
[SPEAKER_02]: section on the legality of Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their guest, attorney Lauren Ruddock,
has graciously offered her part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: webinar to you so that you can check it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the time this was a paid webinar and so
they're they're willing to pull out this
[SPEAKER_02]: little piece for you so that you can get a
really good solid understanding of the
[SPEAKER_02]: legality or illegality of Delta-8-THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you to Crado Science and
especially thank you for attorney Lauren
[SPEAKER_02]: Ruddock for sharing this piece with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lauren began her career in litigation,
spent a decade litigating a wide variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after her mom used cannabis to address
terminal illness, Lauren became a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: advocate and from there has pioneered one
of the most successful practices dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a contributor to Marijuana Ventures
Magazine and serves in leadership
[SPEAKER_01]: positions in a wide variety of cannabis
associations around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she serves clients in many states and
has been a driving force in legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: in the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, Lauren.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Ethan and Anisha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so happy to be here and to,
you know, share a stage with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we're going back to when Ethan and
I first met in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the opportunity to be his moderator
at the Emerald Cup and it's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous working collaboration since
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very happy to be here and, you know,
excited to discuss all matters,
[SPEAKER_00]: D8, legal matters.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Julie, do you want to share the screen?
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Ethan described in far greater
detail and using actual science,
[SPEAKER_00]: D8 is a psychoactive, intoxicating
cannabinoid that occurs naturally in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants, including cannabis that
meets the definition of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get into that in a little bit,
albeit in very small quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: As most of you probably know, distribution
of medical and adult use cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be limited to intrastate
activity, meaning no interstate commerce
[SPEAKER_00]: and sold strictly in medical or adult use
retail dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, D8 can be found almost anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order it through the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can purchase it at a local wellness
store, even at gas stations or big chain
[SPEAKER_00]: grocers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably wondering how that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because most D8 does come from
hemp and hemp is federally legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really wish it was that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on to the next slide, Julie,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of today, there is virtually no
consistency in application or enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: between federal and state law or between
and among the various states regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp-derived cannabinoids, including and
especially Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'll explain in a bit, there does seem
to be some legal precedent providing
[SPEAKER_00]: stability in this area, literally evolving
in real time, the case decided just last
[SPEAKER_00]: week or the week before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk about that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I want to take a quick step
back to give you a very basic
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of the legal framework of
hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 2018 Farm Bill defined hemp to
include all derivatives, extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts,
and salts of isomers with a Delta-9
[SPEAKER_00]: tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not
more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really referring to hemp
biomass or oral material when we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, if it meets this definition,
is excluded from the definition of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, which is classified as a
Schedule I substance under the Federal
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlled Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet THC, including those naturally
occurring in the cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as their synthetic equivalents,
remain controlled Schedule I substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right away, we have this immediate
tension and conflict with respect to
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp-derived THC, and the courts and the
DAA are publicly grappling with this
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most Delta-8 on the market as Ethan noted,
is not naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, most D8 on the market has been
converted or synthesized from CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is critical because while the DEA
consistently maintains that cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which naturally derive from hemp,
are hemp and are thus exempted from the
[SPEAKER_00]: CSA, the DEA feels very differently about
cannabinoids that have been synthesized or
[SPEAKER_00]: chemically treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go on to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the DEA has taken a pretty strong
position on the matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the DEA, the synthesizing
process renders this otherwise legal
[SPEAKER_00]: substance illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In mid-August of 2020, the DEA promulgated
an interim final rule, which purports to
[SPEAKER_00]: classify as a Schedule I substance all
synthetic tetrahydrocannabinols.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this includes THC, THCV, THCA,
and Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: In various letters and correspondence
issued by the DEA in 2021 regarding hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: programs in Alabama and Florida,
DEA maintained that synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, including hemp-derived
Delta-8 that was converted from CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the CSA, yet hemp-derived THC that
met the D9 concentration, 0.3% total THC
[SPEAKER_00]: or less, are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now looking at some of the final
finished products, not just the floral
[SPEAKER_00]: material or the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most recently, while indicating
that new rules are coming, in February of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2023, DEA reiterated that Delta-8 that has
been converted from CBD is, in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: a controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So following the DEA's line of reasoning,
if the DEA naturally occurs in hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: that hemp was grown in a 2018 farm bill
state, the legal inquiry can stop as
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally occurring cannabinoids are
clearly exempt from the CSA pursuant to
[SPEAKER_00]: the 2018 farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the DEA has been converted from
CBD, the legal status is far less clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anyone who's considering
distributing Delta-8, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to turn on your appetite for
risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I want to talk a little bit about
state laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could go to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even after resolving this matter from a
federal perspective, we have to now turn
[SPEAKER_00]: to state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as with everything involving cannabis,
state laws differ on how to treat DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until very recently, the trend was for
states to come down very hard on Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: So legal status really does vary from gray
to outright illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states which had not yet operated
under the 2018 farm bill have not updated
[SPEAKER_00]: their definitions of hemp to include
isomers, derivatives, extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and or cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Delta-8, very unclear as to the legal
status in those states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other states deem any form of THC a
controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states, such as in New York,
regulate DEA specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many states simply follow the FDA,
particularly when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: inclusion of cannabinoids, including
hemp-derived cannabinoids in food and
[SPEAKER_00]: beverage products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know the FDA follows the DEA,
so a little bit of a circular argument
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still, no analysis of hemp-derived
cannabinoids would be complete without
[SPEAKER_00]: considering the Federal Analog Act of
1986.
[SPEAKER_00]: DEA could be considered an analog because
it shares structures similar to Schedule I
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs or because the actual intended
effect is substantially similar to or,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some instances, greater than a Schedule
I drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of basis to consider whether Delta-8
should be regulated like THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're sufficiently confused,
it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are most legal experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this confusion was sure to spark
lawsuits, and the wave has certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: decidedly begun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So multiple states, including New York,
Arkansas, Alabama, Oklahoma, Oregon have
[SPEAKER_00]: passed laws that restrict or otherwise
render illegal production and sale of
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8 products, of Delta-8 generally,
and products that contain Delta-8 and the
[SPEAKER_00]: lawsuits have begun to try to take those
laws down.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we go to the next slide,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps our federal court system will
resolve this tension, starting with a
[SPEAKER_00]: decision earlier this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: The case is styled Biogen versus Sanders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brought in federal court in the
Eastern District of Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plaintiffs were Biogen of LLC of
Fayetteville, a drippers vape shop of
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenbrier, the cigarette store of
Colorado doing business as smoker
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly, and Sky Marketing Corp of Texas
doing business as hometown hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a big win because what the
plaintiffs ultimately did was preclude
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement of this law on the night
before the law was supposed to take
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a very big legal deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lawsuit named the governor,
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the attorney
[SPEAKER_00]: general of the state, the directors of the
Arkansas Department of Finance and Admin,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Tobacco Control Board, the State
Department of Agriculture, the State Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Board, and the 28 prosecuting attorneys of
the state as defendants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they named everybody who has any impact
or any finger on the pulse of the
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement administration of this law in
Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plaintiffs sought an injunction
prohibiting enforcement of this bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bill criminalized all hemp products
produced as a result of synthetic chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: process and any other psychoactive
substance that was derived there from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plaintiffs did argue that the act was
preempted by the 2018 farm bill and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the act's provisions were
unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the court agreed and entered an
injunction barring the state from
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcing the act.
[SPEAKER_00]: In its ruling, the court made a series of
pronounced comments, which they do apply
[SPEAKER_00]: only to the law in Arkansas, but they
could nonetheless establish a precedent
[SPEAKER_00]: upon which all similar probative state
programs could be invalidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to this end, the court ruled that the
act is preempted by federal law,
[SPEAKER_00]: a concept known as conflict preemption,
because Arkansas has already joined the
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018 farm bill and the 2018 farm bill does
not limit its application to method by
[SPEAKER_00]: which derivatives, extracts and
cannabinoids are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the downstream products result
from plants that contain less than point
[SPEAKER_00]: three percent THC, they are legal hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important here, the state did reject
any notion of testing based upon a post
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylation method.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that has been proffered
by various states and the DEA,
[SPEAKER_00]: as this reads qualifiers into the
definition of hemp beyond that was what
[SPEAKER_00]: was intended by the 2018 farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The court also found that the act was
preempted by federal law on a concept
[SPEAKER_00]: known as express preemption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although states are in fact allowed to
regulate the production, growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation of hemp more strictly than
federal law, they cannot restrict
[SPEAKER_00]: interstate commerce of hemp products,
including hemp derived products,
[SPEAKER_00]: if those products derived from lawful
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here the act in Arkansas would have
precluded commerce of hemp derived Delta
[SPEAKER_00]: eight products that were lawfully produced
in other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the court found that the act was
vague and thus void.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, laws can be very ill conceived,
but the court found that the act contained
[SPEAKER_00]: terms that would confuse even an
exceptionally intelligent reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: To this end, the act contained terms like
continuous transportation, synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: substances, psychoactive substance,
none of which were actually defined in the
statute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The act also made references to dangers of
misuse risks to the public, all of which
[SPEAKER_00]: are highly subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was hardly a basis upon which the
court felt wielding criminal sanctions or
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal penalties was appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go on to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So still thinking about distributing D
eight, maybe, you know, if you're thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about a distribution strategy that
involves Delta eight and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate legal exposure, you know,
know the science, make sure you really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to spend your resources on a product
that, as Ethan said, likely only exists
[SPEAKER_00]: owing to federal illegality of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely want to retain attorney who
is expert and fluent in hemp regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These laws are changing on a weekly,
sometimes daily basis analysis that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: done in one state a month ago,
likely to be stale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really got to keep up with the,
with the regulations as they change and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't just rely on your lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to become an expert in all
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're expecting a new iteration of the
farm bill this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could resolve all outstanding matters
regarding intoxicating cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of their hemp derived or
cannabis derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to be your own expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to retain attorneys and you have
to have an ongoing dialogue because any
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution strategy has to be very
flexible and adaptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would recommend maintaining low
production runs, giving how quickly the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory landscape changes in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would recommend strong representations
and warranties and written contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was the hemp grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: How the products were produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: How to shift the risk of regulatory
compliance?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if somebody gets hurt?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then be sure to seek indemnification
because, you know, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: representations and warranties are very
little if you don't have legal recourse to
[SPEAKER_00]: enforce them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my practice pointers to the
extent that anyone is interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: engaging in the D8 space, even after
hearing Ethan's presentation and knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are really far superior
products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for staying with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the science is far sexier than the
legal technicalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, while this legal exercise
is somewhat thrilling for us lawyers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do continue to strive for consistency
and application.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for clear rules that are
easy to follow, that are rooted in actual
[SPEAKER_00]: science, of course, not racial animosity
or any desire to suppress political
[SPEAKER_00]: speech, which is how cannabis wound up on
the Controlled Substances Act in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, we just really need to stay
on top of Delta 8, the distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 8, and decide for ourselves whether
this is a cannabinoid product that we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue promoting as we see further
liberalization of cannabis generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
