[SPEAKER_00]: moment and put it on vibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, please note that the feedback sheet
is on your tables and at the side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: IndoExpo would love to have your feedback
so they know who to book for future
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next speaker is Peter Conjoyan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Conjoyan is a private sector
researcher and consultant whose career has
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on helping small and mid-sized
commercial greenhouse growers operate
[SPEAKER_00]: profitably.
[SPEAKER_00]: His current research focus includes the
areas of hydroponics and aquaponics in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and indoor production settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, Peter is going to talk about
conducting your own product trials on site
[SPEAKER_00]: to make more informed production
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please welcome Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Shago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hurting in the back, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to spend the next 45 minutes
talking about how a grower in his or her
[SPEAKER_02]: operation can reliably, correctly,
appropriately conduct product trials in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to make decisions on what products
you might want to use in operation,
[SPEAKER_02]: compare site by site, etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask you to put your seatbelt
on, strap yourself in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got quite a bit that I want to cover,
and if you have questions, raise your
[SPEAKER_02]: hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'd prefer to get through my
presentation and save a little time at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end just so I can get through the little
bit of science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to allow me in these
45 minutes, I want to take everybody back
[SPEAKER_02]: at some point to middle school or junior
high school for someone my age,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to review the scientific
method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that phrase isn't enough for you to
get up and walk out the back door,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to have some fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why conduct on-site trials?
[SPEAKER_02]: You might say that you're looking to
reduce costs, production costs,
[SPEAKER_02]: which would save money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might say you want to look at crop
performance and quality, increase yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: which will raise revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what reason,
in the end, we want to make more money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a private sector researcher and
also a commercial greenhouse operator,
[SPEAKER_02]: after my academic days ended and I
returned to the private sector,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the bottom line, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though I've spent time on faculty
at universities, it's the real world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I really enjoy operating from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Question, have you conducted product
trials?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone in the audience, have you done this
in your operation?
[SPEAKER_02]: And perhaps before I even ask for that
show of hands, who's with me today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have growers?
[SPEAKER_02]: You folks, I'm from the outside your
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm commercial ornamental crops,
poinsettias, geraniums, I'm edible
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponic vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herb crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our terminology differs a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say grower, you say cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say cutting, you say clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we will be able to get through
the 45 minutes together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how many growers or cultivators do we
have here today?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many of you are in the state of
Colorado?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have anyone outside of Colorado?
[SPEAKER_02]: I came from Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are we from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, have you conducted product
trials?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you confident with your results?
[SPEAKER_02]: And was a product or practice changed?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have time in the 45 minutes for
me to welcome you in to answer these
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are the questions I thought we
should put on the table for us to think
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we conducting onsite trials?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, whose claims are you going to trust?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not here to stir any pot or create
any trouble, but the manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_02]: the distributor, the sales rep walk in the
trade show, there are claims the length
[SPEAKER_02]: of, well, the height of a 14er.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are we going to trust?
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a phrase at one booth claiming
backed by science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this statement concerns me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much folks for the booth that is
using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That booth might be based in science and
reputable and credible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not criticizing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I walk around your trade show as a
traditional horticulturist used to my own
[SPEAKER_02]: trade shows with greenhouse products and
systems, we don't have that phrase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I asked myself, why is this industry,
why did somebody feel like they need to
[SPEAKER_02]: say that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may be what's bringing us together
in this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many products.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you and I as growers going to sift
through that to make a decision of what
[SPEAKER_02]: product to purchase?
[SPEAKER_02]: I went around yesterday through the trade
show and counted the number of booths
[SPEAKER_02]: featuring LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are about seven different
manufacturers, perhaps 10 or a dozen at
[SPEAKER_02]: most.
[SPEAKER_02]: Booths offering lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went around this morning before the
trade show opened and counted fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiological products, and I lost count
after 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after describing my world as commercial
greenhouse production, commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture, we don't have a fraction of
that many booths offering fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of confusion that you as
a grower are feeling as you walk around
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to decide what products to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's this group from?
[SPEAKER_02]: We already covered that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for inviting me today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good thing it wasn't next week,
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't have me here from Andover,
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now most of you being from Colorado,
I tipped my cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brady and Peyton Manning had battles over
their careers, and I congratulate you on a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of years ago with Peyton going out
on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep waiting for Brady to decline,
but he keeps digging down into the bag of
[SPEAKER_02]: tricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What brought us together today?
[SPEAKER_02]: What brings a commercial greenhouse
operator researcher like me to your
[SPEAKER_02]: educational program?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my statements is, or my sense is,
cannabis is evolving, ladies and
[SPEAKER_02]: gentlemen, into a mainstream commercial
horticulture crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a mainstream commercial horticulturist,
I welcome, welcome fellow growers and new
[SPEAKER_02]: crops, and I predict within two or three
years that at our national greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: conferences, we will be offering tracks on
cannabis and inviting you folks to join
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Agree or not, in horticulture,
my opinion is a plant is a plant is a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, and I know that some folks in this
industry don't like hearing me say that,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I'm gonna qualify it a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's perhaps a qualification to
pharmaceutical injection regulations,
[SPEAKER_02]: and during a couple of presentations
yesterday that I sat in and attended,
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while the culture and production of
cannabis, in my mind, a plant is a plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's some of those post-production
restrictions and characteristics that do
[SPEAKER_02]: separate it from some of our other crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of similarities to what I'm
used to working with, the photoperiodism
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis and poinsettia are identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nutrition of tomato and cannabis are
similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, my point, a plant is a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were here in the previous
presentation, one of the speakers used one
[SPEAKER_02]: of her favorite phrases that healthy roots
mean healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my own version of that,
and as my children brought their grammar
[SPEAKER_02]: school classes to our greenhouse each
spring for field trips, my phrase to the
[SPEAKER_02]: youngsters was, remains happy roots make
happy shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I share that with fellow growers,
we're never too old to learn, and some of
[SPEAKER_02]: those phrases are timeless and ageless.
[SPEAKER_02]: An observation, your industry
traditionally grows indoors and is
[SPEAKER_02]: expanding into the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine traditionally grows in the greenhouse
and is expanding indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: With vertical farming and locally grown
vegetable and food crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks, we have a lot of grower-grower
experience to share with one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am humbled that you invite me into your
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would graciously invite you into mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being a lifelong grower, I'm one that
does not believe in clothes, shop,
[SPEAKER_02]: trade secrets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that together we're stronger,
and the more we share, the more time we
[SPEAKER_02]: spend together, the better we become as
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is research?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a trial?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had more time with you today,
we'd get into some detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: What differentiates a research experiment
from a trial?
[SPEAKER_02]: For today's purpose, I'm going to say
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either one, executed well, will generate
more useful information than the other if
[SPEAKER_02]: executed poorly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my message in this 45 minutes is,
how are we going to execute it well?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to run this trial or
experiment so that we learn something and
[SPEAKER_02]: have confidence and change a practice or
bring on a product because of our work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a ground rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you write anything down and want to
write this slide down, this is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be objective.
[SPEAKER_02]: The opening page of a plant physiology
textbook from my graduate school days at
[SPEAKER_02]: Ohio State University starts out like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good observer doesn't see what he's
looking for if it's not there,
[SPEAKER_02]: and does see what he's not looking for if
it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about that just for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first part of that, we want to make
sure we're not biased.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have an expectation that a
fertilizer is going to generate a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: result, but if it's not there,
don't make it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second half says, okay, we're going to
be a good observer, and we master that
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific method.
[SPEAKER_02]: If something unexpected happens,
let our eyes see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's understand it and try to figure out
why it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Product categories that require a
unionized growers to make decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can walk around your trade show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We mentioned some of the booths,
growing medium, fertilizers, injectors,
[SPEAKER_02]: biological products, irrigation,
environmental control, pest control.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd go on the list, all the inputs that
you and I use to produce a crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within each one of those categories,
there are decisions to be made.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are salesmen coming to you saying,
buy my product, and you're the one that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make the decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to test some of these
things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a research greenhouse at Ohio State
where we're alternating mercury vapor and
[SPEAKER_02]: high pressure sodium lamps to try and even
out the spectrum of supplemental light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of you in indoor production don't
have the luxury of this height from the
[SPEAKER_02]: light to the crop canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, with that height,
we can spread and even out that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my research greenhouse at
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the left is a flood and drain
experimental system.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the right is a nutrient film channel
system that I do most of my vegetable and
[SPEAKER_02]: herb research in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I constructed a growth chamber in one of
my warehouses several years ago for a
[SPEAKER_02]: project I was involved in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working with LED light technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really exciting and advancing
technology, as you're all aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking at tailoring spectrum and
adjustable intensity.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that put together, for me as a
researcher, I'm looking to use this
[SPEAKER_02]: technology to reproduce sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question I'm asking as a scientist is,
does this technology give us enough power
[SPEAKER_02]: to reproduce the sun?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we do that, if the answer is yes,
we can reproduce sunlight with intensity
[SPEAKER_02]: over the course of the day, dynamic
spectrum as the day progresses,
[SPEAKER_02]: then I believe we can optimize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can reproduce it reliably,
then I think that final step is to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to do that, this is an aerial of
my greenhouse range outside of Boston.
[SPEAKER_02]: This house is where I conduct most of my
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the warehouse with that growth
chamber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can put together what I'm
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's exciting for me is to be indoors
conducting research 100 feet away from the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse conducting the same research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we can learn how we're going to
manipulate, maximize, optimize either of
[SPEAKER_02]: the environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shift gears.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to put some pictures in so that
it's not all bullet point slide for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a commercial greenhouse
installation of dosatron injectors for
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer injection, nutrition control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see with the five injectors,
different size injectors, we've got
[SPEAKER_02]: tailored nutrition opportunities,
selective flow, delivery.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty flexible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are systems more automated than
that pictured.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have enough time to show them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got all kinds of pictures from my
travels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to drop down to low
tech, flexible manual operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a picture of one of my
greenhouses, my propagation greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: where taking the same concept that we want
flexibility, we want control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me just walk through what we're
doing here in this irrigation setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got clear municipal water coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got acid treated water for mist
system and seed germination and cutting
[SPEAKER_02]: rooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've got my central fertilizer
injector that's supplying, in this case
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still talking about 200 parts per
million nitrogen rather than EC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's a little dark, but can you
see this dosatron on the floor?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on a five gallon bucket with a
different solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on how I valve this,
it's not automated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not solenoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't believe somebody that says it
has to be automated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still do it by hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can select clear water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can select simply the acidified clear
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, before I go there, if I want a
light fertilizer solution, I would take
[SPEAKER_02]: clear water valve, run it through that
dosatron, pick up 100 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want my standard 200 part per million
nitrogen, I select that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And down below there's a bypass to the
dosatron.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you bypass it and 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I decide that I've got a very hungry
crop, then I can go ahead and take the
[SPEAKER_02]: 200, pass it through the second injector,
pick up another 100 and have 300.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's all kinds of flexibility that
you and I can install in our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't have to be computer
controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a project I'm working on with MIT
called Open Ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we happen to be working with the
Ferrero company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're familiar with the chocolate covered
hazelnut in the bold foil, Ferrero Rocher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they came to MIT in the Open Ag
project wanting us to build them
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled environment growth chambers so
that they can mimic climate anywhere on
[SPEAKER_02]: the planet and test hazelnut cultivars
rather than plant them for 10 years and
[SPEAKER_02]: need to wait in that native environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my backyard has a high tunnel with 500
hazelnut trees in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my role in the project is to maintain
the trees in a commercial environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: prep them for the research that we're
doing, and then recycle the trees after
[SPEAKER_02]: individual experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week we're going to start cold
temperature freezing studies on some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these dormant trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I put the picture up,
folks, this could easily be me setting up
[SPEAKER_02]: a growing medium trial, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have five different bags,
five different types of growing mixes that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a slow release fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see some of the pearls mixed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: This could as easily have been a slow
release fertilizer trial where each tub of
[SPEAKER_02]: soil had a different rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why conduct on site trials?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about some of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Performance in your condition,
side by side product comparisons,
[SPEAKER_02]: confirmed product claims, see it for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a number of reasons that we're
going to justify doing product trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who paid attention in school?
[SPEAKER_02]: We mentioned this earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: The scientific method, six steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, if we had time, I would push
you and let you, welcome you in to fill
[SPEAKER_02]: out the steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make an observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Form a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make an observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Climate is changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it man-made?
[SPEAKER_02]: Form a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the burning of fossil fuels
contributing to climate change?
[SPEAKER_02]: The scientific method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then design, conduct an experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Analyze, interpret the data, draw a
conclusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all very logical.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pleasure to take you back to middle
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Experiment design.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go through a few of these things
very quickly as we wind down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Objective, treatments, design of the trial
or experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after we execute it, we're going
to be collecting data, interpreting those
[SPEAKER_02]: data, and documenting it, coming up with
conclusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the objective.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to learn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before designing, before doing anything,
please think about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Answer these questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to learn?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like holy locks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to learn too much and try to
learn enough so that it's worth the
[SPEAKER_02]: effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to hear me say that over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please write it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not by hand in your personal
device or handheld device, record it.
[SPEAKER_02]: An example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Determine which cultivar of red leaf
mini-roaming lettuce grows best in my
[SPEAKER_02]: production system.
[SPEAKER_02]: An objective that's not too big,
not too small.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can sweet corn be grown in a controlled
environment system?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a flood and drain bench in my
greenhouse from last summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: The MIT project took us down to NASA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two summers ago, spent two days with NASA
scientists in a workshop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they told us that the goal is by 2029
or so to land astronauts on Mars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what blew me away is when they kind of
explained to us, the food has to be there
[SPEAKER_02]: on the ground growing before they even
land because we can't afford to send
[SPEAKER_02]: enough food with them for the trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all this has to be done robotically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the human even reaches the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I grew the corn in the greenhouse,
people say that doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can easily say to them, yeah,
but we might have some of our fellow
[SPEAKER_02]: humans on Mars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they might look for corn on the cob on
July 4th in 2030.
[SPEAKER_02]: Design.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge difference between me, a researcher,
and you, a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The researcher can afford to kill plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grower cannot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to throttle back experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I set up a scientific study as a
researcher, I can bracket my treatments
[SPEAKER_02]: and include enough of them so that I know
some plants are going to die or not
[SPEAKER_02]: perform well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that allows me to create a data set
that is very descriptive.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a grower, you can't really do that
often because you need to grow that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and sell it for a profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So throttle back, but still that
Goldilocks thing, have enough treatments,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not too many.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many?
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough to be meaningful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so many to be unmanageable.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a control and why is it important?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the most important segment of a
discussion like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a control plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Control plants is one that we don't do
anything to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the plant that we're going to
compare everything else back to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spent 20 years researching the growth
hormone ethylene on ornamental crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the impatience plant on the screen is
a single plant in a four inch pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 hours before taking this picture,
the entire plant was in full bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drew a string across the middle of the
plant, sprayed the right hand half of it
[SPEAKER_02]: with ethylene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a dramatic effect with pedal
abscission after 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: The control is this side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a nutrient filled channel
experiment using lettuce as a subject from
[SPEAKER_02]: a project a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the project involved different
chemistries to treat the water to control
[SPEAKER_02]: algae and biofilm and waterborne diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were looking at different rates and
you can see some effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I hadn't had the control folks,
what are we going to compare these
[SPEAKER_02]: different treatments to?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can only compare one treatment to
another, but we have to have that control.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had a dime for every time a fellow
grower called me, and said to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter, I used the ethylene spray on my
hanging baskets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first question back to that grower on
the phone is always, how do the treated
[SPEAKER_02]: plants compare to the controls?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I had a dime for every time the
phone went silent, or the comment was,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sprayed everything, or I forgot to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to make that point that a
control plant, if nothing else,
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves this room with you, have a good
appreciation for a control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always one that says you can have
fun with horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can do all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got two control sections on that
plant and two treated.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, with design.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my flood and drain system,
four separate benches, reservoirs,
[SPEAKER_02]: four separate pumps, each with a timer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's relatively inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can look at four different
fertilizers if I choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could look at four different flood
depths and cycle frequencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want to give you a few ideas on
how you go about setting up trials in a
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from an experiment where I was
hand-watering potted plants with different
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't have enough plants to
warrant an injector.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't want to waste time having to
flush line an injector every time I
[SPEAKER_02]: switched the suction tube to a different
solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this experiment, I simply used tubs
with the final solution strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each tub has a pump and a dedicated
hand-watering hose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able to do four different
treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a tub off to the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, just another picture giving you
ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of you have probably or likely set up
your own trials similar to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing someone else's picture oftentimes
increases or raises your level of
[SPEAKER_02]: confidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's that nutrient film study again
where each treatment channel has a
[SPEAKER_02]: dedicated five-gallon reservoir,
a small pump inside each, pumping the
[SPEAKER_02]: water up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the tube and it runs down through
the channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've seen nutrient film technique,
that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just trickling a thin film down
the channel and the plant roots enjoy that
[SPEAKER_02]: environment with all kinds of aeration
along with the solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you can see where 10 different
channels, 10 different pumps, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe $300 of material here to set up this
trial and design it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, a researcher relies on a small
sample set accurately reflecting an entire
[SPEAKER_02]: population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stay clear of bringing statistics
into a talk like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just going to dance around it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're relying on a few plants as our
subjects to represent the rest of our
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to be really careful about how
we're handling and treating those subject
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsets averages everything power of
three, if you've heard of it, and
[SPEAKER_02]: randomization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't want to use one plant to
single subject because something might go
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong with that one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's too important a decision to rely
on just one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have two, that's better than one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we have two plants and they respond
differently, which one's right?
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as we add the third one,
magic happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon as there's three, two of them might
group themselves to one side and there
[SPEAKER_02]: might be a third that's an outlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have a little more, our
confidence level rises because we have the
[SPEAKER_02]: two plants reacting similarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that all make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: So always use at least three plants if
you're going to use three.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more the better, but you can't use too
much room in the production facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an experiment that I'm going
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see three blocks or three
different replicates in the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the treatment, this is a, looking at a
pulse treatment of water sanitizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we determined in the earlier trial that
continuous exposure to the sanitizer was
[SPEAKER_02]: phytotoxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember all those lettuce plants were
smaller than the control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that told us in the next time,
let's try a different tactic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to look at a pulse,
a 30 minute pulse, either daily,
[SPEAKER_02]: every other day, or weekly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on how this is valved,
I can send that pulse solution through the
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: The power of three, you can see very
clearly here, each of those headers has
[SPEAKER_02]: three of the tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have three nutrient filled channels
for each.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see randomization here where all
of the green are not next to one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mix them up because you might have
temperature hotspot or a cool spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have light differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So randomization and replicates and
replication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that enough time spent on those things
without putting everybody to sleep with
[SPEAKER_02]: statistics?
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, I could hit everybody overhead,
over again, label it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you have a much better memory than
I do and most of your fellow humans,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not going to remember at the end of
a crop cycle what was done months or weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please write it down, label it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Experimental control, two meanings folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: One we've already covered, that control
treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second is control of the experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you practice good control, that will be
uniformity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have poor control, variability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Variability is an enemy when we talk about
statistics and trying to draw conclusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So number one, you want to experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to experiment control treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, you want to practice or learn
how to exercise good experimental control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor control introduces experimental
error.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the differences due to the treatment
or other factors because of the poor
[SPEAKER_02]: control?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to eliminate those other
factors of poor control and have a higher
[SPEAKER_02]: level of confidence that your differences
are due to the treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Example of growing media trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's say you're going to sample
and try three or four different growing
[SPEAKER_02]: mixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they all going to be on the same drip
zone?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say yes, that's going to be one big
mess of experimental control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because likely the reason you're trying
these different mixes is because they
[SPEAKER_02]: either have better different aeration
properties, different water holding
[SPEAKER_02]: capacities, different nutritional back
profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're watering them all on the
same zone at the same time, one's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be too wet, one might be too dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might end up at the end with some
really cool differences and say that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: best.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I'll say to you, because of that
experimental error that you incorporated,
[SPEAKER_02]: that lack of control, your confidence may
not be very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go through this what are you
going to measure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we execute this trial or experiment,
we have to collect data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with this mini pak choi that I'm
working with in this slide, it might be
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are all about bud weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many other crops that I work with,
plant height, number of branches,
[SPEAKER_02]: number of flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to measure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write everything down if I've made my
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Label it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Data analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do the numbers mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps we can come back next year and we
can talk a little bit more about some of
[SPEAKER_02]: those details.
[SPEAKER_02]: Conclusion errors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two important points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say something's different when it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you run your trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking at A versus B.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you end up, your trial says A is
different than B.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Product A is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's not really true, we're wasting
an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to switch product A because
it's really no better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're wasting our time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other type of error is saying
something's not different when it actually
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Product A is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, our trial might not have been
designed properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have missed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might not have been able to show
product A is any better.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the case, then we missed out on
an opportunity to pick product A because
[SPEAKER_02]: our trial wasn't designed properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the conclusion, did you accomplish your
objective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you raise more questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't be frustrated when this
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good experiments are designed to answer
one question and they will raise new ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the scientific process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn, learn, learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever get tired of learning moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to end with this same observer
comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It deserves a second mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good observer doesn't see what he's
looking for if it's not there and does see
[SPEAKER_02]: what he's not looking for if it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shango, are we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got about seven minutes for
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comments or questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a question, raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring you the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get one started, Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are setting up these experiments,
what kind of thought do you need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the uniformity of the equipment that
you're using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the photographs that you had
showed very complex piping systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: but do you need to make sure that
everything is the same length?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has been cleaned the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far do you need to go in your controls
in that category?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice question, Shango.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to depend on the experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say, I've described to you some work
I'm doing with water treatment,
[SPEAKER_02]: algae control, microbes, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very important there that we're not
contaminating from treatment to treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flushing lines or making sure that
dedicated lines are installed for the
[SPEAKER_02]: trial, that's very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a growing medium study,
well, there's not so much concern there
[SPEAKER_02]: about the delivery of the irrigation
solution, but let's say that the growing
[SPEAKER_02]: medium study is looking at different
biological products, Michael Reisey,
[SPEAKER_02]: other bacteria that might be incorporated
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see where on a small scale,
if you're mixing in a tub like I showed in
[SPEAKER_02]: the picture, in between or shifting from
one product to the next, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: cross contaminate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That qualifies as experimental error and
loss of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I haven't answered... You've answered
it well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your time trying to do research in
Canada, what challenges have you found in
[SPEAKER_01]: a state where it's not fully legal or is
that in between?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have any study having interrupted
or protesters?
[SPEAKER_01]: What challenge have you encountered by
trying to do a research with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not yet attempted to research
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Massachusetts, we just had recreational
pass legislation a year or so ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone can help me understand how I get
a research
[SPEAKER_02]: for whatever, a license or whatever,
that's what I'm waiting for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not yet touched the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be our last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What research should be done with regards
to the spectrum for lighting and in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of yield of any kind of target?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question about spectral composition
and LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, not anything with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine has been more with leafy greens and
colleagues of mine at Michigan State
[SPEAKER_02]: University, Purdue University have
published where the spectrum, we may have
[SPEAKER_02]: been making a little bit bigger,
a deal out of it than we're actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: the data are actually supporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think three years ago around the trade
show, you saw a lot of single wavelength
[SPEAKER_02]: or spectral control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, most of it's white.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're finding that in a general white LED
lamp, we get the red, the blue,
[SPEAKER_02]: we get a little bit of green.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of what we're finding in a lettuce
production is red leaf lettuce that I
[SPEAKER_02]: showed a picture of spiking the blue as
the crop nears maturity triggers some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the pigmentation so that we can have a
deeper colored red leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent question and I think we've kind
of passed, we blew right through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was about tailored spectrum a
few years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, in a practical application,
most of it's white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, we are out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it together for Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out of time, go ahead.
Thank you.
Thank you.
