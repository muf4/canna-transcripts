[SPEAKER_02]: There is no doubt that after sheer
curiosity, the most common reason people
[SPEAKER_02]: become interested in cannabis is pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pain is terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It interrupts our lives, occupies our
minds and emotions, and becomes the boss
[SPEAKER_02]: of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pain takes the last of our will to do
things, limits our activities,
[SPEAKER_02]: and is emotionally crushing as it repeats
incessantly that things are out of our
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that we are living in a broken body.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the drugs commonly prescribed by
Western doctors offer little help,
[SPEAKER_02]: cost a great deal, and in the end,
often leave us craving and addicted
[SPEAKER_02]: physically, which just adds to our feeling
of powerlessness.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if you have carpal
tunnel, a broken back, an incurable
[SPEAKER_02]: disease, or are just too sore from working
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pain limits us and weighs on us
emotionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But prior to prohibition, the American
pharmacopeia was filled with uses for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to fight a variety of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humans have been using cannabis for pain
and discomfort for generations,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that prohibition is unraveling,
we have access to cannabis medicine like
[SPEAKER_02]: never before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is incredibly safe, far safer than
prescriptions, and can be grown and
[SPEAKER_02]: prepared at home.

[SPEAKER_02]: Today my guest is cannabis pharmacologist,
Adi Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Ray PhD is a National Institutes of
Health-funded neuroscientist who has been
[SPEAKER_02]: studying cannabis, opioids, and their
interaction for her entire career.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has a strong publication record in
chronic pain, addiction, and harm
[SPEAKER_02]: reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Ray is currently an assistant
scientist at Legacy Research Institute in
[SPEAKER_02]: Portland, Oregon, and holds a joint
faculty appointment at Washington State
[SPEAKER_02]: University.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is also co-founder of Smart Cannabis,
a data-driven cannabis consultancy focused
[SPEAKER_02]: on connecting all humans with the best
cannabis for their needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also produce one of America's most
respected cannabis competitions and
[SPEAKER_02]: education events, the Cultivation Classic
in Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we're gonna talk about transitioning
from using opioids to cannabis for
[SPEAKER_02]: treating pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, Adi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so great to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate you sharing some of
your valuable time with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that even during a pandemic,
you are busy, busy, busy, so thank you so
[SPEAKER_02]: much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, since we're gonna be talking a
lot about how opioids and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: moderate the experience of pain,
I think we should probably get all on the
[SPEAKER_02]: same page about what pain is and how we
experience it biologically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on physically in the brain
that senses pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain is a very useful phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a feedback system that our body uses
to keep us alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we didn't have pain, we wouldn't know
that we were encountering things in our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that are potentially hazardous
to our tissue and to our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a great example of this is people who
have a congenital insensitivity to pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is, you know, they can walk over
coals and they can break their arm and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can burn their hands and have
absolutely no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these individuals end up living very
short lives because we actually need that
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback from our environment to protect
our tissue and our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pain is the phenomenon where our
central nervous system, our brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: registers noxious information from our
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's all well and good, but there
are a lot of conditions under which that
[SPEAKER_00]: system goes haywire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, you know, if you have an
individual with an amputee, that
[SPEAKER_00]: individual can often end up developing
phantom limb pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, they have pain in the absence of
that biological thing that the pain is
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that example tells us that there's
something more than just you have nerves
[SPEAKER_00]: out in your fingertips and in your arms
and in your skin, which are transferring
[SPEAKER_00]: information about the environment into the
spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that signal is being sent up to the
brain and the brain is putting together a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of what the environment is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more complex than, you know,
merely a sensory system that is
[SPEAKER_00]: integrating information inside of our
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brain really has a powerful role in
constructing what the environment and what
[SPEAKER_00]: the body is going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pain, although it is a useful thing,
it also can really go haywire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those things that go wrong
happen at the level of the brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily at the level of the
tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: That phantom limb example that you gave,
I find extraordinarily interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been explained to me before that
pain takes place in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I normally find that to be
kind of a semantic difference that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly helpful to patients,
but it is very interesting when talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about secession of pain with opiates and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet, occasionally I'll come across a
healthcare worker who says, no,
[SPEAKER_02]: describing that pain is in the brain is
very helpful for patients because it
[SPEAKER_02]: allows them to have an understanding that
they can manage their pain with thought
[SPEAKER_02]: and perspective and with drugs instead of
they are a victim to their hip or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really complex thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're absolutely true that pain does
take place in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have, you know, a whole network of,
you know, brain structures that are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in constructing that picture for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when I was an early
postdoc, my first year as a postdoc in
[SPEAKER_00]: Sydney, I went to a talk that was given by
a number of folks who were involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical pain work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, Australia was really
cutting edge in their view of pain because
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually gave chronic pain its own
disease category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like pain is a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chronic pain is a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that still doesn't really have,
you know, chronic pain doesn't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of recognition here in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm at this talk as, you know,
a budding pharmacologist and physiologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my job was to measure
neurotransmitter release that was being
[SPEAKER_00]: released from neurons in brain slices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard, hardcore physiology and
pharmacology, you know, drugs interacting
[SPEAKER_00]: with the brain receptors and then,
you know, changes happening in neuron
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm watching this talk and I'm seeing
these patients and I'm hearing them
[SPEAKER_00]: describe their lives and how they're able
to have these absolutely debilitating
[SPEAKER_00]: injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet they wake up every day and they
say, yeah, you know, my pain's at about an
[SPEAKER_00]: eight today, you know, sitting here in
front of you in this chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you be physically registering so
much bodily sensation and yet totally
[SPEAKER_00]: nonplussed, just completely fine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, from this talk,
I really began to understand that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cognitive component of coping with pain,
walking with pain, living beside pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: that ability resides wholly in our brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is totally within our control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is, you know, a testament to
the power of our thought, the power of our
[SPEAKER_00]: cognition and our attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we pay attention to grows and
magnifies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that you necessarily turn
your attention away from the pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: although, you know, that is one coping
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more shifting your attention to
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and as a pharmacologist,
I'm like, well, what the heck am I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what is my, I'm trying to like
make better pain therapies and make better
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, all we need is
meditation and coping strategies and
[SPEAKER_00]: cognitive behavioral therapy and
biofeedback.
What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, pain lives in the brain and we
have an enormous amount of power and
[SPEAKER_00]: control over it if we can learn the tools
to harness it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we'll, we'll talk a lot more
about cannabis as a distractant later on,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I want to double down on your
experience with the, the mental,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the powerful mental capabilities of,
of pain patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm very grateful that I haven't
had a lot of pain in my life, except when
[SPEAKER_02]: I had an injury and rotated my L5 and was
in like a hysterical amount of pain more
[SPEAKER_02]: than I'd ever been in my life where I was
just like squirming on the doctor's table
[SPEAKER_02]: because my mind was, was just all,
was all bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I meet patients through,
you know, teaching about cannabis medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: and traveling forward and everything,
and, and I meet these folks and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and like you said, they, you know,
they are having an eight day, but they are
[SPEAKER_02]: presenting themselves as calm,
cool, and collected at the talk or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, we get together kind
of like on the side and we sit next to
[SPEAKER_02]: each other and we talk and I'm trying to
understand the nature of their pain so I
[SPEAKER_02]: can make some sort of recommendation to
them because that's what they're there
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more we talk about it,
it brings them mentally away from their,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, let's say meditative life
where they're just, they're focusing on
[SPEAKER_02]: the doingness of life and intentionally
distracting themselves from the pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as they describe it more in detail,
you can see the, the defenses coming down
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, very often by the time we're
done understanding the nature of their
[SPEAKER_02]: pain, they are shaking and in tears.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only thing that's changed is that
part of us doing, you know, what we were
[SPEAKER_02]: there to do was they needed to let down
their guard and be vulnerable for a
[SPEAKER_02]: moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they let down their guard,
I got to truly see the pain expressed
[SPEAKER_02]: through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's very difficult as
somebody who's trying to help somebody to
[SPEAKER_02]: not get like, like sucked into that
experience of compassion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can't just sit down with
them and start crying too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to tell you, working with pain
patients and getting to know them and
[SPEAKER_02]: being one for a while in a small way
really has given me huge respect for
[SPEAKER_02]: people who deal with chronic pain every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of things in there that I
want to unpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of which is that attention,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're, when you're paying
attention and you're really digging in and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at it and describing it and
putting words to it, I'm going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I, I also let's, let's start
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that attention, I, I worked with a
fibromyalgia patient once who told me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I noticed that on my worst pain
days, those were the days I was taking my
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids and I couldn't tell if,
you know, I was taking the opioids because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was my worst pain day or if my pain was
worse because I was spending so much time
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about, should I take a half a
pill or should I take a whole pill today?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the body scan, the physical body
scan of looking for the pain, that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes the pain real, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was going through her process of
waking up in the morning and doing her
[SPEAKER_00]: body scan and just by paying attention to
it, that's what fed the need for her pain
[SPEAKER_00]: relievers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, that makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's so sad too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, could you think about like how
many individuals are doing that this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Waking up and going, Oh boy, what kind of
day is it going to be today?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and really going in and looking for
it and digging into those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and if you're over 35,
you can, you can find that within your
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to, there's some spot
that ails all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, that's what it's like to
have a body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other component that you talk
about is that emotional component of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my colleagues and I at WashU in St.
Louis, we put out a paper in the journal
[SPEAKER_00]: Neuron last year and it was in mice and
some of it was in rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we demonstrated is that the
physical, the bodily sensation of pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: the emotional or affective component of
pain are inseparable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are two symptoms of the same
phenomenon that are being driven by this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this little network in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we have been going about
treating pain from the bodily,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sensation of it for many
decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the whole reason that
opioids exist is we've been trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: anesthetize the physical sensations of
pain with this drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our work demonstrates that you can't
just ignore the emotional component of
[SPEAKER_00]: pain because it is literally wrapped up in
the exact same brain areas and the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: same mechanisms that are happening with
the bodily sensations of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this, you know, like roughly 80
plus percent of patients with chronic pain
[SPEAKER_00]: also experienced some kind of mood
disorder like anxiety, depression,
[SPEAKER_00]: or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's no surprise that, you know,
people who are in chronic pain also have
[SPEAKER_00]: depression because that is literally the
manifestation of chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has both a bodily component and an
emotional component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever we do to treat pain,
chronic pain, we have to think of the
[SPEAKER_00]: organism holistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to think of the emotional
well-being as well as the physical
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being of the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I really like the fact that you
focus so much on the vocabulary of pain as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting, people who are new
to their pain, they often struggle to
[SPEAKER_02]: describe it because, you know,
luckily up to this point in their life,
[SPEAKER_02]: they haven't had to describe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas people who have had lifelong pain,
you know, they can describe it on a number
[SPEAKER_02]: chart and they've got all these different
flavors of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they've got like a Crayola box,
you know, of descriptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about that for a moment
because so often people who are coming to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis for pain, one of the challenges
that they have is delineating between the
[SPEAKER_02]: types of pain, either for themselves like
in their pain journal or to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that there are different types
of pain, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a big difference between the sharp
and stabby pain from a fresh fracture
[SPEAKER_02]: versus the kind of like mind boggling
everywhere experience when you're having a
[SPEAKER_02]: flare up of rheumatoid arthritis,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't actually know anything about
this part of the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you use as a, as I guess a range
of how to describe pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you're right in that no
one's pain is like anyone else's,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems important to think about like,
is this throbbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it stabbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the clinic, those kinds of things
are really useful from a diagnosis
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, because you can say,
ah, this is these kinds of descriptors
[SPEAKER_00]: would indicate an inflammatory condition,
which means we need to treat it in this
[SPEAKER_00]: way versus, oh, those kinds of district
descriptors indicate some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some kind of damage to the nerves or
some kind of problem with the transmission
[SPEAKER_00]: of the nerve signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so those kinds of pain are better
treated with these modalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of vocabulary is really
important in the clinic for diagnosing a
[SPEAKER_00]: path forward for treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, on the other hand, you know,
I tend to make the argument that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, once you've gotten past that
initial, you know, diagnosis stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know what kind of pain you're
dealing with, you know, then it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really matter because it's all subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all only happening to you inside of
your own brain from your perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one's pain is similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can have two individuals who
have the exact same injury, like a rib
[SPEAKER_00]: fracture, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same rib, same spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet their descriptions of the pain,
how much the pain bothers them,
[SPEAKER_00]: how that pain interferes with their life,
it's all totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yes, on the one hand, being able
to have words for your experience is
[SPEAKER_00]: really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also when you're in a community
setting and you're, you're getting support
[SPEAKER_00]: from other people who have the same kind
of ailment that you do, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: validating to hear, Oh yes, that's exactly
what I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so comforting to know that
another human being feels what I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, it's totally
subjective and irrelevant because all that
[SPEAKER_00]: matters is how you feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're feeling bad in any way,
whatever those bad words are, then that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a starting point for how can we start
feeling better?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we shift the attention,
the conversation, the treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the therapy, your day?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we shift all of that so that
whatever descriptors you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to feel better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's follow up on that because it is so
common.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like your example of the same dislocated
rib in the same place and two people will
[SPEAKER_02]: have different experiences of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so incredibly common that the person
who's experiencing more pain, whereas
[SPEAKER_02]: other people experience less pain,
are written off as being a wuss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they can't handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're immature.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're being a baby about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always think that invalidating
somebody else's pain is not legitimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly there are situations where
we want to encourage someone to not focus
[SPEAKER_02]: on their pain, which is a different thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But invalidating a patient having their
pain invalidated by friends, family,
[SPEAKER_02]: or even a health practitioner is just
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to hear what you have to say
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to me, the perfect example is the
hysterical one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For how many hundreds of years,
women do experience more chronic pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: women have more painful things that are
associated with childbirth and
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction, hormonal imbalance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for many hundreds of years,
that was completely invalidated and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were seen as the weaker sex and we were
shunned by psychotherapists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me is like the most extreme
example of totally invalidating someone
[SPEAKER_00]: else's experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel very grateful that now we live
in a time where we are slowly being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to recognize that each individual's
reality has as much value as anyone else's
[SPEAKER_00]: reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really inspired by my undergrad
students who come through the laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are like privileged white kids
who go to a private school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet at the same time, they go,
oh, I'm sorry, I can't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a trigger for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone respects that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, wow, this is a next
evolution in humanity we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really encouraged by this idea that
we're all coming to accept that if this is
[SPEAKER_00]: real for you, then it's real for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I imagine that in a chronic pain
textbook in the school, there's a chapter
[SPEAKER_02]: on the different types of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a section on inflammation and
there's a section on nerve damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you study chronic pain intensely and
for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so will you give us a general
understanding of the different categories
[SPEAKER_02]: of chronic pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, they fall into three big buckets,
which two of which you mentioned already,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the inflammatory pain,
the neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is, you know, some kind of damage
or dysfunction in the nervous system that
[SPEAKER_00]: is causing pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this other weird one,
which is like this mysterious,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sort of central pain,
something like fibromyalgia where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't really pin down exactly what's going
wrong with any particular part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet the organism is still reporting
that they're in severe pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that those are the three broad
categories, the inflammatory, the
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathic, and then the centralized
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there there can be a lot of transition
from either inflammatory pain to central
[SPEAKER_00]: pain or neuropathic pain to central pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for instance, where you have an
injury that totally resolves, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some kind of, you know,
car accident or work related injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: The injury is totally resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet the brain for potentially the rest
of its life is still keeps registering
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of discomfort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there can be a transition from one of
those two types to centralized pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also there tends to be an
inflammatory component to even neuropathic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, especially in the early days of the
development of neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for instance, chemotherapy induced
neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people who often survive cancer will,
you know, they'll beat their cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they'll be stuck with this neuropathic
pain that was induced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapeutic drugs attacking the
central nervous system or the peripheral
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say peripheral, that's
everything outside of the brain and spinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cord and central nervous system is the
brain and spinal cord itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, chemo drugs will attack the
nerves throughout the body and leave the
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this lifelong pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the very early days of the
development of chemotherapy induced
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathy, there is an inflammatory
component, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those chemotherapeutic drugs pull in the
brain's immune system or I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the body's immune system and all of our
processes that we have for fighting off
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it recruits our inflammatory processes
to start the damage to the nerves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although, yes, you can sort of put
things roughly into these buckets of
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammatory pain where you have all of
these, you know, the body recruits certain
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules to draw blood and draw attention
to, you know, some invading process or
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get swelling, you know, edema,
redness, soreness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more fluid in joints, for
instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all of those like that's a very
molecular process where there's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot of like molecules, you know,
flying around, going crazy, doing their
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs, hustling and bustling to try and
keep this organism alive to the extent
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is, you know, somewhat
maladaptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have so much of the body
trying to protect itself that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, you know, really painful for the
person who has the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that although you can put
inflammation in its own bucket,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is largely an inflammatory component
to neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then either one of those things can
develop into a central pain once the
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation has gone away, once the nerve
has totally regenerated or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever other neuropathic thing might
have happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna, let's change directions a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we have established, you know,
what playing field we are on with pain and
[SPEAKER_02]: that pain is experienced in the brain,
let's talk about opioids themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're not gonna spend a whole lot
of time talking about the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the pharmacology of opioids because that's
not really what we're about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think anybody who's here and listening
has already made the decision that they
[SPEAKER_02]: already wanna move away from opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, however, if we're talking about
replacing opioids with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: we certainly need to have an understanding
of what opioids do, what their method of
[SPEAKER_02]: action is so that later on in the show we
can compare that to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you give us an understanding of
what opioids are doing and why there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: belief that that decreases pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that you're right that,
you know, a lot of your listeners are here
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of Americans and Canadians and
people all over the world are interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis because it is so obvious that,
you know, opioids are nasty drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we clearly have a huge overdose
epidemic on our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, opioids are really good drugs
under very few conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the whole reason they exist
is because they are profoundly good at
[SPEAKER_00]: turning off the bodily sensations of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are profoundly good at sort of,
you know, somewhat anesthetizing the body
[SPEAKER_00]: and not allowing it to experience the
physical, you know, sensations of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are really good at that because
they act in the brain itself to shut off
[SPEAKER_00]: the sensations of pain that are coming in
through the spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can imagine all of your nerves
are like little tiny highways of
[SPEAKER_00]: information and all those highways are
headed in one direction and that is into
[SPEAKER_00]: the spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that spinal cord becomes like this
central hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the main highway and all of
the information coming through those tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little, you know, arteries are coming
through the central highway of
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, going into the
headquarters, which is the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so opioids shut off the sensation of
pain at the headquarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my academic work has always been
focused on one particular brain area
[SPEAKER_00]: called the periaqueductal gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really is the brain's pain
headquarters because it is, if you put an
[SPEAKER_00]: opioid directly into the periaqueductal
gray or the PAG, if you put an opioid
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you shut off pain throughout the
entire body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put opioids everywhere else,
but you block them only in this brain
[SPEAKER_00]: area, then you don't get any pain relief
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know that this is a critical
component in, you know, the controlling or
[SPEAKER_00]: modulating the sensation of pain
throughout the entire organism,
[SPEAKER_00]: this tiny little brain area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really interesting about this brain
area also is that it's where the body or
[SPEAKER_00]: the brain develops tolerance to opioids as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you repeatedly give the
brain, you know, just this PAG region,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you repeatedly give it opioids,
it will develop tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you block opioids here,
but continue to give the whole rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: body opioids, the organism never develops
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a really critical brain region
and we'll talk more about it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we get to the cannabinoid control
over pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But opioids bind to receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this brain region, so you can think of
it as a lock and a key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these locks, these receptors are
studying the outside of our neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just little padlocks, you know,
waiting for their keys to come floating by
[SPEAKER_00]: and those keys, the drugs, the opioids
themselves come and they float along and
[SPEAKER_00]: they lock into the binding sites on these
proteins and they turn on certain
[SPEAKER_00]: intracellular signaling cascades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are molecules that once they
become activated by the binding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids to these proteins, they go off and
they do some other job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They control neurotransmitter release.
[SPEAKER_00]: They turn on genes, you know, they control
other proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole very sophisticated set of,
you know, intracellular and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: between cellular communications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sum total of all of those,
like, you know, hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of little, you know,
protein-protein interactions, the sum
[SPEAKER_00]: total of that is the organism not
experiencing pain because it has been shut
[SPEAKER_00]: off at the level of the brain itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, Adi, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the best explanation I have ever
heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you, you know,
I mean, I know you've got a PhD and at
[SPEAKER_02]: some point you probably had to teach
classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably an awesome teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy being in the classroom,
but, you know, I feel like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations like ours where we get to
talk to the lay person, I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: equally important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, that explanation was a very
nice balance of using accurate scientific,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say, like how it actually works
while also using vocabulary that we're all
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with so that you don't sound like
a textbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's use me for a straw man for a
minute because at your description,
[SPEAKER_02]: opioids actually sound like they'd be
really effective, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like listening to your description,
I'm like, well, hell, maybe these actually
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is this all this trash I've been
talking about opioids not justified and
[SPEAKER_02]: the problem is actually more the abuse
than the fact that they don't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in my own personal experience,
and like I said earlier, I haven't had a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of experience with pain, but after I
had my ACL surgery after a skiing
[SPEAKER_02]: accident, they gave me opioids to help
with the pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, you know, as a psychonaut,
I'm like, oh, I'm gonna get to try
[SPEAKER_02]: something new, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I used it and my experience was is
it really did not do anything to help with
[SPEAKER_02]: the pain, but it made me feel like the
pain was maybe down the hallway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it kind of distanced me from the
pain a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I certainly found it to be a bit of a
fun distractant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was a novel mind state that was
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after the first day, I'm like,
you know, I don't really, it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: helping, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And mostly it made me stupid for
everything else I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is my experience typical or is my
experience, you know, more fringe?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it might be a little bit of
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when you asked the question,
like, Hey, you know, 80, you made this
[SPEAKER_00]: sound phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are really powerful drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you have to keep in mind that the
PAG is not the only place where these
[SPEAKER_00]: opioid receptors live.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live on lots of other brain
structures, and they live in lots of other
[SPEAKER_00]: important places in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, in the brain stem,
the area that's like our old evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: lizard brain, the thing that keeps us,
you know, ticking automatically keeps our
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's the area where you also have
opioid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they get hit over the head too
hard, they will shut down your breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how people die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So respiratory depression is, you know,
essentially what happens in an overdose
[SPEAKER_00]: people's breathing rate slows down so much
that it stops entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that process is controlled by the
brainstem by the same receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same receptors that are in your PAG
turning off, you know, pain for your whole
[SPEAKER_00]: body are also in your brainstem
controlling your breathing rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not only those two areas,
but you know, like you said, I stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: taking these drugs after my ACL tear
because I felt stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were making me dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is these receptors
are also in your prefrontal cortex,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your brain regions that are used
for making decisions and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like being a functional human.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you turn off all the brain activity at
the level of the opioid receptor there,
[SPEAKER_00]: then of course, you're going to get some
cognitive impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that we
unfortunately don't talk enough about with
[SPEAKER_00]: the opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I was testifying in the
State House in Jefferson, City of Missouri
[SPEAKER_00]: one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one of the chairman was
asking me, well, what about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cognitive impairment, you know,
that comes from cannabis and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like people, you know, driving while high
and all of this stuff that they were,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, no one ever talks about
like how many people in this courtroom
[SPEAKER_00]: right now took an opioid before they got
in their car and drove 60 miles to get
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like this, this element of
cognitive impairment that you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about is a very real side effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, opioids would be great drugs
if they only acted on the descending pain
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway, but they have all of these other
unintended consequences, constipation,
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory depression, cognitive
impairment, addiction, because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: binding to receptors that are not just in
the brain's pain pathway, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: binding to the receptors indiscriminately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, especially that last
component, the addiction component,
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids are better than any other
substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're totally hijacking the brain
regions that are involved in reward and
[SPEAKER_00]: reinforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, those are very fundamental brain
processes where, you know, if something
[SPEAKER_00]: activates this circuitry, this reward
circuitry, you know, the perception at the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of the organism is, ooh,
that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should do that again, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's the reward and the
reinforcement is, you know, continuing to
[SPEAKER_00]: engage in that behavior because of the
reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, opioids are particularly good at
hijacking those processes so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids feel better and over time become
more important than anything else that
[SPEAKER_00]: activates that system naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the opioids become more
important than food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opioids become more important than lasting
relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opioids become more important than,
you know, what your neighbors think of
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opioids become more important than your
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's where all of these
unintended consequences happen from pain
[SPEAKER_00]: control is that, you know, the opioids
aren't just binding to the brain's pain
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're binding to all the receptors that
control all of these other very important
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now you've like totally unraveled
all the impressiveness I had earlier for
[SPEAKER_02]: it because now it just sounds like a messy
drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a super messy drug.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, before we go to our first commercial
break, you know, people started turning
[SPEAKER_02]: against opioids or at least publicly in
the media when people started getting an
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of the level of abuse in our
country and how quickly people were moving
[SPEAKER_02]: from pharmaceuticals to street drugs
because they were more affordable and in
[SPEAKER_02]: many places more accessible since you
don't need a prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so people realize that our
country has got a chronic addiction
[SPEAKER_02]: problem with opiates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then that seems to have created an
environment where some in the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: establishment have finally kind of taken
the risk of saying, oh, yeah, and they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't really work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you really have to dig for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not usually something that's in the
first paragraph or the first couple
[SPEAKER_02]: paragraphs of an article.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like down in like paragraph 10,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, oh, and by the way,
you know, is it true that the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: establishment is starting to kind of turn
away from the efficacy of opioids?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think finally, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think for a very, very,
very long time, there were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like us fringe weirdos, you know,
scientists on the side saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, opioids cause hyperalgesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they make pain worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hey, opioids actually,
you know, like all of these other negative
[SPEAKER_00]: side effects, they outweigh the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like our little fringe
voices that are, you know, clearly based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the evidence that we've been collecting
for a long time, our voices, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't matter much in the face of,
you know, really hot pharmaceutical reps
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, like lobbyists with a lot
of money and doctors who don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: time to develop and devote to,
you know, being skeptical and digging
[SPEAKER_00]: through the literature themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're relying on, you know,
the standard of practice from their clinic
[SPEAKER_00]: and the recommendations of the American
Pain Society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're relying on these
pharmaceutical reps to give them the best
[SPEAKER_00]: tools to do their job in the shortest
amount of time possible, because they only
[SPEAKER_00]: have an average of 13 minutes with each
patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah, I think that for a long time,
you know, we knew that opioids weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: effective, you know, over the long term,
that their side effects outweighed their
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that there were, you know,
some fundamental pharmacological problems
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the basic neuroscientists knew
that, you know, oxycodone at the molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: level is no different than heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, you know, it took a crisis of
this magnitude to wake everybody up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: reality that it doesn't matter,
you know, if you're using heroin or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using oxycodone, the results are
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body becomes physically dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you have to have some other
strategy if you want to have a sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: and healthy management of chronic pain
over the long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that sounds like a perfect place to
end our first set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Aidy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is cannabis
pharmacologist, Aidy Rae.
[SPEAKER_02]: In times like these, when so many cannabis
companies are growing their flower in
[SPEAKER_02]: gigantic warehouses and fields using
synthetic nutrients, it is good to know
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are authentic California
heritage growers using natural farming
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques and sunshine to cultivate
cannabis flowers for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: California has produced the best cannabis
in the world for generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea that massively scaled
industrial cannabis production could
[SPEAKER_02]: produce the same quality as small batch
lovingly cultivated flowers is just silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moontime Medicinals is located in Humboldt
County on the lush south fork of the Eel
[SPEAKER_02]: River watershed in the epicenter of the
American cannabis heartland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moontime Medicinals grows under bright
California sun in greenhouses using only
[SPEAKER_02]: natural farming techniques like
hugelkultur, compost teas, whole food
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizers, and fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every part of their growing process plays
its own part in nature and nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic is injected into the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The result is big, beautiful cannabis
flowers with wide ranging terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_02]: that taste like great cannabis should.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live in California, ask your
budtender for Moontime Medicinals and
[SPEAKER_02]: visit Moontime Medicinals on the web and
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moontime Medicinals is also available as
part of the Redwood Roots family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moontime's whole flowers appear in Redwood
Roots curated joint packs alongside other
[SPEAKER_02]: heritage cannabis cultivators like Lady
Sativa Farm, Ridgeline Farms, Humboldt
[SPEAKER_02]: Redwood Healing, and others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moontime Medicinals, top shelf cannabis
grown in harmony with nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are lots of good seed makers out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every once in a while, someone becomes
legendary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mendocino, California cannabis breeder
called Mandelbrot is one of these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandelbrot was also known as Ross Truth,
and his cultivars are known as the
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation for the Emerald Triangle's
world-famous gasoline-scented terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day when it was really hard to
find quality genetics and education,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandelbrot was advocating for organic
growing techniques and providing
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptional seeds that would sell out as
soon as they hit the shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandelbrot lived too short a life,
dying in 2015, but while he was with us,
[SPEAKER_02]: he created several connoisseur-level
cannabis masterpieces like Oil Spill,
[SPEAKER_02]: The Truth, and Royal Cush.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter if you approach growing cannabis
more as a toker or a breeder, you will
[SPEAKER_02]: find something that delights you in
Mandelbrot's selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because while some strains are better to
grow or to smoke, Mandelbrot's creations
[SPEAKER_02]: excel in every category, and that's why
people keep talking about them even today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Mountain Legacy continues the Ross
Truth tradition by preserving these
[SPEAKER_02]: coveted genetics for future generations,
unchanged as they were originally created
[SPEAKER_02]: in the mid-2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Mountain Legacy also creates
tasteful, modern crosses to Mandelbrot's
[SPEAKER_02]: classics.
[SPEAKER_02]: These lines, worked by Mandelbrot's
brother Ben, furthers their family's
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics in a spirit that Mandelbrot
himself would have preferred.
[SPEAKER_02]: For 20 years, Humboldt Seed Company has
been family-owned in providing reliable,
[SPEAKER_02]: high-yielding seeds originating in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: While the current trend is to slap one
super-male into a line of hype strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt Seed Company continues to breed
with precision and care by doing large
[SPEAKER_02]: sifts and back-crosses to emphasize the
absolute best traits that a line has to
[SPEAKER_02]: offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This kind of breeding takes time,
talent, and space to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what kind of aroma you are
particularly into, Humboldt Seed will
[SPEAKER_02]: likely have something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you love fruit, you can choose from
banana, mango, apricot, papaya,
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry, blood orange, melon,
and lemons across their various strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have all-gas, glue, and classic sour
diesel lines as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there are the heritage
California strains like OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Herr, and Headband, and their
award-winning blueberry muffin is one that
[SPEAKER_02]: delights just about everybody's palate,
especially when concentrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt Seed Company is proud to bring to
market the infamous freak show Cultivar
[SPEAKER_02]: II, which has a great THC high,
but looks so much like a fern that some
[SPEAKER_02]: folks can't even identify it as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a plant that really needs to be seen
to be believed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking for well-balanced CBD
seeds, Humboldt Seed Company can turn you
[SPEAKER_02]: on to CBD strains that actually have
flavor, like the dill and pepper terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: of Willie G.'s Lebanese Land Race.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you are looking for regular,
feminized, or autoflowers, Humboldt Seed
[SPEAKER_02]: Company has the gear to make this your
best growing cycle ever.

you can pick them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also check out their Instagram at
The Humboldt Seed Company to check out
[SPEAKER_02]: their gorgeous flowers and the
extraordinary freak show plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt Seed Company, let them know
Shango sent ya.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Lose, and our guest
this week is cannabis pharmacologist,
[SPEAKER_02]: Ady Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during the first set, we made sure that
we were all on the same page about what
[SPEAKER_02]: pain is, how it functions in the body,
and what opiates are attempting to do in
[SPEAKER_02]: providing some relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're all here because we want options
other than opioids, and so that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna go to in this set.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ady, I know that you have an expertise
in how cannabinoids function in the brain
[SPEAKER_02]: and specifically decreasing the experience
of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that I just want to start
just by kind of like tossing you the mic,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will, and saying, what are the main
methods or modes of operations that
[SPEAKER_02]: someone of the cannabinoids that we are
familiar with at this point are acting in
[SPEAKER_02]: the brain to provide relief in different
ways than opioids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with how they're similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we talked about the
mechanisms by which opioids relieve pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they bind to this area of the brain
that I've focused on my entire career,
[SPEAKER_00]: the PAG, periaqueductal gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So opioids float along and they bind to
their receptors like locks fitting,
[SPEAKER_00]: or keys fitting into their locks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabinoids work, especially delta 9
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC works in the exact same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC floats along into the PAG and binds to
its receptors, studded along the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of these neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really fascinating is that the
mu opioid receptor, which is the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: pain relieving target, and the CB1
cannabinoid receptor, they are cousins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both G protein coupled receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of protein they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an extremely similar structure
and an almost identical function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're both coupled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside of the cell, they talk to the
same sets of messengers, GI, GO proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of the, you can imagine,
you know, on the left hand and the right
[SPEAKER_00]: hand, you have the mu opioid and the CB1
cannabinoid receptor both sitting there
[SPEAKER_00]: like locks waiting for their keys to come
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those keys bind, the locks change
shape a little bit and then release their
[SPEAKER_00]: messengers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those messengers are identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that fascinating?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's totally cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same brain region, same kind of protein,
same second messaging system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the result is also the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have a change in
neurotransmitter release and a change in
[SPEAKER_00]: the descending control of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the primary way that
delta 9 THC relieves pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's acting in the exact same place by the
exact same way that opioids are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about how, you know,
the opioid receptors don't just live in
[SPEAKER_00]: the PAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live in lots of other brain areas and
in the brainstem and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: inside, you know, the viscera,
inside your, you know, your internal organ
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity and CB1 cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CB1 cannabinoid receptors are also
everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's really fascinating is that
somehow by activating the CB1 receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: with delta 9 THC, yes, you still get some
activation of the reward pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have this, that that's what
causes mirth and euphoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what is rewarding and reinforcing
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delta 9 THC binding to CB1 receptors
in the brain's reward pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the difference is that it doesn't
hijack the brain's reward pathway in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that opioids do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't prioritize cannabis or THC over
everything else in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also doesn't bind to those receptors in
the brainstem, which control respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why, you know, you can't have a
lethal overdose from respiratory
[SPEAKER_00]: depression from THC is because that's just
not how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have anything to do with
respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah, the, the mechanisms
fundamentally are identical to how opioids
[SPEAKER_00]: work in terms of, you know, turning off
the pain signal at the level of the PAG,
[SPEAKER_00]: the brain's pain headquarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the differences lie in everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other really interesting thing about
the CB1 receptor in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is that it is the most ubiquitously
expressed G protein in the entire brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean by that is if you,
you know, were to dye all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors green and then zoom in and try
and find where they are, they look like
[SPEAKER_00]: stars in the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're literally everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost impossible to find a brain
tissue that doesn't have some level of
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that says less about, you know,
what the brain is doing in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, but it says more about how important
the CB1 receptor is in evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: How, if it is, if it's on every single
neuron in our brain, pretty much,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is it doing there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the role that that
receptor plays in our everyday function is
[SPEAKER_00]: huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have endogenous cannabinoids,
you know, like 2AG and anandamide and a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of little, you know,
set of cousins that are similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those little molecules have very
important jobs in regulating our brain
[SPEAKER_00]: activity, which regulates all of our
homeostatic processes, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that keep us alive, our
metabolism, our circadian rhythm,
[SPEAKER_00]: our responses to stress, our ability to
relieve our own pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CB1 receptor has an incredibly
important role in all of those homeostatic
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for whatever reason, you know,
evolution has set it up to where if you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, stimulate the mu opioid
receptor, you end up with some pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: gnarly consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you stimulate the CB1 receptor,
you end up with, you know, kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: balance of what could potentially be some,
you know, risky things, but mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: innocuous things like relieving pain and
experiencing mirth and euphoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, it's so nice to hear
somebody actually use the word mirth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard that word in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably, you know, only read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's remarkable how many of the same
plays, I'll say, that Delta 9 THC has
[SPEAKER_02]: that's in common with the opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somehow it's also equally as messy and
not as targeted.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the fact that when Delta 9 THC is
being messy, it's not causing all these
[SPEAKER_02]: other frickin problems that opioids do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's more benignly messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, what's even crazier about
that, Shingo, is it gets even messier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it gets even messier,
it becomes even safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by that is, you know,
we are capable of ingesting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 9 THC by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ends up not to be a very
enjoyable process, unless you're like a
[SPEAKER_00]: daily dapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's very few people who really
enjoy totally overloading their brains,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, solely with Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most human beings, if they consume THC
by itself, it ends up, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially once you get up and over a
certain dose, it ends up not being super
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of the safety and part of the
tolerability of cannabis is that Delta 9
[SPEAKER_00]: THC isn't acting alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being consumed with scores of other
biologically active molecules like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol and all of the terpenes and
all of these flavonoids and alcohol or
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, aldehydes and esters.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these other molecules that are all
working together to make a really messy
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that, you know, because you have all
of these molecules which are competing for
[SPEAKER_00]: binding sites, some of them are activating
processes while others are simultaneously
[SPEAKER_00]: turning things down, what you end up with
is a really buffered effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could imagine, you know,
I love music and I think about the world
[SPEAKER_00]: from the perspective of audition mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about, if you have a
tone, a pure tone, I want you to imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: like B, that gets really old, really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not particularly pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like literally a one trick
pony, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It has one job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what, you know, an opioid does
or that's what Delta 9 THC does by itself
[SPEAKER_00]: is just one note.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you start adding in all these
other tones and layering it with all these
[SPEAKER_00]: other things, what you end up with is
white noise, which is what we use to put
[SPEAKER_00]: babies to sleep, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that buffered effect, when you have
that principal component in there doing
[SPEAKER_00]: its job, very important job, relieving
pain, activating CB1 receptors in the PAG,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you add in all these other molecules,
which are also promiscuous, then you end
[SPEAKER_00]: up with this really buffered effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sum total of all of those
different molecules doing their jobs at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time is that you have a very
tolerable experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Ethan, Ethan Russo very
frequently, you know, has championed the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of the entourage effect or the
ensemble effect, which is that these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules work better together than they
do in isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, from my perspective,
the principal component driving the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect is just tolerability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are able to reap the medical benefits
of cannabis because it is simply more
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerable, not necessarily that it's more
effective, but that it is more tolerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that tolerability comes from
this buffered effect of all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules acting at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, let's go, let's circle around and
go back to the top of the slide again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just took us on this explanatory
trip of Delta 9 THC and how it works on
[SPEAKER_02]: pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I often tell patients, we have to
start over now and talk about cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's not just that cannabis helps
pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that cannabis helps pain in multiple
different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really have to treat them
independently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so let's go back to the top of the
slide and, and, and, and would you go
[SPEAKER_02]: through the same process with cannabidiol
CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD is a lot more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are at least 14 plus known
mechanisms of action of CBD in the central
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Delta 9, it's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a, you know, partial agonist at the
CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's largely it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabidiol, especially at,
you know, a range of doses does lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it is, it's actually a partial
allosteric modulator, a PAM at both the mu
[SPEAKER_00]: and Delta opioid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that does is, you know,
it puts the receptor in a position where
[SPEAKER_00]: it is more receptive to the endogenous
opioids that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like our body produces an andamide
into AG, our body also produces endorphins
[SPEAKER_00]: and keflins and lots of other peptides
that naturally act at our body's opioid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabidiol binds to the mu opioid
receptor, the primary pain relieving
[SPEAKER_00]: target in the brain to make it more
receptive and, and activatable by its
[SPEAKER_00]: endogenous peptides, like the endogenous
opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's at least one mechanism of action
that CBD could potentially be having in
[SPEAKER_00]: the central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think that the, the more
profound and direct effect that CBD is
[SPEAKER_00]: having is it is a profoundly
anti-inflammatory agent, as is TB.
[SPEAKER_00]: As are lots of the other molecules that
are found in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is especially why when we have
patients who are suffering from some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of inflammatory condition, cannabidiol
alone or in combination, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: combination with, you know, these other
molecules from the plant, it's profoundly
[SPEAKER_00]: effective because it is directly acting at
those anti-inflammatory, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I myself have seen,
you know, the knuckles of patients with
[SPEAKER_00]: rheumatoid arthritis and literally their
only thing that they engage in is putting
[SPEAKER_00]: a topical on their knuckles, you know,
every couple of hours, every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you don't have to be a
rheumatologist to look at someone's hands
[SPEAKER_00]: and go, oh wow, yeah, you look better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I think that, you know,
especially for patients who have an
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammatory component to their pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked earlier about how even
neuropathic patients, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people with neuropathic pain, often there
is an inflammatory component to
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wherever you have any kind of
inflammatory, you know, thing going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol is going to be an ally,
you know, especially if you're consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a whole plant preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I tend to refer to type three
and hemp cannabis as the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: nature's multivitamin for inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it truly is, you know,
so much better to take like 12 active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients that are fighting inflammation
from 12 different pathways than just one
[SPEAKER_00]: ibuprofen that does, you know,
anti-inflammation from one pathway alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, just in inflammation,
there are lots of different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: processes and lots of different kinds of
molecules involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you imagine a
construction site, you have all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are buzzing around,
you know, and from a 30,000 foot view,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a bunch of construction workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you really dive down in there,
you've got the welding guy, you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: plumber, you've got the electrician,
you've got the concrete person,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the engineer, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of these people, yeah,
they have different roles, but they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to this main effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same thing with inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the main effect is inflammation,
but there are all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules involved in that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're able to, you know,
knock out everyone in one of those roles
[SPEAKER_00]: that's contributing to inflammation,
you know, then you're clearly going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a better outcome than if you're only
going after the electrician.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's talk about a minute about
how fast this CBD works, because there are
[SPEAKER_02]: two different ways of thinking about CBD
helping pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first is that, you know, I've got a
whole plant CBD tincture in front of me,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what will the cannabinoids do for me
right now in this moment, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, lasting for the next,
you know, three hours, shall we say,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is usual efficacy for CBD or any
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's this, then there's the
second mode, which is people are taking
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD to simply supplement their
endocannabinoid system and strengthen it
[SPEAKER_02]: because a properly functioning
endocannabinoid system itself turns down
[SPEAKER_02]: the volume of pain and, you know,
helps with the homeostasis of all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different key body functions that when
they come back into balance, our
[SPEAKER_02]: experience and likelihood of pain is
decreased.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's something, you know,
the building up of an endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system is something where you need to be
taking whole plant CBD for a few weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: before it's really starting to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: on the endocannabinoid system as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you tease out the differences in
the patient experience of taking CBD about
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not the patient can take whole
plant CBD now and get benefits now versus
[SPEAKER_02]: taking CBD now, but taking it every day
for the benefit of my endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system in the future to decrease.
[SPEAKER_02]: my pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, Shingo, we're gonna need another
90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all, I want to say that I really
like to have evidence based conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, there's very little evidence
that CBD does anything acutely,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially at the common doses that people
typically take, you know, they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I have my, you know, like,
whatever, five milligrams in my soda in
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably does nothing except make
someone feel better via the placebo effect
[SPEAKER_00]: or the expectation that it's going to do
something, which I am not at all knocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a drug that does absolutely nothing
except make you feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that component.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are taking this thing, empowering
ourselves, taking our health into our own
[SPEAKER_00]: hands, expecting it to help us,
expecting it to make us feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because our brain is profoundly
powerful at creating that experience for
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's probably the most
immediate benefit that someone could get
[SPEAKER_00]: acutely from taking any dose of
cannabidiol is that the knowing that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're taking care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there could be some
underlying pharmacology that is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that, especially, you know,
within a certain dose range or after,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, taking it by a certain,
you know, inhalation route, particularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that we don't have the
clinical studies to tell us what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: acute pain relieving or any other of the,
you know, medical benefits of cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely have evidence to suggest
that over time, there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: bioaccumulation of CBD in the brain and in
the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids are very lipophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're stored in the tissue and our
fat tissue really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it does after a certain
level of accumulation, it ends up with
[SPEAKER_00]: like the slow release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we see this with the Dravet
patients with, you know, Epidiolex is CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with the FDA clinical
trials, we see that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a profound benefit, medical
benefit of, you know, daily consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, pretty high doses of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the doses that are given to
these kids are pretty whopping and it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be quite expensive to try and
recapitulate that on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are definitely more efficient
and cost effective ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, I think that that latter part of
your hypothesis that maintaining a healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system is by far the best
way to set yourself up for success for any
[SPEAKER_00]: health condition pain included.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that, you know,
we didn't mention was, again, going back
[SPEAKER_00]: to this affective component of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD is psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you hear all the time like,
oh, CBD is not psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that changes the brain chemistry
and the physiology of the brain is
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that CBD is psychoactive
because it shuts off seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts in the brain to change the
physiology of the brain to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD is psychoactive in that aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of its other psychoactive
properties is that, again, under certain
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions at certain doses, it relieves
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides positive affective,
positive emotional support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see this in the opioid world
because there's a researcher at Mount
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinai in New York, Yasmin Hurd,
who's been studying CBD for a very long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her work demonstrates that in people,
CBD profoundly reduces anxiety and that
[SPEAKER_00]: that reduction in anxiety is also
associated with a reduction in craving for
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So addiction, one of the primary drivers
for drug-seeking behavior when someone is
[SPEAKER_00]: in recovery, when they have been
physically dependent on a substance and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to come out of it,
one of the primary drug-seeking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, craving triggers is negative
emotions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel crappy and that feeling is a
trigger for seeking drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the affective or emotional support that
comes from, you know, chronically
[SPEAKER_00]: ingesting CBD, I don't think we can
underestimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be very difficult to
measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, given what we know from
these little bits and pieces from the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature that we do have, I think that
it is wise to say that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a rich endocannabinoid system,
a supplemented endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that's what you need, that will provide
both that bodily sensation support that
[SPEAKER_00]: you need as well as the affective support
that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's important to hit this one
more time because I really was caught off
[SPEAKER_02]: guard and pleased that you said that
taking CBD now does not have an acute
[SPEAKER_02]: effect, meaning it will help you now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, your example of taking five
milligrams of CBD in your morning soda
[SPEAKER_02]: cracked me up because I'm often telling
people, you know, you got to be really
[SPEAKER_02]: careful about how you're taking your
cannabinoids because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: your CBD gummies filled with crap sugar
and artificial coloring is probably doing
[SPEAKER_02]: worse for you than the CBD that you're
trying to get through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that it's important for us to
understand that taking cannabidiol is a
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term commitment and that if you want
to get relief from it, you've got to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you can't just take it when
you're feeling bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to take it every day on a
regular schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And heck, if you can take it every day,
small doses, two or three times a day,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's even better because you will
metabolize more of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the overall idea that, yes,
take cannabidiol to help your
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system, but also don't
forget that you should be doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle changes that are necessary so
that you ease off the trauma that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: giving your endocannabinoid system so that
you don't have to take CBD forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people, they start
taking CBD and they get these great
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're all like, oh,
I'm feeling so much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they get off of it and then they
feel like crap again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, oh my God, am I going to
have to take CBD the rest of my life?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, you know, you don't necessarily
have to, but you're probably going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: to start exercising and getting proper
sleep and not drinking coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then they're all like,
screw that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, I'll buy CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're absolutely right in that,
you know, CBD is far more like a
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrient than it is a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we think of taking a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially in America, that is our
expectation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why we have a healthcare system
built around commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the thing, make me feel better
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, that is our culture of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not how CBD works.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD works more like, you know,
Omega threes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually not that dissimilar from
Omega threes structurally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we don't take fish oil when
we have a headache, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not expecting fish oil to like
miraculously make us feel better in 30 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nutrient and it's a part of our
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if we're deficient in some way,
if we don't have the diet or we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the lifestyle to provide us that kind of
nutrient by some other means, we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement it by taking fish oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the exact same thing with
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not stimulating your own
endogenous cannabinoid system through,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said, exercise, sleep,
a balanced diet, acupuncture, all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that mimic the
endocannabinoid system, support the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system without the plant
derived cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not doing those things,
then clearly, yeah, you've got to make up
[SPEAKER_00]: for it by taking CBD as a micronutrient on
a very regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to be taking it on a
regular basis, it's going to be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might as well find out how to take
it in a way that's economical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's tons of products out
there that are orally ingested,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you can eat something or
drink something that has cannabidiol in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sad fact is that only about 5% of
what you swallow ends up making it into
[SPEAKER_00]: your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD has terrible oral bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means if you put it in your mouth and
you swallow it, hardly any of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting to your brain and the rest of your
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like the lungs, you know,
you've got about 50% bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at, you know, how much does
it cost you to, you know, vaporize a kilo
[SPEAKER_00]: of hemp flour versus how much does it cost
you to, you know, ingest 300 milligrams or
[SPEAKER_00]: rather 300 grams of CBD, if we're talking
like a 30%, you know, cannabinoid content,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like that's a lot of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, thinking about more
efficient ways to utilize that
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrient to support your
endocannabinoid system, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a good thing unless you are also using
it in combination with all these lifestyle
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like you said, you won't need to
use it forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's tease out one bit about using CBD
orally because I agree with you up to a
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the point is, you know, a lot of these
oral solutions and we'll talk more about
[SPEAKER_02]: this during the third set, but a lot of
these oral solutions like capsules and
[SPEAKER_02]: various edibles that have got CBD added to
them, you eat them and for that CBD to
[SPEAKER_02]: become accessible to the human,
they have to go through your gut and
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually through your liver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it takes time, plus you're
getting all the other, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: random sugars along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's a long road to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: In contrast, I find that patients get good
results with a whole plant ethanol
[SPEAKER_02]: extracted tincture because when they are
putting it in their mouth, whether
[SPEAKER_02]: sublingually or not, the ethanol acts as
such an effective carrier for cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: that the CBD is actually making the jump
through the mucosal membranes and the
[SPEAKER_02]: tongue and the cheek and the esophagus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time, you know, any remaining
fluid of the tincture gets down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: small intestine, it's all already been
soaked in other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what do you think about that
delineation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shango, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much because there are so
many products out there that are labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: as a tincture, which are, you know,
is a cannabinoid, which is an oil in an
[SPEAKER_00]: oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the same thing as a
cannabinoid suspended in a solvent like
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have some kind of oil in order and
if or if you have two bottles of tincture,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say one of them is oil and one of
them is ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, your best bet at getting those
cannabinoids into your blood is right in
[SPEAKER_00]: your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're going to use an oil
based, you know, quote unquote tincture,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you have to use it more like a
topical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to put it under your tongue and
you have to use your tongue to rub it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to rub it in under your gums,
into your cheeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to actually, it really is more of
a topical than it is a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: orally injurious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orally ingested product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right that with the ethanol,
there might be some chance of enhanced
[SPEAKER_00]: permeability right there in the buccal
tissue, the tissue on the side of your
[SPEAKER_00]: cheek, right in the sublingual tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a ton of blood vessels in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't it be great if you could just
take the cannabinoids and shove them right
[SPEAKER_00]: into all those blood vessels inside your
mouth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oral bioavailability typically refers
to when a drug is swallowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, clinically what we talk
about when we're looking at an oral
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a preparation that's swallowed,
which is kind of different than a
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation that is absorbed in the mouth,
which is, you know, a far more efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: way to take cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will pick up that topic again in the
third set when we start talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: dosing and methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's one more thing I want to hit
on before we go to our second commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: break.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you are very
evidence-based and so you may not have a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot to say about cannabigerol,
but I do want to talk about CBG because I
[SPEAKER_02]: was lucky enough to get my hands on a high
CBG, no THC plant material about a year
[SPEAKER_02]: and a half ago that was part of a R&D seed
grow in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that Seth's type four, Seth Crawford?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we might as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going to out him, but yeah,
this is the stuff developed by Seth and
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric Crawford at Oregon CBD there in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fantastic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was able to get some of this because
they know that I work a lot with patients
[SPEAKER_02]: and that I run a lot of dosing trials
because I think that one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges with patients using
cannabinoids is that everyone's using
[SPEAKER_02]: totally uncontrolled dosing and they're
just taking some.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that is important
about any kind of medicine is repeatable
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so I got this material and I did
ethanol extractions and we made a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: tinctures and I'll say RSO.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people know what I'm talking about,
but really we're talking about full
[SPEAKER_02]: extract cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we did a bunch of dosing trials
here on Vashon Island with pain patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because it was said in some casual
early CBG studies that it was really great
[SPEAKER_02]: for neuromuscular pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, all right, well,
you know, CBG is going to be the hot novel
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's find out how to actually take this
stuff so that when I talk to people,
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have my own firsthand
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I make this questionnaire and I take
the tinctures and the RSO and we cap a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of it up and we give it to a lot of
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And absolutely we got positive response
from people regarding their pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tends to act like a
non-intoxicating Delta 9 THC as far as the
[SPEAKER_02]: patient experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But where I'm going with it is this next
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: The part that was really startling was
that everyone said that it put them in a
[SPEAKER_02]: better mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I teased that out with
folks and it was decreasing people's
[SPEAKER_02]: anxiety about having pain at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you tease that out more,
this is how I explain it now to folks is
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, people turn to cannabis
for anxiety and pain, but THC tends to
[SPEAKER_02]: slather you know, I mean, I understand
that generally we're looking for doses of
[SPEAKER_02]: THC that you don't actually feel,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That don't cause intoxication.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at this point, few people take it that
way, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people think if you're not a little
high, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on people's actual experiences,
you know, Delta 9 THC slathers a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of intoxication over your anxiety and
pain and, you know, does decrease your
[SPEAKER_02]: pain and acts as a distractant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it involves some
intoxication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the CBD, it doesn't work for
today, but it's gonna work for next month
[SPEAKER_02]: if you take it for, you know, every day
for the next month.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG is a different category.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually makes the patients feel like
they are capable of handling their day or
[SPEAKER_02]: their pain with the resources and
abilities they have in front of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the patient said, you know,
like my pain is the same as yesterday,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I feel like I can just fricking handle
it more because of the change in attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're all like, I think that I'm
having some pain relief, but I can tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you one thing, I can cope with my pain a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love CBG for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with that, we kind of did a
secondary, you know, trial of people who
[SPEAKER_02]: had extreme daily background anxiety and
performance anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they took to it like a duck to water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, oh my gosh, this stops my
ruminating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, fear of social situations
and these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all a big setup to ask you,
as somebody who studies, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the pharmacological aspect of these
cannabinoids, have you seen any either,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, legitimate peer reviewed
evidence for what I'm describing or even
[SPEAKER_02]: some significant anecdotal or,
heck, since you know how these mechanisms
[SPEAKER_02]: work, I could imagine you might go,
oh, there aren't any studies, but from
[SPEAKER_02]: what you described, I bet you ABC is
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just gonna hand that whole
explanation to you on a big platter and
[SPEAKER_02]: say, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we'll start with the evidence
that we do have, which is pre-clinical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in petri dishes and animals and CBG is,
you know, kind of like cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is non-intoxicating and it is
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, you know, very similar to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, it is not nearly as deeply
studied as cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know exactly, you know,
all the mechanisms of action, which
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins it's interacting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, you know, it is
antioxidative and anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it looks like it's doing good
things and not bad things to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, at a very fundamental
molecular level, there does seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of basis that this could be a
profoundly therapeutic molecule because it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like it does a lot of good things
without causing impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with that said, the anecdote
that you just told me is the deepest and
[SPEAKER_00]: most wide anecdote that I have ever heard
about CBG because to date it has been nigh
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible to get enough of it to actually
give to a human being at a dose that would
[SPEAKER_00]: do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, this is changing now
because, you know, I think now we have
[SPEAKER_00]: this year will be really the first time
that we have large commercial operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are growing type four or CBG
dominant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll have the opportunity to do this,
you know, sort of real world scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment of putting this stuff in our
bodies and watching what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that there is some
fundamental basis for it to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: profoundly therapeutic molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also, you know, again, we don't
have any evidence to look at either the
[SPEAKER_00]: acute or the chronic effects for either
affective support or you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I will say and I,
you know, like I always lean on this
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's so true and I don't lean on
it in a negative way to downplay the power
[SPEAKER_00]: of pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clearly am a cannabis pharmacologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in these molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also equally believe in the power of
the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we know about all drugs,
any drug is the newer it is, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: profound the placebo effect is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your, you know, small test cases that
you do with your patients on Vashon,
[SPEAKER_00]: do they know what they're getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they know that it contains CBG?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they knew at the beginning of the
study that it was a new novel cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: called CBG, but they did not know what the
effects were supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, so I, I, and I certainly
didn't prime them for this anxiety stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I wasn't even looking for myself,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also think about, you know,
like what ails people generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a chronic pain patient,
it's both about that bodily sensation of
[SPEAKER_00]: pain as well as, you know, like we talked
about earlier, that affective component of
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, which is inseparable from the bodily
suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I, I, I approach this,
you know, from, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I really appreciate the evidence
and it wouldn't it be lovely if we could
[SPEAKER_00]: do, you know, double blind placebo
controlled crossover clinical trials with
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a matter of, as a matter of fact,
you know, Dr. Ethan Russo happens to live
[SPEAKER_02]: on the same island that I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually told him what I was doing
and I described it to him and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and, and he, he kind of raised his
eyebrow because he's, he's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's all like, well that he says,
you're using this term study.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, this isn't, this isn't really a
study, you know, you're just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: giving it to people and asking them
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, a study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, yeah, there,
there was no, there was no double blinded
[SPEAKER_02]: in this or pure reviewedness to this,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I totally understand, you know,
dosing protocols.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to recommend to people now,
which was the actual point for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to say that everything we
know about cannabis started from
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotes, you know, 20 years ago,
patients were coming into their doctor's
[SPEAKER_00]: offices and saying, Hey doc, when I smoke
a joint before bed, I don't need to use my
[SPEAKER_00]: diluted or, you know, like I've noticed
that since I started smoking cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I use half as many opioids and those
anecdotes all collected into community
[SPEAKER_00]: defined evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that community defined evidence grew
to a point where we were able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, do more closely controlled
experimental trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of this stuff has value,
heuristic value, if nothing else in that
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it allows us to go down a line of
questioning, well, huh, isn't that
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting that, you know, these chronic
pain patients who experience anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: have this, you know, what looks to be a
very profound therapeutic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we dig into that a little
deeper?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a ton of value in this,
you know, both from a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular molecular level, there's
rationale there and there's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: rationale to listen to the people when
what they're saying is real and it's worth
[SPEAKER_00]: looking into.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of my scientist friends,
when I talk with them, say we're at
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald cup or something and which,
which pulls cannabis researchers and
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists and doctors from all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get together, you know,
a lot of them talk a lot of trash about
[SPEAKER_02]: citizen scientists, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all like, yeah, we understand
what you're doing, but there doesn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of value to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I'm actually a big proponent for
citizen science that, that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's all work at home on our own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and especially since cannabis is
federally illegal and, and getting the
[SPEAKER_02]: research approved is so difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, let's start doing this research on
our own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as it becomes more commonplace in
the population, when legit research
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists go to divine their studies,
they're like, well, you know, I've heard
[SPEAKER_02]: this thing anecdotally, let's go ahead up
and, and fire up the funding machine and
[SPEAKER_02]: get the university to do this study.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that wouldn't have necessarily been
indicated without regular nobodies doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it on their own first for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other component to that is that,
you know, when we do clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a very long list of exclusion
criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to be pretty
neuro-typical and you have to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty narrow range of conditions and you
can't have abused drugs in the past and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't have this and you have to be
this and you have to be a certain age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very lengthy list of
exclusion criteria, which means that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: self selecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that drug might work in this
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you have, you know, developed a
rigorous exclusion criteria for,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it only works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about everybody else?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about all these other people who lie
all over the place on the neuro-typical
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum, you know, and who have all of
these other comorbidities and who have all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these, you know, traumatic childhoods,
you know, so that that's also a really
[SPEAKER_00]: great thing about, you know, a large but
messy data set is that if you do have an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, which is profound, you're going to
detect it in both populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if a drug really works,
it should work for everybody, no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: what their, you know, neuro-type or
background or underlying conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than, you know, some drug that only
works for this very, very narrowly
[SPEAKER_00]: defined, you know, like population of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hit on one other thing about,
you know, you mentioned that last summer
[SPEAKER_02]: was the first summer that Kenabajiral was
in commercial you know, acres and acres of
[SPEAKER_02]: it were grown with those Oregon CBD seeds
all over the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was very excited because while I got
my sample for these tests almost two years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago now, I was all like, all right,
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do this stuff now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end of the summer 2019,
there'll be all these whole plant oils
[SPEAKER_02]: coming to market and I can send people to
purchase them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll be like this new new arrow in
the quiver and I'll be damned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very disappointed to see that the
vast majority of the people who grew CBG,
[SPEAKER_02]: they ended up making single molecule
isolate out of it and using it to spike
[SPEAKER_02]: edibles and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you've mentioned several times
during this episode so far, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: these cannabinoids, especially the novel
ones are, they work their best in the
[SPEAKER_02]: present of other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like, you know, CBG grown in
volume at acres was extracted into isolate
[SPEAKER_02]: for the monetary value and ease of
integrating into products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet again, patients lose out because
what they really needed to do was turn all
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff into a whole plant,
full extract ethanol oil, put it in
[SPEAKER_02]: capsules and give it to people so that it
was actually effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like you're right, but you're also
like fighting economic, you're fighting
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial, you know, this, this is not
new for me or this show 80, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like commerce is and commerce does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, like what is best for the
patients is not necessarily the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but I am encouraged because you
know, this is, you know, one more frontier
[SPEAKER_00]: that we get to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what happens when we have that full
cannabis extract?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when we have it, you know,
in large doses and capsules?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if we, you know, can somehow
vaporize that flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't, I don't know a lot
about the phenotype of that flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a chance to encounter it
myself or even look at a certificate of
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, but you know, I could imagine
how it could potentially be at least right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and in this stage, a relatively low
yielding plant in terms of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the cannabinoid per gram?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so maybe that's the thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we need to get it, you know,
hybridized into these like really oil
[SPEAKER_00]: rich, you know, rather than just biomass
producing plants, these oil producing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, maybe that'll help, you know,
popularize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited because I do think that
this is a really interesting molecule and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a long way to go with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last thing before we go to commercial,
are there any other cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_02]: constituents of cannabis that you see
coming down the line that we should look
[SPEAKER_02]: out for, for dealing with pain?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's, there's, there's a slew
of cannabinoids, but there's almost no
[SPEAKER_02]: research on, on the vast majority of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but what, what do you, anything you
want to flag for us to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_02]: keep an eye out for the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there are two big ones and
you know, if you are a nerd for the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature like I am, they've been there
all along and it shouldn't be a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise, but they're, the evidence is
like profound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like beta-cariophylline is a full agonist
at the CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a cannabinoid per se,
but it is a cannabinoid in that it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: full agonist at a cannabinoid receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beta-cariophylline, you know,
is profoundly anti-inflammatory,
[SPEAKER_00]: has tons of therapeutic potential and it's
abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, you know, this one in
particular could be playing a really
[SPEAKER_00]: important role in pain relief,
especially because of the mechanisms of
[SPEAKER_00]: pain and inflammation in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at basal conditions, when you have a
normal healthy organism, the CB2 receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much of it around,
so much so that for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: even at the International Cannabinoid
Research Society, ICRS, that's the main
[SPEAKER_00]: professional scientific society.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cannabis and cannabinoid sphere,
ICRS, you know, still to this day,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little bit of debate about is
the CB2 receptor even present in the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because under normal
conditions, no, it's not, there's no need
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have chronic drug exposure,
chronic stress, chronic inflammation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, any kind of insults to the
organism, these things bloom like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expression of the CB2 receptor goes up,
you know, under any kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: insult or injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so particularly in those conditions,
if you have all those receptors sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: around waiting for their, you know,
little key to come float in and activate
[SPEAKER_00]: it, maybe beta-karyophylline could be a
good, you know, component to introduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a particularly sexy one
because it's everywhere, but it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, you know, it has a lot of promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one that there's some
preclinical evidence for is
[SPEAKER_00]: tetrahydrocannabdivarin, THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one, especially in combination
with other cannabinoids does look like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a large amount of promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a few years behind
cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely don't know anyone who's,
you know, trying to cultivate THCV
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant plants, but certainly there's
some like semi-synthetic folks out there
[SPEAKER_00]: working with yeast who are trying to
produce this, you know, at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think THCV has a lot of promise as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think, and again, this one's like
not super sexy because it's so obvious,
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the acid form, the
non-decarboxylated version of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing's profoundly anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it goes back to that sort of
micronutrient territory where if you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, low but consistent ingestion or
somehow, you know, putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-intoxicating THC into your body,
and supporting the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that way as from a micronutrient
perspective, that also has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are tons of patient
stories out there of people who have been,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, preparing their own
non-intoxicating sort of cannabinoid rich,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hemp seed elixirs for many
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it seems to be at least
anecdotally that, you know, that has
[SPEAKER_00]: worked for them to manage, you know,
chronic diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, those are some of the big ones,
you know, the acid form of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: the non-decarboxylated form,
beta-cariofilin, and THCB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Adi.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go ahead and take that last
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacologist, Adi Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-rolls have come a long way since the
early days of normalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you choose Saint's Joints,
you are smoking all-flour, top-shelf
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-rolls with terpenes that will sculpt
your high in a way that dry, old pre-rolls
[SPEAKER_02]: just can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas most brands release pre-rolls as
an afterthought, for the last five years,
[SPEAKER_02]: Saint's Joints has focused on their line
of exotic, curated joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while some companies just chase the
hype strains, Saint's Joints goes deeper,
[SPEAKER_02]: searching out hard-to-find strains,
unexpected crosses, and nearly-forgotten
[SPEAKER_02]: land races and classics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some hype ones, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only does a joint from Saint's smoke
incredibly well, they have fine-tuned
[SPEAKER_02]: every step of the process so you don't get
runs in the paper, the joint is just the
[SPEAKER_02]: right density to have a nice pull,
and the joint stays lit, even if you get a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit chatty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saint's Joints boxes are works of art and
will spark conversation when you pull them
[SPEAKER_02]: out at a party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saint's award-winning boxes change with
every release, feature edgy outsider art,
[SPEAKER_02]: and often raise awareness of important
issues like equal rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saint's boxes are so desired that many
collect them and display them in their
[SPEAKER_02]: homes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask your budtender for Saint's Joints and
have a premium joint experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you are a licensed cannabis
cultivator, I have an extra message for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saint's is looking for partners in legal
cannabis states to expand the availability
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Saint's Joints brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you grow exceptional cannabis flower
but are less excited about all the effort,
[SPEAKER_02]: cost, and risk of launching your own
brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Saint's Joints may be just the partner you
are looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Already established in California,
Washington, and Oklahoma, and recognized
[SPEAKER_02]: by Entrepreneur Magazine and Green
Entrepreneur as a cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: leader, the Saint's Joints brand will set
you up a part in your home market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best thing I can recommend is for you
to visit their Instagram at Saint's Joints
[SPEAKER_02]: and look at their patented drawer design
boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Become that brand everyone is talking
about without having to build it from
[SPEAKER_02]: scratch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out the Instagram at Saint's Joints
and then visit saintsjoints.com to find
[SPEAKER_02]: out more.
[SPEAKER_02]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking to home growers, patients,
and commercial growers, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI Seeds at
[SPEAKER_02]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caleb Inspector and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_02]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of his lineage and the hard-earned
experience that comes from growing up
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long-time heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_02]: yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caleb, also known as Inspector,
and Pirates of the Emerald Triangle,
[SPEAKER_02]: is a breeder's breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_02]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not experimental feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year here on Vashon Island,
[SPEAKER_02]: and everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_02]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_02]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_02]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines, along with
[SPEAKER_02]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know that Shaping Fire has a
fabulous YouTube channel with content not
[SPEAKER_02]: found on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I attend conventions or speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_02]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Kevin
[SPEAKER_02]: Jodry of Wonderland Nursery talking about
breeding cannabis for the best terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profile, Nicholas Mahmood on regenerative
and polyculture cannabis growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history of
cannabis medicine around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ben Cassidy of True Terpenes on using
terpenes for health in your everyday life,
[SPEAKER_02]: Reggie Gaudino of Steep Hill on the
cannabis genome, and Jeff Lowenfels on the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system, and even my own
presentation on how to approach finding
[SPEAKER_02]: your dream job in cannabis and why we
choose cannabis business even though the
[SPEAKER_02]: risks are so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: As of today, there are over 100 videos
that you can check out for absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to youtube.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on the link in this week's
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is cannabis pharmacologist,
[SPEAKER_02]: Ady Rae.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are in the third set and we
want to go through dosing and methods of
[SPEAKER_02]: taking in your cannabinoids because now
that you perhaps have these ideas that you
[SPEAKER_02]: might want to replace your opiates with
cannabis, one of the hardest things is
[SPEAKER_02]: figuring out what the hell to do next.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go through a couple of
the different common methods for ingesting
[SPEAKER_02]: or taking in cannabinoids and we'll kind
of riff on each of those so that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: all kind of learn together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ady, I know from watching your other
presentations that you are not
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly a fan of smoking,
I mean, for medicinal, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We all love to smoke, but actually as far
as it being medicinally effective,
[SPEAKER_02]: would you explain why that's what you
teach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, the basis for that is purely
from polyaromatic hydrocarbons,
[SPEAKER_00]: from things that are potential
carcinogens, putting burnt plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of your body is less healthy than
not putting burnt plant material inside
[SPEAKER_00]: your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that being said, I've always been
a firm believer that the best kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine is the one you will take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if smoking cannabis feels like medicine
to you and it is the path of least
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to getting medicine into your
body, then you're better off with the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine than without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of people, smoking simply
doesn't feel like medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never part of their culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some fear and shame and there's a
lot of war on drugs stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There and smoking simply is not going to
work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits of smoking are really the
benefits of inhalation, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: immediate onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you have an activated molecule and
Delta 9 THC in particular has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be converted from its acid
inactive form to its, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylated active form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THCA has to be converted into THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do that, you have to apply heat and
the easiest way for thousands of years to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply heat to the cannabis plant is to set
it on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefit of smoking is that you have
an activated THC, which goes directly into
[SPEAKER_00]: your freshly oxygenated blood supply,
which goes directly up to your brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is exactly why it has an immediate
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for someone who is experiencing for
instance, breakthrough cancer pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing is going to help better than to
have an immediate relief of that pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that can, you know,
literally instantaneously shut off the
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if smoking does that for you,
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other ways of inhaling the
cannabinoids that don't involve,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the burnt plant material that,
you know, can potentially cause other
[SPEAKER_00]: health effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say other health effects,
you know, there are known side effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we have yet to see any,
you know, sort of cancer or lung cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of chronically smoking cannabis,
like we see with, you know, chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco smoking clearly causes cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gnarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we do see are, you know,
COPD, chronic inflammatory, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see, you know, coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see phlegm production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not to say that smoking is totally
unsafe, but it's also not totally safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still other ways of reaping the
benefits of inhaled cannabinoids without
[SPEAKER_00]: exposing yourselves to all of those,
the toxins and the irritants that lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those other, you know, inflammatory
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go ahead and add to that too,
that for a lot of people, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: your example of cancer related pain and
the immediate succession of pain is spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet there are a lot of patients who
are taking either THC for other types of
[SPEAKER_02]: pain, or maybe they're looking for CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where smoking it has that very fast
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fills your lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's instantly in your brain and you go up
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not necessarily what everybody who
is fighting, say for example, inflammatory
[SPEAKER_02]: pain is looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking say a tincture or something,
or a topical where the cannabinoids enter
[SPEAKER_02]: the body at a slower rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of going up and getting this
peak and then slowly coming down,
[SPEAKER_02]: you instead have this slow pathway up and
then the slow pathway down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll tend to, you know, last for longer
and allow you to be more productive,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because so many pain patients they still
have got to go to work and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: titrate or control your dosage when you're
smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people are like, oh, I'm going to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're like, shit, now I can't
go to work because I'm fricking baked,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for those folks, they should
definitely be aware that in addition to
[SPEAKER_02]: not scorching your lungs, you know,
some of these other options that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to talk about may be better for you
because they are going to be less
[SPEAKER_02]: intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that for all of these methods
of administration, there are really three
[SPEAKER_00]: major components that we can talk about,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're managing impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also talking about the onset of the
effect, how quickly it works, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: the duration of the effect, how long it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, one other element of,
you know, pain relief is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of chronic pain patients have a lot
of trouble sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a different difficulty falling
asleep because they're in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have difficulty staying asleep
because their pain wakes them up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just from a sleep management
perspective, smoking is probably not the
[SPEAKER_00]: best idea because the peak, the onset
might be, you know, almost immediate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the duration of that effect is really
not very much, you know, two to three
[SPEAKER_00]: hours if you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really do for something like,
you know, where you need a long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, you know, something that's going
to get you through a good six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking isn't going to be the best for you
because you need something with a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: duration.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just as a little side note,
one of these days, somebody is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out a good way to do time released,
whole plant capsules, and they're just
[SPEAKER_02]: going to crush the market because,
you know, I mean, some people use,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, enteric capsules, which help a
little bit, but most of the time to make
[SPEAKER_02]: something time released, you have to over
process to the point that it's not whole
[SPEAKER_02]: plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your description is right on point
because so many pain patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: they will take whatever cannabis they're
going to take in the evening and then by,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 2, 2.30 in the morning,
their pain is waking them back up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they have to have strategies to
have a second dose on their nightstand,
[SPEAKER_02]: which then occasionally in some people
with some cultivars make them feel a
[SPEAKER_02]: little groggy in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point or worse or worse,
sometimes too, it can cause tachycardia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what I mean by that is a
racing heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ironically, you're trying to go to
sleep and yet you, you know, inadvertently
[SPEAKER_00]: consume a little bit too much THC causes
this like sympathetic nervous system
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction where your brain interprets,
you know, a fast paced heartbeat as
[SPEAKER_00]: paranoia and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I guess it's worthwhile to point
out, at least, at least my understanding
[SPEAKER_02]: is that the tachycardia is actually most
likely attributed to a particular terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: in the plant and not THC directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you use cannabis and you do get
the racing heart, which is something that
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate, there are, you need to try enough
to find out what the terpene is for you in
[SPEAKER_02]: those plants and then, and then avoid
those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say that this is kind of the
cutting edge of understanding,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, using whole flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, there's not a lot of research
on it, but I think there will be soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that, you know,
the, the patients who use dronabinol,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the synthetic form of THC,
you know, they, they also experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that there probably is some
interaction between, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like all of our cannabinoids and
terpenes, there's, you know, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly something going on there where you
know, you've got to, for, for any product
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're using and ingesting it by any
means, you've got to find that personal
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic window, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to take enough of the stuff to
get your good effect without taking so
[SPEAKER_00]: much that you get a bad effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've already talked quite a bit
about tincture, but let's talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a lot of people like
tincture is because they feel much more in
[SPEAKER_02]: control, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: With, with smoking, you know, it's really
hard to control how much you're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: going to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with, you know, things like capsules,
you're kind of beholden to whatever they
[SPEAKER_02]: put in the capsule.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with tinctures, this is very much
individualized medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're able to say, okay, you know,
this, this lab tested tincture,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the potency of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to slowly increase my,
my dosage over the next few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to find my sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I know it's going to be,
you know, X amount of a dropper or X
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of, you know, drops themselves so
that you can get repeatable results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, that's why I generally
recommend tinctures for people because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the patient control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love tinctures for several
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is that, you know,
like you said, it does feel like medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: to people, you know, like for a lot of
people, my grandparents age, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky enough that my grandmother is
still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like there's absolutely no
way, like she would even use something
[SPEAKER_00]: that looked like a inhaler to inhale
cannabinoids, but a tincture like that
[SPEAKER_00]: feels like medicine to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she'll actually use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you can't benefit from a
medicine that you are opposed to using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that component, the easily
titratable, easily dosable, reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I like about some of
these tinctures is that they're that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, depending on the formulation,
it can act as somewhat of a hybrid between
[SPEAKER_00]: a product that's available both
immediately in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you swallow some of it and it does
get all the way through the liver,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you have, you know, like a two for
one, where you have the immediate onset,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from some of the THC to,
you know, produce some sedation,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas you have that sort of slow release
effect from the liver and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, converting Delta 9 into other
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives you this more prolonged slow
release effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have both immediate onset and a
long duration, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: really not achievable through any other
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I find very
liberating about tinctures is that even
[SPEAKER_02]: though there are certainly, you know,
artisan and craft ways to make a good
[SPEAKER_02]: ethanol tincture, that is going to be
potentially better than, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a novice tincture maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the fact that it is a process
that's available to everyone, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can grow their own cannabis plants
in their yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can take the flower and they can
pour, you know, everclear ethanol over the
[SPEAKER_02]: top, you know, shake it for 90 seconds,
strain it through a coffee filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just made your own tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure, there's, there's, you know,
there's fancier ways to go about it by
[SPEAKER_02]: like freezing everything first and all
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But essentially, if you just pour ethanol
over your flower and strain it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have made tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on what state you live in,
many, many state cannabis labs will,
[SPEAKER_02]: will allow patients to get things tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can find out how strong what
you made is as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that kind of,
I don't know, I guess I'll call it
[SPEAKER_02]: egalitarian pharmacology is something
that's, it's very attractive to me because
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not support the ivory tower medicine
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess we already established
that with the whole citizen scientist
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, but tinctures are great because you
can have control of your own health by
[SPEAKER_02]: growing your own plant, making your own
tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and now you are self-sufficient and
it's wildly less expensive than purchasing
[SPEAKER_02]: it either licensed or unlicensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, and I, the word that I use for this is
empowerment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, it's,
it's beyond just the not being reliant
[SPEAKER_00]: upon someone else, but there's like,
when you see a project through from
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning to end, and I see this with my
trainees and my students all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have investment in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you, you know, pop that seed,
when you drop that clone in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you are tending to that plant,
when you are you know, looking for signs
[SPEAKER_00]: of maturity, when you are harvesting it
with your own hands, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a lot invested in yourself and
all of those, you know, that, that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: process is supportive of your health,
you know, like that is you taking your own
[SPEAKER_00]: health into your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we see this all the time in
the pain clinic, you know, those people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are able to, you know, take control of
their own lives and decide I am going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do this for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those aren't the people we see in the pain
clinic, because they don't have any pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have figured it out for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like this, this,
this, you know, being invested in it has
[SPEAKER_00]: has sort of a holistic support,
you know, from a human level, in addition
[SPEAKER_00]: to you also as a byproduct are not reliant
upon some, you know, like commerce or
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical company or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I love that idea of this
pharmaceutical egalitarianism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's talk about edibles,
because a lot of people use edibles and
[SPEAKER_02]: swear by them for their pain, and pretty
much, you know, will express that they
[SPEAKER_02]: can't live without them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But edibles are, are a complex medicine,
and they've got pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so let's start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your general impressions of the
efficacy of edibles?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and when you do recommend edibles,
what do you recommend people try?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so let's start with the pros.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, we have something that's
really easily dosable, just like we have
[SPEAKER_00]: with tinctures, you know, it's pretty
easy, even if you have something that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, more than the dose that you
would prefer, it can often be really easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to divide that dose, you know,
I am not a five milligram gummy person,
[SPEAKER_00]: like two and a half is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that that's the benefit is
that you have something that is easily
[SPEAKER_00]: dosable, which means that a patient knows
what to expect, there's some consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: in that effect, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that about edibles is that it's
easy to dose and easy to divide doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I really like is the
duration, you know, because we're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids through the liver,
you are, you know, recruiting the liver to
[SPEAKER_00]: prolong the effects of the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often that can be extremely
therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to get all the way through a
workday, if you've got to get all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through a night of sleep, you need a slow
release formula, you know, something that
[SPEAKER_00]: wears off in two to three hours is not
going to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like it for the ability to dose and
the ability to last for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I could see why patients would
totally swear by that, because those are
[SPEAKER_00]: really important components of medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, we talked about
earlier about the smoking, while certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: the the power of edibles is not to be
scoffed at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice because you don't go up as fast
as you do with smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're looking for pain relief
and the anti inflammation without the
[SPEAKER_02]: stony aspect of it, edibles can often be a
good choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can as long as you stay within your
own therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we talked briefly about that
before how you've got to take enough of it
[SPEAKER_00]: to feel something, but you can't take so
much that you start to experience negative
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, with edibles,
the likelihood of experiencing a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, it can be pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the data that came out of
Colorado, you know, when legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: first came around, we saw that the vast
majority of people who came into the
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency departments after ingesting
cannabis, you know, they're having an
[SPEAKER_00]: acute psychotic episode or they think
they're going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some kind of THC overdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of those cases are
edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason for that is that
when you ingest cannabis, Delta 9 is
[SPEAKER_00]: converted, you know, Delta 9 THC is
converted into 11 hydroxy THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is far more potent and it lasts for
a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, inhaling five milligrams of
THC is not at all the same thing as
[SPEAKER_00]: swallowing five milligrams of THC because
your liver converts it into something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's more powerful and lasts longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing about the liver is that,
you know, everyone's liver is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the different effects of edibles
say far more about the differences in our
[SPEAKER_00]: livers than they do about the difference
in manufacturing processes or the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in the products themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the enzymes within our liver
that, you know, metabolize drugs and dump
[SPEAKER_00]: things into our bloodstream and protect us
from toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those enzymes are proteins and
those proteins are encoded by our DNA and
[SPEAKER_00]: our DNA is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, drug metabolism is affected by
other drugs that you're taking,
[SPEAKER_00]: other medications that you're taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affected by your diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affected by your exercise and your
other lifestyle components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for all of those reasons,
you know, the effects of an edible are not
[SPEAKER_00]: only, you know, variable between people,
but also variable within one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, although, yes, it might be really easy
to dose and it might last a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's also some degree of risk there
because you're allowing your liver to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a very potent molecule and you
could experience different effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from day to day because of the
other, you know, sort of lifestyle
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is such a challenge for pain
patients who are new to cannabis because
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what we're kind of teasing apart
is actually a really complex situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the patient wants the cannabinoids
and so they take an edible because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: approachable and they're pretty easy to
get in legal states anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if you take it and you take too
much, your, we'll call it over-medicated
[SPEAKER_02]: self, not only is it way more intense
because it's become 11 hydroxy,
[SPEAKER_02]: but because your body is processing it
more slowly, your bad experience lasts
[SPEAKER_02]: longer too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you smoke too much pot,
it's like, oh, all right, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm gonna go and sit in nature
and I'll be pretty good in about 45
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's gonna go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while you know it's gonna go away with
an edible too, that could easily be two
[SPEAKER_02]: and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easily, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that will often scare people away
from cannabis medicine when it really had
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing to do with the inherent value of
cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had to do with using edibles properly
for pain takes some pre-education and then
[SPEAKER_02]: an awareness to start at a low amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this adage, the start low and go slow
applies absolutely the most to any product
[SPEAKER_00]: that is ingested, swallowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it is incredibly important
to start, you know, really, really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're working with our chronic
pain patients in Philadelphia,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a collaboration with Thomas
Jefferson University and the Rothman
[SPEAKER_00]: Orthopedic Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're working with our chronic pain
patients, you know, we're advising them if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna use an edible product,
a swallowed product to start at one
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram of THC because they're there
really are some individuals out there who
[SPEAKER_00]: are hypersensitive to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people can tolerate an entire 100
milligram edible, you know, to themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other people, you know, spin out into,
you know, total paranoia and psychosis at
[SPEAKER_00]: one milligram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's far more conservative
and it's, you know, better to not take
[SPEAKER_00]: enough than it is to take too much because
you can always take more but you can never
[SPEAKER_00]: take less, especially with an edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, while we're talking about
liberation medicine, let's talk about ego
[SPEAKER_02]: and being cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure I point out to
patients that there's a certain vibe
[SPEAKER_02]: within the cannabis scene that taking more
THC is cool and if you take less,
[SPEAKER_02]: you are somehow less than or a wuss or,
you know, have got baby lungs or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's a lot of different ways
that people with high tolerances can kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of diss people who take a small amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to encourage folks to,
you know, if taking 2.5 milligrams of THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: which most people don't feel it at 2.5
milligrams, it's a nice steady,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, three times a day
anti-inflammatory dose, but you don't get
[SPEAKER_02]: intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll mention sometimes, you know,
2.5 milligrams and someone in the group
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking with will totally scoff and
they're like, oh, I take, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 milligrams, you know, six times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I'm glad that you found
something that worked for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there are a lot of people,
myself included, if I took 25 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I'm going to have a bad day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my, you know, I'm going to,
you know, I don't know if I can call it so
[SPEAKER_02]: far as psychosis, but I need to go lay
down and I'm going to be scared for a few
[SPEAKER_02]: hours and I hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, like, you know, individualized
medicine is very modern and it's important
[SPEAKER_02]: for pain patients to remember that you
need to start low and you need to increase
[SPEAKER_02]: it slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And comparing your dosage to anybody else
should not matter at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got different number of,
you know, cannabinoid receivers in your
[SPEAKER_02]: body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your body is going to process it at a
different rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There really is not, you know,
any kind of hard and fast comparisons,
[SPEAKER_02]: patients to patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be able to get guidance from
other patients, but understand that
[SPEAKER_02]: guidance and then start at one milligram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that you're bringing this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, at least for my patients
that I'm working with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we are seeing a whole lot of people
that are entirely cannabis naive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily, you know, they're not bringing
that kind of thinking or that kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: for lack of a better word, machismo to the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's entirely novel for them and
they're just looking to their doctors for
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, fortunately, you know,
we can start working with people with all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those factors that you mentioned,
you know, your individual experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beautiful thing about this plant
is that it is dynamic enough that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: something for pretty much everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the idea of we're all unified
in our process, but not necessarily in our
[SPEAKER_00]: dose or our amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our process is always the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start somewhere and we either have a
good time and we can keep going or we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a bad time and we have to back off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the magnitude at which we increase or
the magnitude at which we decrease our
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption or our frequency may vary but
that's the process, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that we don't talk
about in, you know, all of the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: allopathic medicine very much,
you know, that this is true for lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: other drugs that people go to their
doctors for, you know, like some people go
[SPEAKER_00]: for anxiety medication or a tricyclic
antidepressant and the doctor tries you on
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing and it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you switch to a different drug and then
you have to up the dose and then it was
[SPEAKER_00]: too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you back down the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the difference between allopathic
pharmaceuticals and cannabis is that
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of your doctor telling you,
you're having a bad time, let's do
[SPEAKER_00]: something different, you have to pay
attention to yourself and look at your
[SPEAKER_00]: journal and say, that didn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to do something different,
which for some people can be incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: empowering and it can make all the
difference in the world in their health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for other people who are really
accustomed to having their hands,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, truly held by a healthcare
professional, and putting all of their
[SPEAKER_00]: trust and getting all 100% of their
guidance about their health from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a person in a white coat,
that can be really intimidating to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: say like, oh, geez, I have to like figure
out all of this stuff by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this is really overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel for that person, it is
absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is work to try and find a place to
start and then, you know, fine tune your
[SPEAKER_00]: own process in accordance to your own body
and your own lifestyle needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be a process, but it can also be
an incredibly rewarding process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bully for anybody in the audience
who's new to cannabis, who's trying to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, transition from opioids to
cannabis, who is saying, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get a good education first,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's sad how much of the licensed
market cannabis packaging and marketing is
[SPEAKER_02]: intended to confuse the buyer of what it
actually is, maybe trying to sound like a
[SPEAKER_02]: product of higher quality than it is,
or making claims that are untrue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you take your health into your
own hands and you do your research in
[SPEAKER_02]: advance, you are really doing yourself a
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be hard, you know, like it's very
difficult to know who to trust,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like this is on the label that
it relieves pain and that it improves
[SPEAKER_00]: cognition or whatever it is, whatever it's
on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was formulated by a PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore it's a good product,
you know, like that, all of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: can be kind of deceiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I, I do feel for people who are,
you know, just embarking on this journey
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is a lot of homework and it is
a lot of time that not a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, have the luxury of navigating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard you use the term science
washing before, and I, and I got a chuckle
[SPEAKER_02]: out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're comparing it to like green
washing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that are, are faking being
environmental, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so much, like there's so many
cannabis products that are faking having a
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific basis to them, not cannabis
itself, which has a scientific basis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that particular method may not like be
in line with the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you have a vaporizer pen that has,
you know, sleep in its, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: branding or, or its effects, you know,
like I think that your listeners are,
[SPEAKER_00]: would benefit from, you know, applying
some scientific thinking to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how do you know that it's good
for sleep?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you get your information?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people tried it for?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people did it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like how, where did the formula
come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like I, I love the idea of
everyone being a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: skeptical, you know, and, and especially
when it comes to this kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we, we have been relying on the
pharmaceutical industry to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we trusted them to provide us with safe
medicine for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't happen, you know,
like we were extremely misled by the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical industry when it came to
the opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it would behoove all of us to
think a little bit more critically and
[SPEAKER_00]: skeptically about, you know, any kind of
claim that appears on some packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I realized we've kind of set ourselves
up, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we've just spent this show
recommending that people try cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we just said, you know,
the market is full of lies and you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: trust what's on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the damn thing is, is that they're
both true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and the best thing that I recommend
to people is, you know, do your research
[SPEAKER_02]: on, on, on, you know, the dosing protocol
that you want to do for yourself,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then do some research beyond just
talking to a bud tender on the product
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're going to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then also, you know, humans have been
using cannabis and, you know, smoking it
[SPEAKER_02]: and making cannabis tinctures for,
for thousands and thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new cool, hot, fancy thing is not
necessarily better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're just starting out and you
don't have a very good bullshit detector
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to cannabis products,
I would always recommend to start with
[SPEAKER_02]: something that is more simple than more
fancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everybody was all excited when
water soluble CBD became available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, oh, we can put in all
these beverages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what use does water soluble
isolate have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't think it's healthy to take
isolate and you have to over process it
[SPEAKER_02]: even more to make it water soluble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so, you know, maybe, maybe that
makes me, you know, less cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly got rid of any soda
advertisers I would have gotten on the
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that sometimes it's,
it's, you know, better if you stick with
[SPEAKER_02]: the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I, many times before I have
said that, you know, we did phase one
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials on cannabis 5,000 years
ago in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safe for most people, you know,
and now the question is, is it effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that we have a lot of
evidence to demonstrate that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is both a safe and effective pain
reliever for most people with chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't say that about opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know that it does work for some
people, you know, a very small proportion
[SPEAKER_00]: of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works over the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who have been on,
you know, opioids for decades and it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's effective for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's far the risk of, you know,
physical dependence and the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: overdose and the risk of, you know,
constipation, cognitive impairment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's greater than the, you know,
pain relief that results from engaging
[SPEAKER_00]: with opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where these two start to interact is
largely at a point where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: patients often get to a point where their
opioids are becoming more difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: obtain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a person who's
physically dependent upon an opioid,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're kind of stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need something to be introduced into
their body to feel normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people have been using
cannabis in combination with their
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids, especially initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my work in academia has
been supporting this approach for a very
[SPEAKER_00]: long time because we know, you know,
at a very fundamental mammalian level,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you have these compounds in your body
at the same time, they produce synergistic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a greater than additive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2 plus 2 equals 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have something like that,
when you have a 7 instead of a 4,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can back off on the doses of each
of those components so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve the same level of pain relief you
had before at a much smaller dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything, anything we can do to reduce the
dose of an opioid required to elicit pain
[SPEAKER_00]: relief, that is a really good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, nothing, no other,
no single other drug, no other law,
[SPEAKER_00]: no prescription drug monitoring program,
no abuse deterrent formulation of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical, no other intervention has
reduced the number of opioid overdose
[SPEAKER_00]: deaths as much as legalizing cannabis has
reduced opioid deaths.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're about to go into the
how-to of actually doing the transition
[SPEAKER_02]: because I know you've given this a lot of
thought, but before we go there,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's one more thing I want to hit on
the, on the edibles tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is, you and I mentioned in
passing that, that, you know, many folks,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just stop at 2.5 milligrams because
that gets, that takes care of their pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe if they want to feel like a
little jocular with it, they'll go up to 5
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're getting some of the other
attributes of pain relief as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you've got these people who have
got long-term chronic pain and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking a hundred milligram brownies and,
and they're both pain patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like I know there's several
different variables at play.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just toss it to you like that and
say like, what's up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the, one of the fundamental
things there is tolerance, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, both a tool and a hindrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to reap the benefits of THC
and cannabis, you, you do have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: some degree of tolerance so that you can
widen your own personal therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can widen the dose range at which you
feel something, but you, you, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: still fall below the threshold of feeling
bad things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So staying in that therapeutic window is
easier if you have some tolerance to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's more tolerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a wider window of good effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem comes in and, and this is
something that, you know, we would be wise
[SPEAKER_00]: not to repeat with the opioids,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: With, with opioids, no, no doctor ever
told their patient, Hey, this stuff can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce physical dependence to manage your
physical dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should monitor your tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find yourself taking more or more
frequently, take a break, switch to
[SPEAKER_00]: something else for a couple of days,
allow your body to reset and come back to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could have saved thousands of
people's lives, but we never had that
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with our opioid consuming
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one thing that we can,
we have the opportunity to do right with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have that exact conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a substance that you can develop
physical dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could develop some kind of cannabis
use disorder or hyperemesis or some other
[SPEAKER_00]: dysregulation in your endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's prudent to take a break from time to
time, not only to allow your body to
[SPEAKER_00]: resensitize, but if you are able to take
those periodic tolerance breaks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're able to resensitize to a point
where you don't need a hundred milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to feel that effect that you felt
on Friday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it is a far more economical
approach to take tolerance breaks,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the amount that is required to
elicit that same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: For pain patients who have pain every day
and who have transitioned to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you tell them to do on those
tolerance break days?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, so many of the pain
patients I talk to, the idea of taking a
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerance break and experiencing 48 hours
of their pain straight just makes them cry
[SPEAKER_02]: and they want to avoid that at all costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, like to be quite frank,
I don't tell them anything because people
[SPEAKER_00]: are very resourceful in figuring out
what's going to work best for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, you know, turn to other
kinds of pain therapies,
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatories, you know,
the non-steroidal ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of them might take an
opioid for a couple of days because I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, like the risk with opioids is over
the long term where they increase risk and
[SPEAKER_00]: where they lose their efficacy is when you
take them chronically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're only taking, you know,
opioids for two days, that's exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were designed for, short term use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them switch back to opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, you know, just, you know,
rely on meditation and cognitive sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, in fact, digital health
technologies and apps that people can
[SPEAKER_00]: download to, you know, sort of go through
practices daily to cognitively manage
[SPEAKER_00]: their pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, fortunately I don't need to
have those conversations frankly at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people are very resourceful in
figuring out how can I just get through a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of days?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's different for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes me sad when they don't want
to go back to the opiate because maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: they had a challenge with it before and
then they are on cannabis and they know
[SPEAKER_02]: they need to take the break.
[SPEAKER_02]: So either A, they resist taking a
tolerance break because they are afraid of
[SPEAKER_02]: those days off or as I see so common,
they just turn to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're sloshed for two days and
then they come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wish there were more options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is going to be,
you know, I would hope that as this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, chronic pain management with
cannabis becomes more mainstream,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we will have more of our best and
brightest minds in clinical practice and
[SPEAKER_00]: in scientific development that we will
have some answers for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get down to the brass tacks of
actually transitioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, going cold turkey on opioids
can be not only difficult, but dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are definitely advantages of
doing kind of like a measured transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know you've developed this out in
detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you tell us your
recommendations, Adi, for the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: transition time, the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is very different for
every patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just because you're on an opioid
doesn't mean that you're on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: opioid as anyone else who is going to the
same pain clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are short acting opioid drugs and
longer acting opioid drugs, which all have
[SPEAKER_00]: their different profiles in terms of how
rapidly you can taper off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is where the personalized
component is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've been attempting to develop
a formal opioid tapering protocol for a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we make some observations,
one of which is if we tell a patient
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely nothing by the three month
mark, they have just sort of figured out
[SPEAKER_00]: how to take half as many opioids or get
off of them entirely on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this kind of comes back to the
self empowering component where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people are perfectly capable of
figuring things out for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like if if you need some
strategies specifically for doing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we found is that a lot of patients
just start by eliminating one of their
[SPEAKER_00]: daily doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a really common one that people
eliminate is the one right before bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they switch to some kind of ingested
or swallowed preparation of cannabis right
[SPEAKER_00]: before bed, they no longer need their
overnight dose of their opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably the most common one to
skip the dose of the opioid that's taken
[SPEAKER_00]: right before bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then often a lot of patients wake up
feeling refreshed, having slept through
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without having that heavy sort of sedation
and the almost the hangover from the
[SPEAKER_00]: heavier narcotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just that cognitive state alone is
able to get them through the day so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're able to walk beside their pain
and, you know, live in the presence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pain rather than trying to totally numb it
with their next dose of their opioid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my practical ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would also, you know,
again advocate for the personalized
[SPEAKER_00]: component, which is do what is right for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of patients will do just
fine on, you know, like one or two doses
[SPEAKER_00]: of their opioid every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people can, you know,
decide that they don't want to be reliant
[SPEAKER_00]: on this anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're willing to, you know,
have a little bit, you know, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about cannabis is that it doesn't
profoundly eliminate the pain the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: an opioid does, but it certainly
profoundly improves the quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for some people, the physical sensation
of the pain is so intense that they just
[SPEAKER_00]: can't ever get away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always going to be consuming an
opioids and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what your body needs in order
for you to have a high quality of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: then shoot for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really what it boils down to is
figuring out what your own personal
[SPEAKER_00]: priorities are and utilizing cannabis in
combination with and eventually you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for some people potentially in
substitution for the opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that patients who are going
through that transition, they really need
[SPEAKER_02]: to, they really could, should,
I'm doing need and should, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, these are not good words.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is described to me often by patients
that they think it's going to be worse
[SPEAKER_02]: than it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that the transition becomes easier for
even very simple things like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: part of, part of taking Delta 9 THC is it
can cause, you know, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: cascading forgetfulness.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kind of thing where we joke as
cannabis people like, oh, forgot where my
[SPEAKER_02]: car keys were, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just basic stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many patients, they're so used to
taking their opioids on a schedule and
[SPEAKER_02]: that if they aren't on their schedule,
they're afraid that their pain will flare
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they start incorporating cannabis
alongside the opioids and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: the pain relief kicks in that's natural,
but also a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_02]: forgetfulness comes involved as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually forget that they're in
pain or they forget to take their dose and
[SPEAKER_02]: they realized, oh my gosh, you know,
I've naturally started replacing the
[SPEAKER_02]: opioids just because of the nature of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's been reflected in some
of our anecdotes that we hear in the
[SPEAKER_00]: clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and again, like this,
this is like to each their own,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for, for a lot of our patients,
you know, more than half of our patients
[SPEAKER_00]: don't experience any impairment
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those that do experience some
impairment, they, it either doesn't affect
[SPEAKER_00]: their day or they're more willing to deal
with the impairment than they are to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with their opioid side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is all fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adi, thank you so much for taking your
time to, well, actually a lot more time
[SPEAKER_02]: than we had, we had planned on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually got on a roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a lot of really great
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but thank you so much for sharing,
you know, the caring that you have for
[SPEAKER_02]: patients and your in-depth scientific
research, because I think that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there, there's so much in our
scene, which is, you know, anecdotal
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence and people sharing only what
worked for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a whole bunch of kind of like
myth and taboo leftover from from the
[SPEAKER_02]: reefer madness days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, you know, people like
you doing the real research and then,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, interacting with patients and
then coming out and sharing the reality of
[SPEAKER_02]: what they can do to save themselves is
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's an honor and a privilege to do
this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel very strongly about sharing the
work as widely as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for the opportunity
to share it with your audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to find out more about Adi,
there's a couple different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I recommend that if you like
the kind of information we talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: today and you would like to hear it with
pictures, I recommend that you go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube channel for Cultivation Classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a, it's a fantastic event in the
Portland area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the Cultivation Classic YouTube
channel, there is a recording of Adi's
[SPEAKER_02]: 2017 presentation on Beyond Opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you'll hear a lot of the stuff that
you learned today over again, but there's
[SPEAKER_02]: also a bunch of stuff she covered there
that we did not cover and it's got
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Adi did a great talk at the Cato
Institute on harm reduction for opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can find that on the Cato
Institute website at Cato.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's C-A-T-O dot O-R-G.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, if you want to reach out
to Adi Rae herself or find more about,
[SPEAKER_02]: find out more about her work and her
company, you can go to smartcannabis.life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be www.smartcannabis.life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can reach out if you want to,
or just learn more.
