[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there friends shango from shaping fire
here and I'm here to tell you about the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hindi mentality of Michael Hinden So
Michael's Hindi mentality was made up of
[SPEAKER_00]: four parts as I saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was clean information
Michael had the cleanest information in an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry full of bro science like cannabis
was Michael's the guy who went and found
[SPEAKER_00]: the original research, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter if it was like talking
about like, you know cannabis breeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: or botany in general or you know dog
breeds or You know some kind of technology
[SPEAKER_00]: or gotta help you engineering or the
planets or anything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that once you start talking to
Michael about any topic you could end up
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere else It was always an adventure
talking with him, but he always had clean
[SPEAKER_00]: information He always had we had you know
a couple books he had read about the topic
[SPEAKER_00]: or any and he'd gone back and found the
scientific papers behind it And and then
[SPEAKER_00]: he provided you with links, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could read that stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so it was beautiful He had the cleanest
information of anybody number two He
[SPEAKER_00]: developed those into best practices,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like like just knowing the information
wasn't enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always wanted to know how to apply This
knowledge that he got and so he would put
[SPEAKER_00]: together best practices whether or not it
was you know about cannabis breeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: diet or exercise or or You know,
you know of anti fragility and how he
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to build the systems of his life
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we've all heard this from him He
was always wanting to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply This how to that he was picking up
from these these books and documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then three he would do this kindness in
sharing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: he was always sharing and He did it in
this way that was accepting of wherever I
[SPEAKER_00]: was on a particular topic You know,
he didn't he didn't blow me out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water with information He would start slow
and kind of gauge where you were at as a
[SPEAKER_00]: listener and then he would change the
vocabulary and how deep he got based on
[SPEAKER_00]: who you were and so he was always
connecting with people at at their level
[SPEAKER_00]: to spread his information and And the best
practices that he had developed because he
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted everybody to grow good plants,
you know He wanted everybody to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good life He wanted everybody to have
reduced suffering and and Michael
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely believed that good information
was at the key to You know like decreasing
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering So then and then the last part
was like his joy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just joy in living everything that
Indy was doing he liked doing You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he put joy in everything He got up and he
lived his day with joy if he was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: a you know a conference or something He
was joyful there, you know, if you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: getting tacos with him, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was he was happy about having tacos
with you and and it's that approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: life that really made Michael stand out to
me And then once we got talking all the
[SPEAKER_00]: information stuff filled it in and really,
you know became the base of a basis of our
[SPEAKER_00]: friendship So so, you know what the Hindi
mentality means to me and then clean
[SPEAKER_00]: information Beautiful best practices that
he shot shared kindly with other Resulting
[SPEAKER_00]: in a joyous life that that he lived from
beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's that's the Hindi mentality
to me You
