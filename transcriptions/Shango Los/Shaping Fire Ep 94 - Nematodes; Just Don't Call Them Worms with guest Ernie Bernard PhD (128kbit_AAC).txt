[SPEAKER_00]: When I was new to cultivation,
I saw soil as dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have life, except for maybe
worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just filled pots with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes sense that I would think that
because I was raised being taught to
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilize my soil with fire before using
it in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sterile soil is dead soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I held onto that perspective for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started learning about the soil
food web because I wanted to grow thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it took was seeing just one Elaine
Ingham diagram of all the life that
[SPEAKER_00]: inhabits wild soil to immediately jerk me
out of that false reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized that soil was teeming with
life, teeming with microbes and a host of
[SPEAKER_00]: other participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I understood that complexity of
life was everywhere in soil, freshwater,
[SPEAKER_00]: the oceans and the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this microbiology was all around me
and I was essentially swimming in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more I read books and got
educated, the more I realized that every
[SPEAKER_00]: minute player in living soil had an
important role to play in the soil food
[SPEAKER_00]: web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems beautiful to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're here with us listening
today, you probably find it beautiful too.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Dr. Ernest Bernard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Bernard is a plant and soil nematology
researcher in the entomology and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pathology department at the University of
Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at his professional resume,
I see he was already a graduate assistant
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher in entomology at Michigan State
University in 1972, which means that he
[SPEAKER_00]: has been studying entomology for longer
than I have been alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2010, he was awarded Outstanding
Scientist of the Year for Biodiversity
[SPEAKER_00]: Education by Discover Life in America and
a NACDA Teaching Award in 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, he was awarded a team grant to
study microplastics and the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Bernard has also served as co-author
on several mycology publications and
[SPEAKER_00]: illustrated several papers on new
occurrences of plant diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does he publish scientific
papers, but he does the illustrations too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, Ernie teaches a university course
on classic film noir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're gonna talk about nematodes,
or nematodes as I learned it's properly
[SPEAKER_00]: pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important to point out in advance
that we really don't know very much about
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes and cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we don't really have a complete
picture of nematodes at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are an under-researched participant
in the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my questions today lead us on a few
paths which there are not solid answers
[SPEAKER_00]: for yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very appreciative to Dr. Bernard
for being vocal about where the science
[SPEAKER_00]: ends and pointing out fertile areas for
new research.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we will talk about
the physiology, habits, and life cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second set is all about the beneficial
activities of nematodes, both as a pest
[SPEAKER_00]: predator and essential participant in the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the last set, we talk about
parasitical nematodes and how to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: them establishing in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent over a year researching
nematologists, looking for one who had the
[SPEAKER_00]: depth of knowledge on nematodes,
was familiar with the cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and was willing to talk publicly about
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're incredibly rare, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not many people studying
nematodes, fewer who are studying
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes and cannabis, and nearly none
researching nematodes, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and are willing to talk about it publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So special thanks to Joe Romaneky at the
Entomological Society of America for
[SPEAKER_00]: helping me find Dr. Bernard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Dr. Bernard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be here, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, at the very beginning,
let's clarify something that is often
[SPEAKER_00]: confused in the cannabis cultivation
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I was preparing for our interview
today, it's actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of confusing for some people even in
the science literature, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a nematode an insect or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, people are often
referred to them as worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But taxonomically, they are classified
with insects in the same clade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to get us all on the same page,
would you would you kind of sort that out
[SPEAKER_00]: for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I jokingly tell my students in my
classes that if they use the term worm for
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes, they're going to lose some
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes about because they were
originally known as roundworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even a group of animal parasites
called whipworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the word worm is in there, but it's
okay as long as you say roundworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in Britain, they say eelworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nematodes are actually their own
phylum.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a separate, completely separate
group of organisms of a million species or
[SPEAKER_01]: more probably, well separated from the
arthropods, which is where the insects
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other arthropods are things like
spiders, mites, crustaceans, lobsters,
[SPEAKER_01]: those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in recent years, there is some
molecular evidence that there is some kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of relationship between the two groups
because they both, they're the only groups
[SPEAKER_01]: that really shed their skins in order to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not segmented, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're not segmented at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, no one would expect them to be
related except the very most remotely,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like we would be to earthworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is some molecular evidence that
they could be related, but you'd have to
[SPEAKER_01]: go way back, way back in deep time to
actually figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are basically no nematode
fossils out there and hardly any insect
[SPEAKER_01]: fossils that are earlier than 400 million
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to be correct when we speak
about nematodes and we'd lose points if we
[SPEAKER_00]: call them worm, but they're not exactly
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the best word for us to use to
describe them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's call them nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give them their own category.
That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that we're going to be talking
about a smaller subset of the nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: that exist today, because as you said,
we think that there might be up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred million species, which is
enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a million.
[SPEAKER_00]: A million.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a hundred million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be talking mostly about the ones
that interact with the cannabis garden
[SPEAKER_00]: today, but generally nematodes,
what is their range?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they just about everywhere on the
planet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nematodes are everywhere where there can
be a plant, bacteria, moss, or organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anywhere you think of that's not
covered permanently by ice and snow has
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Antarctic dry valleys, the highest
forms of life, there are three species of
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to go up the tops of
mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've collected them off the tops of,
you know, Haleakala in Hawaii and several
[SPEAKER_01]: other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're literally everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every step you take outside,
you are stepping on the homes of
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read that they outnumber other animal
species, both in individuals and in
[SPEAKER_00]: species counts, pretty much everywhere
they live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to tie this into cannabis container
guarding, would it be fair to say that in
[SPEAKER_00]: our containers or beds where we're growing
cannabis, that there are more nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: and more varieties of nematodes than
anything else in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you set up a container, I assume you
set it up with basically sterile media or
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's been steam sterilized,
something like that, there'll be no
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes there at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But gradually they come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are brought in by insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're blown in in a dry form and will
colonize the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the difference is you're not
likely to get plant parasites in
[SPEAKER_01]: containers unless you're kind of sloppy
and you're introducing field soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that for this particular
audience, that is exactly what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with much which much of the people,
you know, I know your expertise is with
[SPEAKER_00]: with growing hemp and so much of that
world is sterilizing the soil because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going into this controlled environment,
usually of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most of the people who are listening
to this show, though, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative growers who are wild crafting
inputs, using no till techniques for their
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, using last year's soil, bringing in
fermented plant juices from the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the people here have got pretty
wild, pretty wild soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal for most of us is to try to
keep that wild, broncing bull of soil in
[SPEAKER_00]: enough balance so that we can take
advantage of the thriving, living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: culture without it getting out of balance
and then, you know, developing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, fusarium or whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds to me that if many of us are
including wild crafted bits, even if we
[SPEAKER_00]: started with a bagged soil, we're
intentionally mucking it up ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like there is going to be a slew
of both number and variety of species of
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes in all of our pots, it sounds
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, you'll end up with,
it's hard to say how many will end up
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the surrounding environment
and what is directly affecting those pots,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's flying in, what's blowing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, you'll end up with a variety of
primarily bacterial feeders, some fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: feeders, even possibly some predators in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get unlucky, you'll have a plant
parasite that can attack the plant roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if, I'm not familiar with pot
culture of hemp, but if you have other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants around that you're not too careful
about, we're in close proximity to
[SPEAKER_01]: affected fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you run a greater risk of somehow
accidentally introducing these nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do nematodes travel?
[SPEAKER_00]: With some both pests and beneficial life
forms, you know, sometimes you can put
[SPEAKER_00]: pots pretty close to each other and they
don't go from pot to pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then sometimes you, if there's too
close, just simple splashing of water will
[SPEAKER_00]: spread them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the distance of travel for a
nematode usually?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nematodes aren't exactly world
travelers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fastest one, well, why that is such a
general question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the kind of nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the bacterial feeders move at a
pretty good clip and probably travel a few
[SPEAKER_01]: centimeters per day if they really were
trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant parasites don't move very far.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them are really what you would
call moving huge distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the record is the burrowing
nematode in Florida soils can move about
[SPEAKER_01]: three feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's only in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to climb out of a pot
and then climb up another pot and get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, yes, splashing water is a great
way for them to get around.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, any kind of flowing water is good
for moving nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can rely passively on some breeze
if they happen to be in the right spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have leaf litter that happens to
have some of them have climbed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another problem is that some nematodes can
undergo anhydrubiosis, which means they
[SPEAKER_01]: dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're still alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a physiology that allows that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are easily blown around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're dry and lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we are experiencing a pest nematode
issue, which we'll talk more about later,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is clearly a case where our first
line of defense is going to be material
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sanitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sanitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spread your don't splash your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spread your soil when you're don't
let your leaf litter go from one plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those basics.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there are so many nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and from this point forward,
we're going to start focusing more on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that interact with the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, compared to the overall nematode
world of a million species, how many are
[SPEAKER_00]: are we generally going to be dealing with
in a living soil and cannabis environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're talking about like field soil,
which is what I would be most familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with, I still would say it's a black hole
because there's been basically no field
[SPEAKER_01]: research done done yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crop is too new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nematologists are not really have not
really geared up a lot to do that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you would have the typical in a
handful of soil, you'd probably have 20 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 species of nematodes, some more
abundant than others in a whole field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be talking 200, 300,
400 species of nematodes, most of which
[SPEAKER_01]: would not be plant parasites, but would be
predators or bacterial feeders or fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're kind of at a black hole with
regard to what is actually happening at
[SPEAKER_01]: this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for for many cannabis cultivators,
we are most familiar with the with the the
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs of all varieties that we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you can see them,
you're more aware of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to look you look them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and generally they're easier to
deal with when you can see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and because microscopy skills are
are still very much growing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivation scene, not a lot of
people are putting their soil under their
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopes yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you describe for us like the size
relation of a nematode?
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of the ones that we're going to be
talking about are we can actually see with
[SPEAKER_00]: the naked eye and and maybe a little bit
of what what they would look like if we
[SPEAKER_00]: did throw one under a microscope?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, nematodes are the word is actually
nematode comes from the word thread is
[SPEAKER_01]: that means thread like in Greek.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because you can actually see them
with the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all you see is a tiny little twisting
white thing, maybe half a millimeter long
[SPEAKER_01]: to a millimeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some some species in the soil do get up to
a couple of millimeters, but really
[SPEAKER_01]: they're quite small.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't make any detail like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they require and they can also people
can also mistake those from a very small
[SPEAKER_01]: what are called enky trade worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're true worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're white and very small, small insect
larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do they look like under?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, another thing I should mention is they
don't nematodes don't contract and and
[SPEAKER_01]: elongate like an inch worm or an
earthworm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They not don't have the capability to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you look like under the micro
look for in the microscope?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the there's no segmentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the body is not divided in major
divisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is they're pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both ends are usually rounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tail end is kind of pointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The important part of a nematode is the
mouth parts, which we call the stoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once you see the stoma,
you know exactly what that nematode does.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a wide, if it's a wide open stoma
like a tube, it's taking a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a thing that looks like a
hypodermic needle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a stylet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It either is a plant parasite or a fungal
parasite, or it could be a predator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some with large teeth inside
that are probably predators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it the front end of the nematode is the
business end as far as determining what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what can determine that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can determine that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, relatively low power,
10 or 20, 100, 100 X would probably work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is actually getting them out
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we have specialized
techniques for doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not complicated, but they do
involve a little bit of time and effort to
[SPEAKER_01]: float them out of the soil so you can
actually get some.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that technique for gathering
worms?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk often about adding, you know,
melons or avocados.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the top of the soil, which pulls,
you know, regular earthworms up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you've got my attention here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this trick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well, it's not really a trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that watermelon thing is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably, if you left that there for
several days and dropped pieces in water,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd probably get some nematodes coming
out that have been, that were near the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface and attracted into it and are
reproducing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have someone try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the technique we use is called the
sugar flotation centrifugation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably more than what most
growers want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it is, is you take a soil sample,
like a handful of soil, you put it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: beaker, you fill it up to about 800 mils
and you mix it up really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you pour it through nested screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use an 80 over a 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a 400 mesh screen is about,
I think, 35 micrometer openings on the
[SPEAKER_01]: holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 25, I think it's 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very tiny holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the top screen, the 80 mesh,
is about half a millimeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It catches most of the debris and you end
up with the nematodes and the finer
[SPEAKER_01]: material on this very fine screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bottom screen is to catch the
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you rinse those into a centrifuge
tube, spin them, spin them down,
[SPEAKER_01]: pour off the water, add a sugar solution,
mix it up and spin it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sugar solution has the same density as
a nematode body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you put it through the centrifuge
again, the soil goes to the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tube, the nematodes stay in suspension and
we can pour that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we do it in our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are simpler methods involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this might be really practical for
people that don't have a centrifuge and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the other equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a bareman funnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a variation also called a
bareman pan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're basically the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a very fine screen or just kind
of porous tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, nematodes were once said to be in
operation as long as they had a funnel and
[SPEAKER_01]: a piece of toilet paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a funnel and you have a little
screen inside that fits inside that
[SPEAKER_01]: funnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just cut that out of anything,
a aluminum screen or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you lay a piece of tissue over
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can really be just like one layer
of Kleenex.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put your soil, at the bottom of the
funnel, you attach a tube like with a
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of rubber tubing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Attach a tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you fill it up with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put in your screen, the tissue,
add your soil very gently on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to be kind of submerged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's damp or wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The active nematodes are gradually wiggle
through to the bottom, fall through the
[SPEAKER_01]: screen and sink into this tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after two or three days, you can take
that tube off and let's see what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it requires active, nematodes are
active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them aren't very active.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it will give a fair idea of what you
might have out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that method has been around a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with you that there are
probably few cultivators who are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do the first version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's probably even few cultivators
that would bother to do the second
[SPEAKER_00]: version.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why I wanted it included is
because if somebody's listening to this
[SPEAKER_00]: show, because they are either curious to
know what number of nematodes they have in
[SPEAKER_00]: their growing environment, or if they
suspect that their substrate's being taken
[SPEAKER_00]: over by nematodes, which we'll talk more
about later, that would be a great tool
[SPEAKER_00]: for somebody to do that and go,
oh my God, look at all these nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I need to look into this more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should also point out the other thing
they can do in that case, and if they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have a problem with it, is they can
send samples to their extension agent or
[SPEAKER_01]: extension offices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every state has them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've probably heard that before.
For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get a nematode analysis done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, these extension offices are
becoming more and more comfortable with
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to us cannabis folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, your mileage may vary on
that, but hopefully you get somebody who's
[SPEAKER_00]: open to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we talk about a
lot on Shaping Fire is the living soil of
[SPEAKER_00]: food web and how the different
participants in the rhizosphere are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: different jobs, that when they all come
together, you have a thriving,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy soil that's in balance,
that is not susceptible to disease
[SPEAKER_00]: outbreaks, and you'll have a really good
flower run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we all shoot for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think many of us understand the
role that nematodes play in that beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: melody that is the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you kind of walk us through
essentially day in a life of nematode?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they spending their time doing so
that we can understand their purpose a
[SPEAKER_00]: little better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nematodes, because they do have
different feeding strategies, occupy
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty broad range in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just start with the, we get leaf
litter or other organic matter lying on
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gradually consumed by millipedes,
isopods, earthworms, and it gets broken
[SPEAKER_01]: down, and the fungi and bacteria then move
in and are more efficient at decaying and
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming this tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the nematodes actually come along
then, the nematodes are there to begin
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this helps to keep the cycle,
keep the entire nutrient cycle going in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're consuming bacteria,
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are predators that attack amoebae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, some are insect parasites as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they consume those organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they die.
[SPEAKER_01]: They become incorporated in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: At each level, we're getting a breakdown
that provides easier nutrition for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get this constant cycling of
organic matter of nutrition in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nematodes form an important step in
that they're consuming fungi and bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: that are engaged in the digestion of
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds to me like that they would be
very useful in regenerating out of
[SPEAKER_00]: balance, you know, crop land or beds or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like they, you know,
they are digesting machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're trying to clean up beds that
have got, you know, bacterial outbreaks or
[SPEAKER_00]: something that, you know, they are
essentially helping clean the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: and renew it constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice that you mention bacteria
because if you have, because many of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial feeders have very short
lifespans or very short life cycles,
[SPEAKER_01]: some as little as two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from egg to adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can get huge numbers building
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not on exactly the same thing we're
talking about, but we did a graduate
[SPEAKER_01]: student at the University of Tennessee did
a wonderful study on soil fauna when
[SPEAKER_01]: cadavers are placed on top of the soil,
we use beavers and human beings at the
[SPEAKER_01]: world famous body farm, we say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found bacterial feeders exploded in
enormous, enormous numbers, hardly
[SPEAKER_01]: detectable before they're put in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after two or three weeks, we had 15 to
20,000 in basically a handful of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they respond very quickly to those
kinds of imbalances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has not, I don't know how much
that has been tried, but there have been
[SPEAKER_01]: some really good studies recently on the
effect of rebalancing nematode communities
[SPEAKER_01]: in forests by various means, organic
amendments or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's found that it really has improved
the health of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like there's a lot of
opportunities for research in nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've mentioned a couple of different
times that either there's an opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere or it's a black hole or the
research is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds to me that if somebody is
interested in living soil and cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: they find nematodes interesting that
there's a lot of promising research to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no end to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there aren't that many nematologists
in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of us are working on crop
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are working on basic ecological
questions are not as numerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I and all my colleagues, we all have so
many ideas that we're never going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for sheer manpower or person power.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that just about everybody who
is here today is here to be talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and wrap up this first
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we come back with set two,
we're going to start off with the meat of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pie there on the beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is Dr. Ernie Bernard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now without these advertisers shaping fire
would not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know
that you heard them on shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges with buying
autoflower seeds is that often you'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: as many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be fun, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so many varieties in one pack is a
sign of an immature seed line that hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been worked enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer my autoflowers to be worked
enough that each phenome in the pack
[SPEAKER_00]: really captures the aspects that the
breeder was intending.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I recommend gnome automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_00]: automatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nome automatics seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizable by its traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traits that were hard earned so that you
can have your best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nome automatics became a trusted and loved
brand in cannabis over the last 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: as Mandalorian Genetics and recently
changed their name to gnome automatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that has changed is the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Founder Dan Jimmy continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_00]: variety he releases for you to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the gnome automatics Instagram
at gnome underscore automatics to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can score gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_00]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms interested in bulk seeds of more
than a thousand should reach out through
[SPEAKER_00]: the website too.
[SPEAKER_00]: While on the website, be sure to check out
the gnome automatics shirts and other
[SPEAKER_00]: merch section.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want reliable seeds, hand-built
from effort, expert selection and
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, choose gnome automatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry and today many
cannabis cultivators are moving from
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays and chemicals to beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert has the beneficial insects,
mites and nematodes, microbials,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky cards and air distribution units
you need to partner with nature to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_00]: from chemical sprays towards clean and

[SPEAKER_00]: A fully functioning greenhouse grows
extraordinary cannabis flowers that have
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal, great terpene
profiles and exceptional yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we have discussed many times on
shaping fire, a greenhouse is only as good
[SPEAKER_00]: as the environment you create for the
plants inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotherm has been on the forefront of
developing and installing highly efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse solutions since 1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether new construction, major upgrades
or a retrofit, Biotherm's cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: climate solutions are tailored to each
grower's specifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even have root zone heating mats that
attach to a home hot water heater for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing areas 500 square feet or smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atmosphere of the growing environment
directly affects the health and
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity of your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotherm offers heating, cooling,
dehumidification and CO2 enrichment to
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize the air your plants breathe and
optimize plant growth by enhancing the
[SPEAKER_00]: elements within the cultivation space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotherm's dissolved oxygen irrigation
solutions will improve the vitality of
[SPEAKER_00]: your water and the efficiency of your
hydro delivery system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you implement Biotherm's systemic
innovation, you'll experience increased
[SPEAKER_00]: yields, improved plant vigor and increased
resistance to disease and pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotherm offers free phone and email
support for everything they sell and will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you troubleshoot and diagnose issues
to get your equipment back online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The explosion of greenhouse cultivation
has crowded the field with novice
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants selling unproven gadgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you choose Biotherm to regulate your
greenhouse environment, you know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: relying on their over 40 years of
experience designing, installing and
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting mission critical greenhouse
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants deserve nothing less than
Biotherm.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is Dr. Ernie Bernard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we got a better
idea of who our neighborhood nematode is,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit about their life cycle, what their
interests are and that there's so many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them everywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here in the second set, we're going to
focus more on beneficial nematodes in both
[SPEAKER_00]: how we can use the nematodes to protect
our plants in the garden and the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also we'll talk a bit about
making an environment that's good for them
[SPEAKER_00]: to live since they are our allies in
sustaining living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ernie, the number one thing that people
in cannabis cultivation turned to
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial nematodes for is fungus gnats
because lots of people, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: inexperienced or they overwater or they
have got a watering system that they find
[SPEAKER_00]: out too late is watering a bit heavy and
boom, you've got fungus gnats and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: super annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people, their first thought is,
okay, I need to use the nematode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would, kind of walk us through
the relationship between fungus gnats and
[SPEAKER_00]: then their production of larvae and where
the nematodes come in to be a helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: participant in our garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sirens, fungus gnats, definitely a
problem about everybody has, it grows
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we have them in our greenhouse and
we also have a lot of millipede cultures
[SPEAKER_01]: going in the lab for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get plenty of fungus gnats in
there, can't seem to help it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the larvae of fungus gnats,
and I'm not a specialist on these,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what I do know is they eat rotting
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of wet organic matter will
mean a lot of fungus gnats developing,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if it's on the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that, some of your listeners
probably know better than me whether they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually attack cannabis roots themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of them will.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nematode being talked about,
I don't recall the name of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is an enema pathogenic nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's available commercially quite a
bit that's applied to soil that will
[SPEAKER_01]: infect those fungus gnats, larvae,
and kill them before they become adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say as long as the instructions are
followed carefully, they should work fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use the word infect, are we
actually meaning like eat the larvae,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll eat the larvae, or is there some
kind of viral or bacteria that's passed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how to take the word infect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't quite remember the name of the
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you have it at hand there that
attacks fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically these nematodes are,
they're produced as anhydrobiotic
[SPEAKER_01]: juveniles, so they're dried out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in a dry state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're added to soil surface and wetted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This revives them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take water up and they begin moving
around again.
[SPEAKER_01]: They carry in the anterior part of their
intestine a certain kind of bacterium.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they locate a fungus gnat,
they enter the larvae through a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be through the spiracles,
how they larvae breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be through the back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might even wiggle it through the
mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they get inside and they defecate
these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria multiply rapidly,
prodigiously, and that's what actually
[SPEAKER_01]: kills the larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: The consumption of the tissues inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they've consumed those, while they're
consuming those, now the nematodes are
[SPEAKER_01]: inside, they start feeding crazily on
these bacteria because that's their food
[SPEAKER_01]: source, not really the gnat itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they reproduce very quickly,
within a few days, producing hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of new eggs that can later hatch
and produce infective larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why nematodes are good both if you
have an outbreak and also as a defensive
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism to keep you from ever getting
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you've got a large population
of nematodes, they're constantly eating
[SPEAKER_00]: their way through larvae and depositing
this bacteria, which I'm guessing and
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping that this bacteria is also
probiotic for the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's the catch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacterium only survives inside the
nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Envision female nematodes inside the larva
of the fungus gnat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're producing lots and lots of eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those eggs hatch inside the larva of the
fungus gnat larva, and they're eating
[SPEAKER_01]: prodigiously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of them will go to maturity and
produce more eggs, but most of them will
[SPEAKER_01]: stop, they'll reach a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a trigger inside with too many
nematodes and not enough bacteria or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, and they stop development.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the fungus gnat larva dies,
these larvae then begin to dry up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they hold within part of their
intestine, they hold some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they are a package just waiting for
another larva to come around under
[SPEAKER_01]: favorable circumstances that they can
penetrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's the rub about these
bacteria is they're not free living.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting too,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an amazingly specific evolved system
and tool that is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like carrying your lunch with you
when you move across country.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so another thing that makes
nematodes seem like an obvious player
[SPEAKER_00]: against these fungus gnats is that,
if I understand correctly, nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly live near the top of the soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they live exactly where the fungus gnat
problem is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you'd like to have them,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, these kinds of insect parasitic
nematodes usually have a way to track
[SPEAKER_01]: prey.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two different groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ambush predators and there are
[SPEAKER_01]: ambush and there's another group that
actually seeks them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They move around and I'm not using the
right term.
[SPEAKER_01]: One group just sits waiting, some just sit
waiting for a particular host to come
[SPEAKER_01]: along.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones are called, that's
embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way or another, they chase.
[SPEAKER_01]: They chase, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to another variety of
pest that people tend to turn to nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in the general nematode scientific
literature, Western flower thrips are
[SPEAKER_00]: named as one of the pest varieties that
beneficial nematodes can be used against
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is common for cannabis culture
cultivators to read Western flower thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: and even though I'm not aware of Western
flower thrip being a threat in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all see that word thrip, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all have such problems with thrips
and we're really looking for good
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions that people use the nematodes
for the cannabis thrips that we get,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've never actually seen the evidence
that that is inappropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matchup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you familiar with any system where the
nematodes will go after our cannabis thrip
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are nematodes that attack
thrips, but I've not studied them really
[SPEAKER_01]: very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to know if that really works
because our greenhouses have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse thrips and the black,
the dark brown ones are really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can't provide any information on
that really.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we said, the study of nematodes is a
huge area and I don't expect you to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something on everything, but I do know
that you have studied their interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: with the hemp plant and I don't know how
wide the research is there that you've had
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity to do because as we've
already discussed, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different research to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm getting at is what other
pests other than fungus gnats can you
[SPEAKER_00]: share with us that nematodes are effective
in combating?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of nematodes out there now
and available commercially for all kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of pests, grubs, other fly larvae,
caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a wide range of product available
now that can be used or at least tried
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them have kind of specific
environmental requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has to be enough water, not too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperatures and things like that,
the way that they're applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fleas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fleas can be controlled this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But each pest pretty much has its own
particular nematode that can attack it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like several different kinds of
caterpillars have one species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beetle grubs might have a different
species and there may be variants in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I was actually approaching this
from the wrong direction because what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing is that if there's a million or
more species and I'm getting the idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes tend to be picky eaters when it
comes to other animals, that really what
[SPEAKER_00]: should happen is the cultivator should
figure out and identify what their pest is
[SPEAKER_00]: and then kind of reverse engineer it to
find what nematode is specific for theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it isn't like, oh, all right,
we're going to add this one nematode which
[SPEAKER_00]: eats 20 variety of pests and we're just
going to dump a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually takes some homework to make
sure that we get the specific nematode
[SPEAKER_00]: that is correct for whatever our pest
would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many different species of insect
parasite nematodes out there, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not generalists.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may take a small range of pests,
but you won't find any one that will take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly wouldn't apply something
that's used for beetle grubs to try and
[SPEAKER_01]: throw thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's total waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they're very different nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that some of us who got into
beneficial insects by learning about
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory mites that will eat our pest to
spot spider mite, you see the list,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, oh, if I add this mite,
it attacks these nine different varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I was approaching nematodes
as like, okay, which nematode is the
[SPEAKER_00]: generalist that I want to focus on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not really the right way to
think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny that I have to mention this
about using mites to control two spotted
[SPEAKER_01]: mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally we have two spotted mite
outbreaks and thrips outbreaks in our
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do apply bio-controls that are specific
for these pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I was watching once, there was a
nice thrips sitting there on the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: a leaf and a predatory mite comes along,
approaches it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It touches the thrips, the thrips wiggles,
the mite runs away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, dude, play your position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if my approach with looking for a
nematode generalist wasn't accurate,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's kind of change the direction of the
conversation to creating an environment in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil that will attract and provide a
good home for the nematodes that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm starting to get the idea that
if a soil is in balance, it will naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: have healthy nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we let our soil get out of
balance, we start to develop parasitic
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes, which we're going to talk about
in the third set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the living environment that the
beneficial nematodes that we want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive in our pots as our defense
mechanism, what is that environment that
[SPEAKER_00]: they do best in and what can we do to make
it a cozy place where they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, wow, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want to grow really good cannabis,
or any crop really,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have a lot of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would keep the nutrition high in the
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would avoid over-watering and
under-watering, especially over-watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is such a broad question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're essentially describing is
good container gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it sounds to me like so long as you
are doing the things that we know help
[SPEAKER_00]: with organic growing, and you're not out
of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pH isn't off for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making sure to use compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long as you're doing the things that we
in the regenerative community naturally do
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway for the good of the plant,
those are all the same things that a
[SPEAKER_00]: nematode wants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for the bacterial feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all nematodes would be happy with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a container-type situation,
you're going to end up largely with
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial feeders and fungal feeders in
the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the nematodes who are
responsible for getting good
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon-nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some very complicated research,
very good research that I've done at UC
[SPEAKER_01]: Davis on this approach of a balance of
bacterial and fungal feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, you'll get both kinds in there
because they're naturally brought in
[SPEAKER_01]: gradually by other insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're blown in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be picked up and carried by wind
out of a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant parasites you're not likely to
get unless there's a breakdown in the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that you handle your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that I want to have the
nematodes in my pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is the way that you just
suggested by letting them get there by
[SPEAKER_00]: happenstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say that I want to intentionally
equip the pot with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we've already talked about,
there are commercial varieties that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm curious to know is, is it
possible to add the nematodes and create a
[SPEAKER_00]: self-replicating community where they are
making more nematodes into the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is their life cycle such, I don't know,
maybe it's too short, or they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce enough, or whatever there might
be about their life cycle, where I should
[SPEAKER_00]: be adding nematodes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of the providers,
they suggest that you're your hand adding
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's what's necessary,
OK, fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my head and in the head of most of
us into living soil growing, we would love
[SPEAKER_00]: to have there be a community of nematodes
that reproduces and maybe even expands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we add them once, but keep our soil
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got nematode defense
mechanisms forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that unreasonable?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually, every two weeks means you're
not effective at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that initial addition,
as long as the pot is fine, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have soil that's naturally being
colonized by bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just blowing it out of the air in
the water supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are already present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adding the nematodes, they should
reproduce and continue to grow to a
[SPEAKER_01]: population that is sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside the pot, if they run out of food,
their numbers are going to drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the supply demand thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until that builds up again,
then they will increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why they would not maintain
themselves in these pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any reason to add a food source
for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that if they grow in number where
they outstrip their food source,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll just die or not reproduce as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can totally hear the listeners who
are saying, yeah, but I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: supercharge my pot with nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a bacteria that I can add so
they'll eat more of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see how that could be a
dangerous road to go under.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's ask the question anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that we would want to
feed the nematodes specifically like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is feeding the nematodes just keeping
your pot in balance?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think keeping your pot in balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what you would feed them
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you pour a bacterial broth in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds dangerous, but that is
what I was imagining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how well that would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can rely on a naturally rapid
reproduction of bacterial feeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat slower than fungal feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going to rely on them to
actually occupy their niche in that pot
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the places they can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may fluctuate up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that depends on the background food
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're living off dying roots or old
cells or other organisms that might get in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard of anyone actually
augmenting a pot and getting a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, the literature is pretty
vast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could miss something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, the people in the regenerative
cannabis scene, we're kind of mad
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it would not surprise me at all
that somebody out there is all like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, well, if they eat bacteria,
what is a bacteria that I can produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just start experimenting
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we all kind of consider ourselves
citizen scientists, even though it gets us
[SPEAKER_00]: in trouble sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think any kind of experimentation where
this formal just trying stuff is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how do we learn anything if we
don't do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a non sequitur
corollary question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see if you've got something for
me on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very often, people are directed to add
nematodes to their crops through a
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a lot of discussion with not
a lot of clarity about the varieties of
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayers or nozzle types.
[SPEAKER_00]: To not use because some of the higher
pressure ones can rip apart the nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: as they're going through the nozzle is
what I have been told.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have first person experience
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have anything to share with us
about application by spray, best practices
[SPEAKER_00]: at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anything specific on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the products, when they're sold,
they should have a recommendation for what
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of spray to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly want to use our super high
pressure one or one that puts out really
[SPEAKER_01]: fine droplets.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a small operation, maybe you could mix
it up in a watering can and just water it
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as the living environments for
the nematodes, a lot of us like to mix up
[SPEAKER_00]: our own soil with different amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's perfectly made for our beloved
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any soil amendments?
[SPEAKER_00]: That are specifically appreciated by
nematodes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it never hurts to have organic
matter of some kind in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our greenhouse, we use commercial mix
that we buy in bulk by 10 or 12 bales at a
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how directly that affects
them, but it allows for better drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use basically pure sand with organic
matter in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd think that sand would drain really
fast, but some organic matter in there
[SPEAKER_01]: really helps to drain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just helps provide channels for them to
move around in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being worm-like, I can imagine that they
would not like compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That starts us down where we're going to
start with the next set where compacted
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is going to decrease their ability to
move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compacted soil also creates hydrophobic
soil on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting the idea since nematodes
interact so effectively with water that
[SPEAKER_00]: they really do need a moist but not
sopping environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you get one of the key points about
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nematodes are actually aquatic animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They require a water film to move around
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, when they move, they're pushing
against the water film.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no way of burrowing through soil
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to have the connectedness of the
soil pores in order to get around.
[SPEAKER_01]: A very highly compacted soil is pretty
much impervious to all but small
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would seem then that this would also be
a case for a living green mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might call it a cover crop or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small plants that live below the cannabis
plants that have got roots going down that
[SPEAKER_00]: create highways for the water to go from
the surface and down into the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like that kind of a living moist
root environment would be one that
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes would be like, hell yeah,
we like living here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that also provides additional food
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: More roots means more bacteria growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing on the roots, more fungi
attacking dead cells or even the live
[SPEAKER_01]: roots themselves, so sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably more variety too since these
different plants are very likely to have
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of bacteria on the roots
than the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of specificity now we're
finding out about bacteria on roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some specificity for nematodes
that eat bacteria that may favor one kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of bacterium over another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we go to the second commercial
break, I want to talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: who would predate our ally nematodes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going through all this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're either attracting nematodes or we're
adding nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to keep our soil in balance
both for the plant but also for all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials that are in the soil,
including the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand how the tree of life
works enough to know that somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably eating my nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who are the threats to my beneficial
nematodes in the pot or just anywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big disparity between those that
get in pots easily like bacterial and
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal feeders and predators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacterial and fungal feeders have very
short lifespans, but they lay a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The predators have much longer lifespans,
at least fewer eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also not nearly as, I don't know,
portable or transportable as the other
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be kind of uncommon to see
most predators in those pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing about the predators,
something to keep in mind too,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that we're talking predator-prey
relationships with nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no different for them than it is for
mammals, looking at lynxes and snowshoe
[SPEAKER_01]: rabbits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a large prey population.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a small predator population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of the differences in length
of life cycle, number of eggs produced,
[SPEAKER_01]: they stay pretty much in those
proportions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard of, let's say,
a predator population overwhelming the
[SPEAKER_01]: prey.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always more prey coming along than
there are predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is both surprising and good to
hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to be focusing on making
sure that we've got enough nematodes in
[SPEAKER_00]: our growing environment, the idea that
they will just be there effectively unless
[SPEAKER_00]: we kill them, that sounds pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens to, you mentioned a little
bit of this in the first set, but I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to dig in a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when the environment does
fall out of balance?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are varieties of microbes,
et cetera, who if the soil gets dry or the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH changes or something, they'll cyst up
and do what we think of as hibernation
[SPEAKER_00]: with a protective outer shell of a mucus
or something until the conditions in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil are favorable again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they restart their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm curious to know what defense
mechanisms nematodes have for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, because I want to hear you talk about
that body drying out cycle again,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also I want to get a better handle on
the idea that if I inadvertently drowned
[SPEAKER_00]: my pot, am I actually going to wipe out
the nematodes or do I just need to wait
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to come back?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it's a combination question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's talk about the flooding first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the 50s and 60s, all kinds of
things tried to kill nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder when it was flooding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flood a field and see how long it
takes to kill all the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does work, but you've also ruined your
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temporary flooding is not going to really
damage your nematodes very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're aquatic organisms and they take in
oxygen, but they can become quiescent,
[SPEAKER_01]: which just means they stop moving and they
just stay quiet and just wait it out until
[SPEAKER_01]: water drains away, more oxygen is
available again, and they can begin moving
[SPEAKER_01]: around again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be pretty difficult to do that unless
you set a pot in a cistern or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: fill it up with water and just wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like did it intentionally, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as drying out, the thing about
soils drying out is you never really get
[SPEAKER_01]: them dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel dry, but they still have a thin
film of water around all the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: particles held on very, very strongly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nematodes themselves are held
strongly in that very, very thin layer of
[SPEAKER_01]: water and can't move.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't mean they're necessarily
going to die because the pot has dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you really let it go a long time,
or it's really getting dry, the nematodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: many nematodes, not all, but many,
can undergo this process called
[SPEAKER_01]: anhydrobiosis, which means life without
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They undergo physiological changes that
push certain compounds into their proteins
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep them deforming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they lose almost all their water,
95% of their water, and they just sit
[SPEAKER_01]: there basically dry as dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when water returns, and this could be
months or years later, I think the record
[SPEAKER_01]: is, oh, I better not say, I think it's
more than 15 years, once water comes back,
[SPEAKER_01]: they revive in anywhere from minutes to
hours and just pick up like nothing ever
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's really convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear- That is nice,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm glad to hear that they're so
likely to rebound because, honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is so common, maybe not as common,
in an automated commercial setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: but so much of our audience is home
growers and patients who are growing their
[SPEAKER_00]: own cannabis for their own ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is sadly very common for us to go
from an overwatered, a drowned pot to,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, gosh, I added too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better not water it for a couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now it's on the other side and
it's bone dry because they were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make up for the overwatering, in which
case now it's hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we drown it again, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a mistake once in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was adding just, we used Peters as a
supplemental fertilizer, and I added too
[SPEAKER_01]: much, inadvertently, I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I looked at the plants the next
day, they were all wilted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, I don't want to lose these
young hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just watered the heck out of them to
wash that fertilizer through, and sure
[SPEAKER_01]: enough, they revived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a total loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's great because there's so many
other ways for us to make mistakes and
[SPEAKER_00]: kill everything in our pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to know that somebody has got
the ability to rebound a little better
[SPEAKER_00]: than some of our other allies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take a commercial
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we come back, we are going to talk
about parasitic nematodes, what many of us
[SPEAKER_00]: consider pest nematodes, even though
they're uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to learn about them and talk
about what they're like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is Dr. Ernie Bernard.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a peat moss replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_00]: container growing, but organic growers are
recognizing now that peat moss is an
[SPEAKER_00]: unsustainable resource, and the mining of
peat bogs destroys wetland habitats and
[SPEAKER_00]: releases sequestered carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that provides
[SPEAKER_00]: better benefits while being a sustainable
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems, is actually made from upcycled
organic paper and cardboard headed for
[SPEAKER_00]: landfills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: in tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption, and water
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades-long
[SPEAKER_00]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is lightweight and easy to use,
and pit moss is inert, so it won't change
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available in a range of preparations,
including a nutrient-enhanced blend and an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic soil conditioner with no added
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding for horses, chickens, and small
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is Dr. Ernie Bernard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are in set three, and we are
going to talk about the parasitic
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes, which I actually thought were a
lot more common than Dr. Bernard has kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of suggested earlier in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about them, because they're
the bad guys, and we should be prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, mostly what I understand
about these parasitic nematodes is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they like to eat the roots and slow the
growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also kind of get the idea that they
are way more common than I think we think
[SPEAKER_00]: they are, because most people interpret
what's happening with the plant as a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you go through these plant
parasite nematodes and kind of explain how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're working against us in the
rhizosphere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I'd be glad to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plant parasite nematodes are very
common.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can look out a window and see some
grass or forest or trees, there are plant
[SPEAKER_01]: parasite nematodes feeding on those
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a kind of a balanced environment,
let's say an undisturbed forest or even a
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term meadow, they're all at balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking their little share of food,
but it's not enough to really hurt,
[SPEAKER_01]: really damage anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when we go to monocultures,
high-intensity agricultural production,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we begin to see that these nematodes
begin to dominate, because we are removing
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the constraints that keep them
down, such as other parasites,
[SPEAKER_01]: other predators, diseases of nematodes,
fungi that attack nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they become more predominant,
because we've altered that natural
[SPEAKER_01]: arrangement that has been developing for
millions upon millions of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plant parasitic nematodes are also
called phytoparasitic, or abbreviated,
[SPEAKER_01]: we call them PPNs, because we get tired of
saying plant parasitic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their mouth is modified into needle-like
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks just like a hypodermic needle,
actually, that they use to puncture roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they puncture roots, they inject
enzymes that dissolve the contents of root
[SPEAKER_01]: cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they suck that back out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's their food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some nematodes just feed on the surface of
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not of much consequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called ectoparasites, because
they're on the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have endoparasites.
[SPEAKER_01]: One group of endoparasites enters the
roots and migrates around in the outer
[SPEAKER_01]: tissues, the cortex, just feeding as they
go, laying eggs in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more important than the
ectoparasites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have what are called the sedentary
endoparasites.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are nematodes that enter a root,
find a nice spot in the vascular tissue,
[SPEAKER_01]: the xylem or the phloem, establish a
specialized feeding site by injection of
[SPEAKER_01]: various plant hormones or plant hormone
analogs, or they get the plant to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce specialized feeding cells,
and then they settle down there,
[SPEAKER_01]: protected from the environment,
because they're inside the root,
[SPEAKER_01]: and can produce lots and lots of eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the most important ones,
because they're directly taking
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic nutrients from the plant by
their feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: In nature, let's say I'm near the Great
Smoky Mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go up in the Smokies and sample
around a tree, I'm going to find all these
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not in really high numbers,
because they're balanced out with
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a phenomenon we call soil stasis,
where everything is checking everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else to make sure nobody gets out of
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when we begin to manipulate the
environment, we begin to see problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make sense to me that these plant
parasitic nematodes or PPNs are more
[SPEAKER_00]: common in monocultures or in especially
aggressive commercial environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: because both of those varieties are
intentionally trying to maximize growth by
[SPEAKER_00]: intentionally having the biosphere be out
of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's solid host root is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a perfect environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more diverse that plant community is,
the less likely any nematode is to become
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a monoculture, the food is
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to take the opposite,
which would be either living soil versus
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not hydro, but a living soil commercial
cannabis environment that might be beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: or living soil pots, or a home grower,
or an outdoor craft grower in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that all these people have
in common is that they are all trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep their soil complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very act of trying to keep our soil
complex sounds like it itself is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: defense against plant parasitic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I wonder what complex means.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of amendments and things like that
will definitely be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, meaning lots of top dressing with
mulches and compost teas and inoculant
[SPEAKER_00]: with mycelium to make sure that you've got
a good fungal environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the things that folks who are doing
their best to cause a thriving complex
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil to do, which is what our
variety of cultivator does for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like by trying to take care of
the plant soil as best possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are also acting as a natural defense
mechanism against these parasites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot of good evidence out
there for the use of composting,
[SPEAKER_01]: soil amendments, and rotations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about a rotation would be like
a wheat-soybean rotation in one year that
[SPEAKER_01]: really do significantly reduce plant
parasitic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about that earlier because
there's not really a lot of crop rotation
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either in licensed or unlicensed because
in the licensed environment, your space is
[SPEAKER_00]: so controlled by the regulatory part of
your license, like where you're growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much canopy you've got, how much you
can afford to fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more of repeated growing in
the same location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, people use the same pots over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reading I was doing in preparation,
the three season crop rotation seemed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the number one suggestion for folks so
that you mix up the food sources to
[SPEAKER_00]: discourage these parasitic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be suggested, oh, we should do
that too, but it really doesn't sound like
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitic nematodes are enough of a
problem to justify that effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the jury is out on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Historically, I think you've seen the
paper and heard my presentation before.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go back with the regulation of
cannabis, so that really wasn't grown at
[SPEAKER_01]: all from the 1930s on, this eliminated an
entire, how many, 60, 70 years of
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when nematology was really taking
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first report of plant parasitic
nematodes on hemp in the US was in 1935.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right after that, of course, production
was shut down except for wartime
[SPEAKER_01]: necessities, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing was done on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consequently, we don't have enough history
yet working on it to know whether PPNs are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a severe problem in production
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that there are some that will
really attack it based on some European
[SPEAKER_01]: research and some Indian research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as here, we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to say the jury's still living it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if that research still hasn't come
to conclusion yet, I know that this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to ask you an estimated guess
question, but let's say that we do find
[SPEAKER_00]: that PPNs are going to be an issue for us
in cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that you would recommend
us to do to rid ourselves of these PPNs
[SPEAKER_00]: other than just bring the soil back into
balance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an organic solution to these
parasitic nematodes or is it as simple as
[SPEAKER_00]: get your soil back into balance and the
PPNs will just go away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they don't go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they're there, let's say that you've
introduced them into your field
[SPEAKER_01]: inadvertently or you just happen to find
out that they're there, they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's extremely difficult to eliminate
some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had nematodes that, let's say,
were hemp-specific and that's all they
[SPEAKER_01]: attacked, that'd be easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just not grow hemp on that area for a
year or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, there's no evidence of
anything specific to hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that do attack hemp are all,
have broad host ranges and can survive
[SPEAKER_01]: just fine on the weeds and anything else
you're growing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they haven't targeted our cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got unlucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know yet because we haven't been
doing field surveys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been so recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's only in Alabama, at Auburn and
North Carolina State, have they done any
[SPEAKER_01]: field examination at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been doing greenhouse work to
establish susceptibility and resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: West Virginia University has done a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Florida, University of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you listeners who are looking to
get into living soil research,
[SPEAKER_00]: here are more opportunities for you,
right, to do this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's one thing I did want to
mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may sound, I don't know how it
sounds, but one of the things that hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: growers could do if, I'm assuming that
eventually, if not already, there will be
[SPEAKER_01]: state associations of cannabis producers
and interested in protecting their markets
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that is done a lot for
commodities, especially the soybeans and
[SPEAKER_01]: cotton, is to establish state commodity
boards that assess a small amount to each
[SPEAKER_01]: grower based on production and to provide
that money back to researchers at state or
[SPEAKER_01]: other legitimate universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's helpful too, because in the
legal outdoor world, they're all growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in different biospheres, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the biosphere for growing outdoors
where I live in the Pacific Northwest is
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly different than that in
California versus where you are in
[SPEAKER_00]: Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that kind of local research,
I think, is really important, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: with climate change and everybody's bio
region getting a little wonky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's amazing how much research you can
get done by giving a researcher a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: All he wants to feel is a little
gratitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a couple of kind of non
sequitur questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kept on coming up in the literature
that you can plant marigolds and let them
[SPEAKER_00]: go year round without cutting them to
limit nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do marigolds limit the nematodes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Marigold roots produce a substance called
patchelin that's toxic to nematodes and
[SPEAKER_01]: reduces, well, actually kill them,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it get rid of our beneficial
nematodes as well as the parasitic,
[SPEAKER_00]: or is it mostly about the parasitic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're eating those roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's another good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say that, yes, it's probably just the
plant parasites trying to feed on marigold
[SPEAKER_01]: roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe it does leach out in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do know that, and we have touted
this in the past in Tennessee too,
[SPEAKER_01]: for homeowners, small vegetable patches
where they get a lot of root, not
[SPEAKER_01]: nematode, to grow marigolds for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be hard to convince people to
broadcast, have a big field of marigolds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it would be kind of pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of like marigolds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way they smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And marigolds are really popular in
regenerative cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, many people will actually grow
marigolds and other similar ornamentals as
[SPEAKER_00]: banker or trap plants for beneficial
insects and then have those near the main
[SPEAKER_00]: body and co-planted with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all good approaches,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another question for you is that there
is a paper from 1997 that John McPartland
[SPEAKER_00]: put out that's pretty popular in the
regenerative cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he suggests that you can take a mature
cannabis plant and mash it up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent like water or something and then
strain out the plant material and then use
[SPEAKER_00]: that water enriched with cannabis
essential botanicals as a foliar and a
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drench, which will discourage nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things that frustrates a
lot of us about that paper is that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't say like where in the cannabis
life and if there's only certain parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and or what the active
ingredient might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty limited in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was wondering if that, you know,
did that that tickle your brain in any
[SPEAKER_00]: place where that makes sense to you that
that, you know, parts of the the resin or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even the plant material of the
cannabis plant itself might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: discouragement to nematodes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recall John's paper offhand,
but a lot of this research has been done
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly in India where they've used
different extracts of of leaves or roots
[SPEAKER_01]: or the whole plant and then applied it to
in experimental conditions to see whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it whether it kills nematodes or causes
them to become immobilized or has some
[SPEAKER_01]: negative effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not aware that I'd not sure how
spraying on the leaves would help,
[SPEAKER_01]: but but using as a root drench seems to
have some effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm just thinking off, you know,
thinking back to the the Indian papers
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read, which is where this research
has been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results I saw on the papers looked
like, yeah, that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that can be done,
though, is is simply once the once they've
[SPEAKER_01]: been harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'm I'm in the nematode
infection business, so I'm not even all
[SPEAKER_01]: that familiar with how hemp is harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it cut and then hung to dry and then
the flowers are harvested?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, you only use the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the rest of that material and plow it
back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This works for a lot of different crops,
just even just for the sake of adding more
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe there are there are
substances in the leaves and stems that
[SPEAKER_01]: probably that have some kind of effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there are there are smaller
varieties of trichomes on many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stems that that contain the same resins as
the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, we know that does all
sorts of anti antifungal antibacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: anti inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that wouldn't surprise me if that those
were playing a role as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with the natural farming is
is really popular and increasing in
[SPEAKER_00]: popularity in cannabis and and
specifically the variety known as Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the one of the applications of
of this system that we're talking about is
[SPEAKER_00]: that regenerative farmers are taking the
plant material and they're making a
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented plant juice by by taking equal
parts plant matter and sugar and in a
[SPEAKER_00]: closed jar and then just letting the plant
material break down in the sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sugars then create like an incubation,
an incubation environment for those key
[SPEAKER_00]: botanicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you spray it at like,
you know, one five hundred both foliarly
[SPEAKER_00]: and then as a root drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it's the same kind of
experience, but makes it more shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe that maybe that helps to turn
your foliar pathogens to again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really familiar with that
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like the kind of kind of
experiments that citizen scientists do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just trying things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I it would it would be really good to
formalize some of those things and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually try them in experimental
conditions where they can be where they
[SPEAKER_01]: can be sure they're working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've already we've already established
that, you know, as long as we keep our our
[SPEAKER_00]: soil in balance, we don't you know,
the likelihood that we're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with parasitic nematodes is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the the literature has mentioned
a few times this this essentially taking
[SPEAKER_00]: chitin and turning it into a powder into
something that looks like it's pronounced
[SPEAKER_00]: cheetah sun and and kind of say kind of
sand kind of sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and because supposedly the the the
nematodes do not like rubbing against it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's scratchy for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that you see deployed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not I've not heard that reason for
why nematodes don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but what we think is going on is that
chitin is a good food source for certain
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi that that attack nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and they will colonize that chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And supposedly here's the reason why the
the fungi live in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are nematode trapping fungi,
nematodes with sticky spores and all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at pretty low levels most of the
time because we have this soil stasis
[SPEAKER_01]: where everything just kind of stays where
it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a good is a good food source
for these these these fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they will colonize that and the
numbers will increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nematode gets comes along gets caught.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the idea behind doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know of a whole lot of recent
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big flurry of this back in the
80s and 90s because producers of shrimp
[SPEAKER_01]: products were overwhelmed by giant piles
of shrimp shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we going to do with this
material?
[SPEAKER_01]: So grind it up because it's all chitin,
mix it into the soil and see what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does reduce nematode numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount that and it may be that this
process has become really refined,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the amounts back then per acre were
like six to eight tons per acre to see an
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But putting in that against nematodes,
but putting that amount also sometimes led
[SPEAKER_01]: to phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there may be more recent research
that gets around that, but that's my
[SPEAKER_01]: current understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like this this kind of illustrates
the difference between sometimes like like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's there is established science and
then there's what we call in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro science, which essentially myth and
unsubstantiated rumor that we learned from
[SPEAKER_00]: our mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our entire scene is going through a
replacement of bro science, which which
[SPEAKER_00]: for most of us, we're very emotionally
connected to me me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but as we get more educated,
we learn that some of the things we've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned from our mentors or or forums or
magazines when during the Prohibition era,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's you know, it doesn't it doesn't
hold up to science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and where where I learned about,
you know, the idea that the chitin,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, scraped the nematodes on the
outside was was forums, a forum for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were comparing it to diatomaceous
earth, which which is used for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, for example, you put diatomaceous
earth around your plant, and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: discourage slugs because they don't like
to crawl across it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so it's funny because, you know,
that being the, you know, the reason I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave for to use it got a chuckle out of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you went ahead and explained the
actual science, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: feed feed the parasitic nematode predator,
which is which is, you know, an entire do
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different approach, but actually
makes a whole lot more scientific sense
[SPEAKER_01]: with a flip side of, let's say,
traditional approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: They that that have been used for so many
years is that a lot of those are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have threads of real threads of value in
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that making that connection in the
various states, getting scientists to hear
[SPEAKER_01]: about these things can promote some
useful, useful research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there there are probably there,
I'm sure, there are many longtime cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: growers who who grow beautiful cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just have the knack or the feel for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have we had a person working here for
us at the University of Tennessee in our
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse, who I knew one time I just
said she's a hemp whisperer because she
[SPEAKER_01]: knew just seemed to know instinctively how
to grow beautiful, tall hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: She grew hemp 10 feet tall in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't treat it for insects away to
get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, she was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and it wasn't that she went through a
long course of study.
[SPEAKER_01]: She just had a feel for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that I think that humans
have recognized that for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: People having a green thumb, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you can you can get to that
skill by education or good mentoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people just seem to have the
natural vibration for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and I consider them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider that a talent, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so let's finish off with this kind of
an odd question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, you know, can these nematodes,
can any of the nematodes that we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to find around our cannabis cause us harm?
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, you know, the literature talks
about hookworm, roundworm, whipworm,
[SPEAKER_00]: these different nematodes that can,
you know, actually get into the human body
[SPEAKER_00]: and cause us grief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the our our our soils,
you know, both outdoors and in the pots
[SPEAKER_00]: are filled with such variety of species,
just like we have to be careful with
[SPEAKER_00]: splashing our soil while we're watering
our plants because we don't want it
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily to splash to an adjoining
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to be aware of the possibility
of giving a nematode access to our human
[SPEAKER_00]: while we're working with soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of us work ungloved pretty
intimately with the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the chances are extremely remote.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only one you mentioned that I would be
concerned with in this country,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be hookworm and hookworm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have only if you have if
you have pets, especially dogs around that
[SPEAKER_01]: are defecating on the grounds and you're
stepping in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's you know, there was a it was
a major problem in the south over a
[SPEAKER_01]: century ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we lecture quite a bit of that in my
class on hookworm and and and how it was
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually brought under control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as these other parasites go,
unless you are handling soil that has the
[SPEAKER_01]: eggs of the nematode and then putting your
hands in your mouth, you are highly,
[SPEAKER_01]: highly unlikely to get an infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you avoid intestinal roundworms is
to make sure that you are buying produce
[SPEAKER_01]: that's thoroughly cleaned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this country, we don't have much of
a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do see infections sometimes around
where there are there's animal waste
[SPEAKER_01]: flowing down into a field, occasionally
out of other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people who are resident of those
countries sometimes have really serious
[SPEAKER_01]: infections here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if anyone ever starts getting severe
intestinal pains, they should see their
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it does exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like, you know, keep your
keep your grow area clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash your hands and keep your hands out of
your mouth you heathen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've handled I've handled soil all my
life, my bare hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wear gloves only if it's there's
something I'm mixing up and never never as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as I know, I don't have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, well, Dr. Bernard, thank you so much
for taking your time out of your very busy
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule to hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's I said in the introduction
to the show that it was it was very
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging to find a nematologist who was
well, a I could even I could even make
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with but who was also open and
interested in speaking about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there was this kind of like
general idea that there's just not a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the research has been done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I really appreciate that you you
chose to step up to the plate and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there's there's all these gaps
in what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I will give it the best shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So So I appreciate your you know,
your courage in coming on the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: glad to do it and sharing your your depth
of knowledge with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and the little bit that we know about
how nematode interacts with with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're quite welcome.
