[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are at episode 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some ways, it feels like episode 104,
because before I started Shaping Fire,
[SPEAKER_01]: I recorded 54 weekly episodes for my
friends over at Gangepreneur.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this episode is number 50 of Shaping
Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shaping Fire show is in its third
year, and some folks ask me why there are
[SPEAKER_01]: only 50 episodes, which works out to about
two or so a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: The long and the short of it is that to
make a quality show, I can't just spit
[SPEAKER_01]: them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: For most of my guests, I need to read
their readers or their research or their
[SPEAKER_01]: book or bone up on some aspect of
cannabis, just so I can ask the questions
[SPEAKER_01]: that you most want to hear answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I just asked generic questions,
the show wouldn't be particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number one piece of feedback that
I get from folks is that they love my
[SPEAKER_01]: lines of questioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I make sure I take my time when
preparing a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, as an interesting side note,
I went to college on a full debate
[SPEAKER_01]: scholarship, so that's probably where the
question and answer skills come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, not only do I like to take some time
building a show, but I'm out in the field
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly learning more and meeting new
experts to bring them to you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down in California a few times a year
hearing what farmers are saying and trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to get introductions to hard people to
reach, like Caleb Inspector, who was
[SPEAKER_01]: recently on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That interview took almost a year to bring
together, but it was hella worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also run my own test garden and spend
the bulk of my time working with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: patients and caregivers, teaching them how
to use cannabis medicine and set up
[SPEAKER_01]: patient grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't pay anything, but it's the most
important part of all this to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while the podcast can now support my
basic needs through advertising,
[SPEAKER_01]: I am still doing some brand strategy and
business consulting for select clients so
[SPEAKER_01]: I can afford the occasional vacation,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think because I am involved in so many
aspects of cannabis and am not cloistered
[SPEAKER_01]: at home in the studio, that it offers you
a perspective that you won't find anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that also means this will probably
never be a weekly show, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I can finally live off the
commercials on the show, you'll notice
[SPEAKER_01]: that I still don't have any bottled salt
nutrient companies as advertisers.
[SPEAKER_01]: While most of the industry is propped up
by helping sell salts, there's no way I
[SPEAKER_01]: would take that kind of money while being
such a proponent of regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture, polyculture, and organic
cannabis farming techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing my best to walk my talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, you may have realized that I'm
doing fewer shows on cannabis business now
[SPEAKER_01]: and more about cannabis health and
technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, there are still shows about the
industry because I'm still interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: that and I'm still very much a part of
that, but you aren't going to find me
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a show about track and trace
software.
[SPEAKER_01]: The content I am producing now is much
more for hardcore cannabis enthusiasts
[SPEAKER_01]: than it is necessarily for business
owners, though I love business owners too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that I'm more interested in the
plant and the medicine than I am about
[SPEAKER_01]: spreadsheets and regulatory changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you'd expect, Shaping Fire evolves
like it would over three years of the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening to the show and
watching the videos on the YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for sending your kind messages and
following on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for recommending me to your
friends and to good hearted cannabis

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today my guest is veterinarian Dr. Gary
Richter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Richter
speak at Emerald Cup a while back and have
[SPEAKER_01]: been excited to have him on the show ever
since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary is a holistic veterinarian and
scientist with a practice in Oakland,
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: While Gary cannot legally use cannabis in
his practice, being in California means
[SPEAKER_01]: that he had to research cannabinopathic
medicine anyway just to answer the
[SPEAKER_01]: questions of pet owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has become a national expert and is a
sought after speaker and he's also a
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're gonna talk about in detail the
use of cannabis with pets and livestock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Gary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, great to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So glad you could join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start at the very basic because
we talk about cannabis medicine on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show all the time and one of the key
aspects of cannabis medicine of course is
[SPEAKER_01]: that it interacts with the human
endocannabinoid system and often when we
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about cannabis and pets, people are
often surprised that oh, an animal has an
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system too and I generally
explain to them that all mammals do to
[SPEAKER_01]: varying degrees and people are surprised
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk to people about the
endocannabinoid system and their pet,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of explaining to them how it works
for the pet instead of the human,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you go ahead and explain that to
folks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, explaining the endocannabinoid
system can get tricky even when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to explain it to medical
professionals because remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: very, very few medical professionals be
they physicians or veterinarians learned
[SPEAKER_02]: anything about the endocannabinoid system
in medical school either.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way I approach it is the
endocannabinoid system, it is a system of
[SPEAKER_02]: neurotransmitters that are present
throughout the body both in the central
[SPEAKER_02]: nervous system as well as in the rest of
the body and while we could talk for days
[SPEAKER_02]: about all of the various actions and
physiologic responses that are caused by
[SPEAKER_02]: the endocannabinoid system, the
overarching message is that the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system is designed to
promote what is called homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means balance within the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether there's some sort of
physiologic stress and illness and injury,
[SPEAKER_02]: emotional stress, the endocannabinoid
system can help balance all of that out
[SPEAKER_02]: and keep the body on an even keel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's interesting too,
the idea that the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_01]: is constantly bringing any system that is
running hot or running cold back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's interesting because
people say how can cannabis potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: help so many different things?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell folks it only really helps one
thing, it helps your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system, it's just that happens to have its
fingers in everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it's almost like when people talk
about stem cell therapy and stem cell
[SPEAKER_02]: therapy being able to treat this
incredibly wide range of medical
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions, it's because stem cells are
really at the root of what cells can do
[SPEAKER_02]: and be in the body and therefore they can
address so many different body systems and
[SPEAKER_02]: while endocannabinoids are clearly not
stem cells, it is similar in the sense
[SPEAKER_02]: that the endocannabinoid system touches
almost every system within the body and
[SPEAKER_02]: therefore there is the potential to
utilize the endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_02]: phytocannabinoids to positively affect
those systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that in many cases pet owners are
pretty darn sophisticated and with access
[SPEAKER_01]: to the internet a lot of folks are doing
their research before they even go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor's office.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was curious, when people come to your
office, and I know that you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend cannabis in your practice
because of the laws in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: but people constantly come to you asking
about it which kind of forces the question
[SPEAKER_01]: to be answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you find that people generally
already know that their pet has got an
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system or is that very
advanced for just about everybody you talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to coming in?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, I think a lot of people
that come in, while they may have seen the
[SPEAKER_02]: term endocannabinoid system somewhere
either on the internet or wherever,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't really have a firm grasp on
exactly what that means or how it applies,
[SPEAKER_02]: but what they do know is that there is the
potential for cannabis as medicine to help
[SPEAKER_02]: their pet and while many of them may not
be concerned with the specifics in the
[SPEAKER_02]: science of the why, they certainly are
concerned with what can I do to help my
[SPEAKER_02]: animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people will come to me and
they'll be talking about pets and they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: say, I understand there's this thing
called endocannabinoid deficiency and
[SPEAKER_01]: they've often read Dr. Ethan Russo's
papers about endocannabinoid deficiency in
[SPEAKER_01]: humans and they're all like, how do I tell
if my animal has got endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I usually tell them, there's not even
tests for that in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you tell them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's pretty much the long and the
short of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even for people, I mean, Ethan Russo's
paper on endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies, which is a fantastic paper,
a lot of it is speculative because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: really at the very, very early stages of
understanding the more subtle nuances of
[SPEAKER_02]: how the endocannabinoid system works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's certainly no diagnostic
testing on the veterinary side to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to measure endocannabinoid tone,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually kind of feeds into the
kind of a general theme today that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably gonna run into a bunch of times,
which is these studies haven't been done
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of the insight that you're
gonna be offering is based on kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of anecdotal evidence,
your intuition, stories that you've heard
[SPEAKER_01]: come back to you and your very experienced
hunches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you've said that you'll
point those out when they're more hunches
[SPEAKER_01]: than anything, but I think it's important
for people to realize real clearly upfront
[SPEAKER_01]: that these studies generally have not been
done, but people are asking so many of
[SPEAKER_01]: these questions that we decided to go
ahead and do an episode about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like the state of the art,
the best we know so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one other thing to mention is there's
certainly a lot more clinical data out
[SPEAKER_02]: there regarding cannabis as it affects
humans from a medical perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while clearly a person is not a dog
nor a cat, they are all complex mammals
[SPEAKER_02]: and they all have an endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we may not be able to necessarily
draw direct correlations from one to the
[SPEAKER_02]: next, there's enough similarities here to
where if we have reasonable scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: data on the human side, there is an
expectation that we would see similar
[SPEAKER_02]: effects on the veterinary side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really good clarification.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of very reasonable
similarities and jumps that we can make
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll probably be doing some of that
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all right, so now that people generally
have an idea of what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with in the animals that we're
talking about today, I have taken the
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of animals and topics that people
ask me about most often and let's go
[SPEAKER_01]: through them over the next hour or so and
talk about each so that whoever's
[SPEAKER_01]: listening, their particular animal with
that particular issue will hopefully come
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by far, most everybody is talking to
me about their cats and dogs and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring that's probably the same for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number one question I get is my
domestic pet is getting old and their
[SPEAKER_01]: joints or arthritis or they're just not,
they don't have the same get up and go
[SPEAKER_01]: because it hurts for them to get up and
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are asking me, all right,
so they often come to me for the CBD and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we often talk about THC instead for
the anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people are talking to you about
simple joint pain for a house,
[SPEAKER_01]: pet, what kind of guidance do you give
them or what kind of perspective do you
[SPEAKER_01]: set them up with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as it pertains to cannabis,
that happens to be one of the areas where
[SPEAKER_02]: we do have a little bit of scientific data
on the veterinary side.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a study that was published last
year out of Cornell that looked at using
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD to treat arthritis, pain and dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they found was is that CBD was in
fact effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: At controlling arthritis, pain and dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is, as I say, it's one of the few
areas where we actually have some real
[SPEAKER_02]: data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps the bigger question or at least
the other question is, okay, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: if CBD is effective, what about THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about other cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is something that we really don't
know definitively yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although again, going back to the human
literature, we do know that THC or a
[SPEAKER_02]: combination of THC and CBD can be very,
very beneficial to treat people with pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as such, it's probably reasonable to
assume that similar things could be
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced by dogs and cats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trick to all of this, of course,
is what product and what dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the rubber hits the road,
so to speak, as it pertains to sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: veterinary medicine or human medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that, as I'm sure you
and your listeners know, really plays a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge bearing on the effect of any kind of
cannabis preparation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The varying either amounts or ratios of
cannabinoids, terpenes, what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really where we need to be
looking and where we need to be focusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I often wish that I could speak to
these dogs and cats that people come to me
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they say, oh, we've got our dog
and we gave it just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC-based tincture because it had joint
pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were hoping for the inflammation to
go down enough that the dog can,
[SPEAKER_01]: heck, sometimes just go outside to
defecate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people will give their animal just
a little bit of THC, maybe a milligram
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a milligram and a half, a very,
very small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the dog will get up and kind of
lumber around and seem like it's in good
[SPEAKER_01]: spirits and step out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always curious to know whether or
not, is this the dog experiencing muscle
[SPEAKER_01]: relaxation and less tension of the muscles
and less inflammation somehow in the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just that the dog somehow is
experiencing a pleasant cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: experience like so many of us have,
which kind of changed their mood and
[SPEAKER_01]: caused them to get up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we try to anthropomorphize their
actions and it's so important what the
[SPEAKER_01]: motivation of the actions are when we're
talking about dosing humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the doses are so much more sensitive
and lower for an animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it very challenging to come up
since there's no studies yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it is very challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing that we do know with dogs in
particular is that dogs actually have a
[SPEAKER_02]: greater number and a greater concentration
of CB1 receptors in their brain stem than
[SPEAKER_02]: do people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as such, they are much more sensitive
to the potential toxic effects of THC than
[SPEAKER_02]: would be a human on a sort of on a per
weight basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that means is that we do have to
be very, very cautious with the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: THC a dog gets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you mentioned like a half a milligram
or one milligram of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it kind of depends on the size of the
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, for a medium to a large
size dog, probably a milligram of THC is
[SPEAKER_02]: not going to have any outward effects in a
negative sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the dog's not gonna be high.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog's not gonna be experiencing THC
toxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that said, it's possible that even at
that low dose, that amount of THC could be
[SPEAKER_02]: providing some pain relief, could be
providing some relaxation.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you say, I mean, it's very difficult to
get any kind of direct feedback from a
[SPEAKER_02]: veterinary patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all we really have to go on is how
they're acting, how they're moving around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because from the dog's perspective,
there is no placebo effect here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now certainly, as a human perceptual
issue, we may read things into it that
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, you know, that has a placebo
effect in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if the dog is
unquestionably doing things that it
[SPEAKER_02]: otherwise wasn't doing, the only
explanation for that is because they feel
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, kind of to relate that
to the humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talk about this often on the show
where people are experiencing,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they're looking for relief from
something, but they really don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: experience any level of THC, euphoria,
or intoxication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we always tell people to take 2.5
milligrams four times a day, and you may
[SPEAKER_01]: never feel it, but it's still at those
clinical doses, still causing muscle
[SPEAKER_01]: relaxation and causing anti-inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not a high enough dose that
you're getting anything in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's exactly what you're
describing for the veterinary patients as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, that's very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I speak to groups of pet
owners or groups of veterinarians,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I very frequently tell them that
it is, just like with a person,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is absolutely possible to put an animal
on THC and have them not be high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a function of understanding how
many milligrams you're giving relative to
[SPEAKER_02]: the body weight and or species of the
particular animal that you're treating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to go along with that, you know,
therapeutic dosing, so doses of,
[SPEAKER_02]: say, THC that have a positive effect,
medically speaking, do not have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of space in the therapeutic
dosing window that are well below whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: would cause psychoactivity in a human or
an animal, and you can still get benefit
[SPEAKER_02]: from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look at all these people that are
out there that are functioning members of
[SPEAKER_02]: society that rely on cannabis,
you know, to get through their day because
[SPEAKER_02]: they have pain or anxiety or whatever it
is that they may have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those people are not walking
around high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just that, you know,
like with any medication, you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what you're giving and what
doses you're giving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important, too, to point out
that while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, how do I want to go into this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'm going to start with the
anecdotes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the course of my life of using
cannabis, I have been in the presence of
[SPEAKER_01]: other people who have had pets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at some point, they got the the the
pet high, you know, by blowing smoke in
[SPEAKER_01]: their ear or whatever that, you know,
I've seen happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and at some point, the pet decided
that it liked it so that so that when I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: over at their house and and they light up
the the let's say a dog, the dog hears the
[SPEAKER_01]: lighter and so the dog comes in the room
and is kind of begging for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always found that to be really
extraordinary, both because I did not
[SPEAKER_01]: think it was fun or funny to dose an
unsuspecting animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since it had already been done and I
was there and the animal seemed to want
[SPEAKER_01]: more, I found that to be a rather
interesting data point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any feedback from your your
patients and their owners about pets that
[SPEAKER_01]: have acquired a desire for more of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's honestly that's not
something that I've really come across.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, you know, I feel pretty
strongly that that, you know, that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of activity, like intentionally
blowing smoke in your dog's face or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's that's not OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, that that borders on animal
abuse, you know, partially because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, these animals are not equipped
nor aware of what's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a psychoactivity standpoint,
and also because, you know what I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: inhaling smoke is not necessarily good for
anybody and it's certainly not good for
[SPEAKER_02]: dogs and cats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you know, and if if if cannabis as
medicine is something that they benefit
[SPEAKER_02]: from and one could speculate, you know
what, if that individual dog seems to seek
[SPEAKER_02]: it out, maybe there's something that dog
is getting from it, medically speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe something hurts less or
maybe they just generally feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's the case, then then,
you know, that's what happens when it's
[SPEAKER_02]: time to investigate a more responsible use
of medical cannabis rather than what I
[SPEAKER_02]: would what I would describe as
irresponsible use of recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we talked a little bit about the
potentiality for the use of both CBD and
[SPEAKER_01]: THC to decrease, you know, pain and joint
pain, just general body aches of a of a
[SPEAKER_01]: older domestic pet.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have started writing online that
they're using CBD to rebalance the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system so their pets don't
have allergies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I've never run into this with an
animal before, so I don't know how I would
[SPEAKER_01]: know that my pet has an allergy and what
it's to and then to choose to treat it
[SPEAKER_01]: with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what do you what do you have in that
category?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, of all of the things that I've
seen animals benefit from cannabis for,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, allergies is not it's not at the
top of the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, as as we have
mentioned, I mean, cannabis in its in its
[SPEAKER_02]: many forms, it does have anti inflammatory
properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have sort of overall immune system
and body balancing properties by virtue of
[SPEAKER_02]: of promoting homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we discussed before, I have,
in fact, on a couple of occasions seen
[SPEAKER_02]: topical cannabis products used on animals
that seem to have helped a little bit with
[SPEAKER_02]: itching and allergies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, you know, there may be
something there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, like I say, I mean, you know,
you look at all of the various things that
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is used for, you know,
in people as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I mean, treating allergies
is, you know, is not super high on that
[SPEAKER_02]: list of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are there are there are
other options out there, both natural
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine wise and if necessary,
pharmaceutically speaking, that probably
[SPEAKER_02]: would work a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've seen for sure is when folks
will administer small amounts of THC to
[SPEAKER_01]: their, you know, domestic animal that for
for pain or something, often they will get
[SPEAKER_01]: the munchies and you can just see them go
to town on on their food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are often overjoyed because
like, oh, my gosh, the animal had had so
[SPEAKER_01]: much it was in pain and they weren't
getting a lot of movement and they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even want to go over to their food bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now suddenly there's movement and they
just totally cleaned out the bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they they kind of help bring the
pet back to health by by leaning on what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming is going to be the mere scene
in the in the THC preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen that taken place in your
practice?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not honestly convinced that
cannabis is is directly an appetite
[SPEAKER_02]: stimulant in animals like, you know,
from from like the munchies standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I think we do see is because a
lot of the animals that are receiving
[SPEAKER_02]: these medications, they're, you know,
they're not eating or they're not eating
[SPEAKER_02]: well because they don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they feel sick whether they have
an upset stomach or they're in pain or
[SPEAKER_02]: there's something else going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, I think we all know from
our own health that when you you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you feel crappy, you know,
going out and eating a bunch is not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily always, you know, your your
your first priority.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what happens with these guys
is oftentimes we see them eat better
[SPEAKER_02]: because they feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not they're not in pain
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe their stomach upset is is relieved
and therefore they're going to eat more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, like I say, I'm not I'm not
100 percent convinced it's directly
[SPEAKER_02]: appetite stimulating in the sense that
like people get the munchies.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, this is another great quest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great place that we'd love to ask them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you'd really love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ran into something new recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone using a mere scene dominant THC
tincture with their pet after surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they they had a pet that had normally
has a lot of energy and was going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: jumping around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did not want to give it
traditional I don't know, pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_01]: to dope out the animal after the surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were still concerned about the
sutures getting ripped open or just give
[SPEAKER_01]: letting them have the time to get over the
trauma of the surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they did is they they they use
this tincture and they intentionally got
[SPEAKER_01]: their dog a little high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the dog seemed fine and relaxed and
just kind of chilled out around them for
[SPEAKER_01]: the next few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, you know, then they stopped
the dosing and the dog kind of perked back
[SPEAKER_01]: up and went on its merry way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, outside of the discussion
that we've already had that you've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: be really darn careful with dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to talk more about dosing
after the break.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about, you know,
the use of of a THC tincture to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: slow down or I don't know, incapacitate an
animal so that they can get through their
[SPEAKER_01]: more important healing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a really interesting
question because because well,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, in my mind, my immediate sort of
knee jerk response was going to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what, that's a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, when I when I look at the
when I look at the kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceuticals that we typically use in
veterinary medicine for just that purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so post surgical animals to keep them
calm, to keep them from being too active
[SPEAKER_02]: after a surgery.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, effectively, that's kind of what
we're doing is we're intentionally
[SPEAKER_02]: sedating the dog or the cat or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not excessively active.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, is giving is giving say like
a pharmaceutical like trazodone,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that is that demonstrably better than
somebody giving an appropriate dose of of
[SPEAKER_02]: a, you know, a cannabis preparation with
THC and Mersene?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, I don't actually know
the answer to that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of those things that down the
road, I think research would be really
[SPEAKER_02]: fascinating to start to look at like at
like physiologic parameters like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, heart rate and respiration rate
and pain and pain response.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be really fascinating to see if
cannabis, you know, can be appropriately
[SPEAKER_02]: used in that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, clearly it is going to be
extremely difficult, if not impossible for
[SPEAKER_02]: a pet owner to get any kind of guidance in
that regards from a veterinarian.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that as you say,
that just it rolls us back around to that
[SPEAKER_02]: discussion of dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's that's
particularly important with this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular scenario, because now now we're
talking about really getting up close to
[SPEAKER_02]: the line between a therapeutic dose and
what and what would be considered a toxic
[SPEAKER_01]: dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so let's pick up this dosing
conversation after the first break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to shaping fire and my
guest today is veterinarian Dr. Gary
[SPEAKER_01]: Richter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes and custom terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes, isolated terpenes and
terpene blends are tested to the most
[SPEAKER_01]: demanding worldwide safety and stability
standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes from true terpenes are third
party tested, non GMO and food grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're triple distilled, making them the
purest terpenes available in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: With over a thousand terpene isolates,
strain profiles and terp flavors,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can be sure that true terpenes will
have the perfect aromatics for your
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes also offers custom blending
so that you can match your company's
[SPEAKER_01]: marked key strains across all your product
categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: While you can certainly simply just order
terpenes and go right to manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_01]: true terpenes also offers a wealth of
manufacturing insight, best practices and
[SPEAKER_01]: a willingness to help you break new ground
with your product formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your questions will get answered fast
and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've shopped for Terps before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the Terps that you want to add
[SPEAKER_01]: to your oil or edible or capsule or
beverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Choose true terpenes for a top shelf
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash true
terpenes to find out more or click on the
[SPEAKER_01]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is fun medicine and we love to
celebrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis connects people and creates
opportunities for new friendships.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Tok Shop, we create custom cannabis
themed jewelry, money clips, rolling trays
[SPEAKER_00]: and home furnishings that you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also make great gifts too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Ashley Villafranca, owner of the Tok
Shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to Cannabis as a patient seeking an
alternative to the pharmaceuticals being
[SPEAKER_00]: pushed at me for chronic pain and
fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that not only was cannabis a
huge help, in controlling my symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I found cannabis to be wonderfully
social too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis makes friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took my love of jewelry design and
blended it with my newfound passion for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and began hand crafting
bracelets, earrings and friendship
[SPEAKER_00]: necklaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then expanded to money clips,
rolling trays and other home furnishings,
[SPEAKER_00]: all made in sterling silver, 14 karat gold
and aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something for everyone's
budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider it all to be new age cannabis
fashion and cannabis couture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to stop by my website at the
tokshop.co.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the tokshop.co, you'll find a wide
array of attractive and fun cannabis items
[SPEAKER_00]: starting at only 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're fancy, there are very fine
luxury pieces as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always happy to do custom orders
with your name or a particular theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come check out my array of items hand
stamped with terpenes, cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabis themes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the tokshop.co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is veterinarian,
Dr. Gary Richter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we were talking about
the importance of making sure you get the
[SPEAKER_01]: dosing right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, this is true of humans as
well, because you can very easily move
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody from a dose that's going to help
them to an over-medicated dose that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have them, you know, potentially
upset for an hour or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we never want to do that with animals
because they don't know what's going on to
[SPEAKER_01]: them and they trust us to take care of
them the best way that we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's hard because most people don't
know how to even dose humans properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when they're trying to apply the
same, you know, lack of experience to
[SPEAKER_01]: their pet, things can get into trouble
real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Gary, during the first set,
you were talking about how dogs have
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten more CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have a faster uptake of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I often explain that to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the difference between taking an
edible versus hitting a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you inhale a joint, it goes to your
lungs and it goes immediately in your
[SPEAKER_01]: bloodstream and it hits you all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you feel stoned faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas when you take an edible or a
capsule, it takes a longer time to be
[SPEAKER_01]: processed through your body and it comes
on a little more slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with what you educated us about
earlier about the CB1 receptors in dogs,
[SPEAKER_01]: that tells me that we've got to be even
more careful than I thought we needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're talking to people about
figuring out dosing, what do you tell them
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're trying to weigh, like,
how do I know how many CB receptors my pet
[SPEAKER_01]: has got versus dog weight?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these are unknowns at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you help bring somebody through
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I mean, I think there's a
couple of hard and fast rules in this
[SPEAKER_02]: regards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if I were, say,
speaking with a group of pet owners or
[SPEAKER_02]: educating veterinarians on, you know,
ways that they can think about using
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in their practice, you know,
the two things that I think are important
[SPEAKER_02]: to remember as it pertains to dosing is
number one, you know, it's all about body
[SPEAKER_02]: weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the body weight of the
animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's interesting when you
look at when you look at dosing for humans
[SPEAKER_02]: very commonly in the literature,
you'll see, you know, this drug X number
[SPEAKER_02]: of milligrams per adult human male or
human female.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's so much variability in sizes
of adult dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can have a one pound Chihuahua
or a 200 pound Great Dane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so knowing how much the patient weighs
is got to be step one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And step two, as as we often say,
even when it comes to human medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is very much a start low and go slow
kind of approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we start them at we start
them at a dose that that we know is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be safe and is very unlikely to cause
any sorts of side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then slowly over time, we increase
that dose until we get to until we either
[SPEAKER_02]: get to a therapeutic effect that we're
looking for, or we've gone so high that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're now seeing side effects that we
don't like, in which case we may need to
[SPEAKER_02]: think about a different medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's important to go slow
because that, you know, if you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go step, step, step and like, let's say
that it's the fourth step where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to see adverse reaction,
you don't want to be taking big steps so
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's a big adverse reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to be very, very subtle so
that you can read your animal's body
[SPEAKER_01]: language and then realize, OK,
this is this is our threshold point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, again, it's it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you call a a a small step?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about increases of like a
half a milligram?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, I mean, you know,
it's hard to say on a per milligram basis
[SPEAKER_02]: because it depends on the size of the
animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I might look a little bit
more from a percentage increase rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than per milligram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so probably, you know,
a safe thing to start with would maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: like like a 20 percent increase on a
weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, what people need to kind of
look out for is if if as they're ramping
[SPEAKER_02]: that dose of if they give if they give an
increased dose and and the pet looks,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they look a little glassy eye,
they look a little out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sort of staring off into space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then probably that means we need to back
off the dose somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Gary, one of the things, you know,
that that everybody wants to know is the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact dosage that they need to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is difficult, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nobody wants to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and when I when I when I read places,
they don't want to go to that level of
[SPEAKER_01]: detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've already spoken real clearly that
there are variations between a smaller pet
[SPEAKER_01]: and a larger pet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but there's got to be some algorithm
where we can get people to start because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to do it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so what do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I mean, that that is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is that is invariably one of the
questions that almost all people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at cannabis for animals have and
quite rightly so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, to start with, as it
pertains to dosing, to start with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll start with that because we
actually do have some some research
[SPEAKER_02]: information here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The study that I was mentioning a little
bit earlier that came out of Cornell
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at dogs with arthritis,
as well as another study that came out of
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado State University looking at dogs
with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So treating seizures with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those studies looked at dosages
approximately of two milligrams of CBD per
[SPEAKER_02]: kilogram.
[SPEAKER_02]: A kilogram of body weight twice daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, as a doctor, all of our we
sort of think in terms of milligrams per
[SPEAKER_02]: kilogram when it comes to dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what that really translates to in
plain English is about a milligram of CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: per pound of body weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, if you have a 10 pound
dog, you're talking about give or take
[SPEAKER_02]: about 10 milligrams of CBD twice a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, mind you, if you're if you're
familiar at all with with with with CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: dosing, that dose may strike you as high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and and in truth, when I saw these
studies initially, I kind of find that
[SPEAKER_02]: found that dose seemingly a little on the
high side as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen a lot of animals do very well
on much lower dosages of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may be that that that even
significantly lower dosages can be
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but as you know, you know,
the the the margin of safety for CBD is
[SPEAKER_02]: like a mile wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so you don't you don't have a lot of
concern there from the standpoint of
[SPEAKER_02]: overdose, toxicity, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, clearly, that's not the case when it
comes to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me preface this by saying that the
dosing that I'm about to discuss is is is
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately not based on any scientific
research at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a combination of extrapolation
from human research.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I have seen work well in pets reports
that I've got and from from other
[SPEAKER_02]: veterinarians, from other medical
professionals, etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's I think it's a reasonably
good guideline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guideline from the standpoint of
starting a THC dose for a dog or a cat is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be approximately point zero five
milligrams per kilogram twice a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's zero point zero five milligrams
per kilogram of body weight twice a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, in plain English, what that what
that's going to translate to is about a
[SPEAKER_02]: quarter of a milligram per 10 pounds of
body weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have, for example, a 40 pound
dog, you might think about starting with a
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram of THC twice a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and as we discussed, you know,
you can sort of slowly ramp up from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that should be a reasonably safe place
to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Gary, of course, that brings us to how
do we actually get the dose into the
[SPEAKER_01]: animal?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, often I will recommend to pet
owners to to use an alcohol based tincture
[SPEAKER_01]: because that goes through the skin so
easily and following the the the analytics
[SPEAKER_01]: on the label to dose them the proper
amount on the skin under the fur on the
[SPEAKER_01]: back of the neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard some people do that same
technique, but they'll do it with the ear
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's got, you know, very soft
membranes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in your role, you are constantly
teaching people how to give their pets,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, capsules or liquids or whatever
they normally need to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you how do you advise people to
actually get the get the cannabinoids into
[SPEAKER_01]: the animal, which which who won't
necessarily recognize it as food?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I am I'm a big proponent of
of cannabis infused oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like them for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first reason is, is whenever you're
administering a liquid, you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: leeway as far as as far as dosing goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, as we were discussing
earlier, you know, if we're going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: with these sort of start low and go slow
theory and we're going to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, you know, increase by,
say, 20 percent each week.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to do that with a liquid,
it's quite easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to do it with some
something that looks like a food item like
[SPEAKER_02]: a dog biscuit or something, you know,
20 percent can be tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's hard to break those things
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Into, you know, into sort of even
portions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also do like to give the oils
directly orally with the intent that
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully we're going to get a certain
amount of transmucosal absorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: So absorption into the bloodstream
directly through the mouth even prior to
[SPEAKER_02]: that medication being swallowed and
ultimately digested and absorbed through
[SPEAKER_02]: the gastrointestinal tract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think I think oral
administration is is is certainly my
[SPEAKER_02]: preferred method just to address what you
were speaking about before, what I would
[SPEAKER_02]: call trans dermal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So putting it on the skin with the intent
of being systemically absorbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have an enormous amount of
information about the efficacy of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can tell you that the aforementioned
study from Colorado State University
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at epileptic dogs also looked at
rates of absorption of various methods of
[SPEAKER_02]: administration of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found that the trans dermal
absorption was the most poorly absorbed
[SPEAKER_02]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so at least preliminarily, it may be
that that, you know, that cannabis is not
[SPEAKER_02]: is not super well absorbed in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if nothing else, you know,
one thing that I can say really just from
[SPEAKER_02]: my experience with other trans dermal
medications that are used in veterinary
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine is that best absorption is is
unpredictable from one individual to the
[SPEAKER_02]: next.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little bit hard to tell how much
is actually getting in the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are recommending oral and and if
I understand your vocabulary correctly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't really want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, clearly we don't want to do like
a preset dosed biscuit dog biscuit or
[SPEAKER_01]: something or animal whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but we do want to use an oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're also saying don't take a pre
measured amount of that oil and apply it
[SPEAKER_01]: to the dog biscuit you regularly give
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're saying just put the oil in
their mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think in a perfect world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, I mean, that's all well and
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, if if an animal is just bottom
line, not amenable to being medicated that
[SPEAKER_02]: way, then by all means, feed it to them,
put it on food, put it on a treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, you know, it's, you know,
these things are not it's not black or
[SPEAKER_02]: white.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think if we're looking for the
most efficient means of absorption,
[SPEAKER_02]: directly orally is probably a good way to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and I think that that,
you know, I think that that speaks a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit to the conversation of,
of if you get the right preparation for
[SPEAKER_02]: the individual, dosing becomes really
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because let's say that if I'm going to
dose some given dog, and based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration of the medicine that I have,
the doses two or three drops of oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can put those drops of oil on my finger
and just lift up a lip, rub it on his gums
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you know, if you get the
right preparation and you have to give
[SPEAKER_02]: like three teaspoons of oil, then yeah,
that's going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always important, I think,
when when just just like interacting with
[SPEAKER_01]: human patients, when you have an animal
patient, they have got a life experience
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and we want to make sure that we
create a a healthy experience for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't want to resist being handled
and medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and who knows, you might have an
experience like we talked about earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the animal realizes that after I get
rubbed with this oil on my gums,
[SPEAKER_01]: my pain decreases, they may end up being
like all in like I'm in favor of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that that may in fact be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one part where it may not work out as
well as we want it to is is is while dogs
[SPEAKER_02]: and cats are certainly very attuned to a
cause and effect relationship,
[SPEAKER_02]: it may be that the effect is far enough
down the road from the cause that they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't connect the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if they don't feel better for
like a half hour, they may not connect
[SPEAKER_02]: that to when we put it in their mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's let's take this to the far end of
the scale, right, because at the far end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the scale, we've got animals with
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the for folks who do not
understand what a typical human cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: protocol is, it's taking 60 grams or or
technically milliliters of of this
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis oil, commonly known as Rick
Simpson oil or ethanol hash oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially, it's a it's an ethanol
extraction of the oil from the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: very concentrated and and a human will
take 60 milliliters of this over 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is an extraordinary amount of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just about all the patients find that
they sleep through the majority of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time because it's so it makes you so
lethargic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are certainly people who
will be taking these high dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and it actually is a buoy to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they're actually feeling better and
more light hearted and they don't sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that's really uncommon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, people are lethargic and and
they sleep most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is that when people are
getting up, they when they're titrating up
[SPEAKER_01]: and going to a higher higher dose every
third or fourth day, sometimes you get
[SPEAKER_01]: nausea from the higher dose or or like any
kind of dysphoria that people will
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes have when they take too much
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people will say, OK, I know that I
that that humans are taking a THC
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation for cancer and my dog has got
a tumor or some other form of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to do that for my dog,
too, because they have an endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the problem, though, is that when
you're working with a patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: the patient is giving you very clear
feedback about how they're feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are dealing with high dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that feedback is incredibly important
when we're doing this with our our house
[SPEAKER_01]: pet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are way closer to cannabinoid toxicity
levels by trying to do in high enough dose
[SPEAKER_01]: that is actually acting as a as a cancer
cure, because this is way more of a dose
[SPEAKER_01]: than just helping them with joint pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the but the animal can't give us
really quality feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to know if they are getting paranoid
or getting upset or getting nauseous or
[SPEAKER_01]: any of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes for a very difficult
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet I'm regularly hearing from people
who are buying syringes of ethanol hash
[SPEAKER_01]: oil, putting it in capsules and giving it
to their animal to try to help with their
[SPEAKER_01]: tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there are so many ways for
this to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: What has been your experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that is that is an accurate
statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many ways for this to go
badly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, first of all, if anybody you
know, if anybody has ever had the
[SPEAKER_02]: experience of of eating too many edibles,
you know, you can start to get an idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: of what kind of effects that we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, overindulging on edibles
is not a good time for anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've ever seen a person on one of
these cannabis protocols for cancer,
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you that it is brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not fun for these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if it's something that as a human,
if that's what you've signed up for,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you've made that decision and you
understand why you feel the way that you
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That said, we cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't do that with animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I mean, you know,
there's a couple of things to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, in that regards.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, you know, just just from a
from an oncology perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a cancer treatment perspective,
you know, there's a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_02]: different philosophy when it comes to when
it comes to animals versus people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, if a person has cancer
and and they go to their oncologist,
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially, their oncologist's mission is
to keep their patient alive no matter
[SPEAKER_02]: what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes that means damn near
poisoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then to death in the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to veterinary patients,
when it comes to animals, nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_02]: put an animal through that kind of
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as such, the goals of of of oncology
when it comes to animals is not to
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve life at all costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is to preserve quality of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's the first thing that we
have to we have to really sort of pay very
[SPEAKER_02]: close attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is is you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and just like with people,
you know, a lot of pets, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to ultimately succumb to cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best thing that we can do for
these animals is to give them good quality
[SPEAKER_02]: of life for as long as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having them uncomfortably stoned out of
their minds for the last weeks or months
[SPEAKER_02]: of their life is is is really is really
not a good way to go to speak to the
[SPEAKER_02]: specific preparation s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot of people out there
that are buying Rick Simpson oil and other
[SPEAKER_02]: sorts of super concentrated cannabis oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would highly, highly advise against
giving any of those products to animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I say that is because
those products are so concentrated that it
[SPEAKER_02]: is functionally impossible to accurately
dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked a little bit earlier about
dosing on a on a milligram per kilogram of
[SPEAKER_02]: body weight basis or a milligram per pound
of body weight basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you're talking about
something like Rick Simpson oil that is so
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrated that a grain of rice 10,
20, 50 milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's say your dog's dose is one
milligram of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way you're going to be able to
sort of accurately dose that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and, you know, again, from a from a
doctor's perspective, a grain of rice is
[SPEAKER_02]: not a dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, I mean, you know,
my you know, my immediate thought is
[SPEAKER_02]: always like, what kind of rice is it long
grain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it short grain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it basmati rice?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't you can't you can't dose
medicine in this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're going to call if you're
going to call cannabis powerful medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: which it is, then we need to treat it in
the in the same way that we would any
[SPEAKER_02]: other, you know, any other powerful and
effective medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to kind of just sort of bring this in
for a landing, I guess, as it pertains to
[SPEAKER_02]: dosing cannabis for cancer, oftentimes the
goal with these animals is to ramp them up
[SPEAKER_02]: to the highest dose that we can get them
on and have them still feel OK and feel
[SPEAKER_02]: functional.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, remember that just like with
people, dogs will develop a tolerance to
[SPEAKER_02]: the psychoactivity of THC over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over time, you can get them on much,
much higher doses of THC than you will be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to give them on day one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will tell you that I have seen dogs
with dogs with cancer on doses of THC that
[SPEAKER_02]: if I were to take it, I would be under the
covers for three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, they can develop a tolerance
just like people can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got to do it slowly and you really
just don't want to push it any further
[SPEAKER_02]: than they can handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Gary.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this has been a great set.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really glad to be able to get this
level of specificity on dosing all
[SPEAKER_01]: together and in one place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's time for us to take our second
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is veterinarian Dr. Gary
Richter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know that Shaping Fire has a
fabulous YouTube channel with content not
[SPEAKER_01]: found on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I attend conventions or speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_01]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has world
class speakers, including Kevin Jodry of
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderland Nursery, talking about breeding
cannabis for the best terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicholas Mahmood on regenerative and
polyculture cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history of
cannabis medicine around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben Cassidy of True Terpenes on using
terpenes for health in your everyday life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reggie Gaudino of Steep Hill on the
cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jeff Lowenfels on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even my own presentation on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_01]: high.

[SPEAKER_01]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a listener of Shaping Fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth Pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_01]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_01]: by outcompeting potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth Pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth Pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth Pea was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth Pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_01]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is veterinarian, Dr. Gary
[SPEAKER_01]: Richter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so far in the show, we have talked a
lot about your typical domestic pets,
[SPEAKER_01]: your dogs and your cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I live rurally on an
island, and a lot of you have got
[SPEAKER_01]: livestock and other types of animals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, before we wrap up today, I think it
makes sense to talk with some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Gary, let's start with really small,
non-dog and cat animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, because they don't have
endocannabinoid systems, we take lizards
[SPEAKER_01]: and snakes and things like that out
because they're not mammals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk about, for example,
bunnies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bunnies are very common and they become
pets very quickly and become house
[SPEAKER_01]: rabbits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm familiar with people using
cannabis with their bunnies as they get
[SPEAKER_01]: older and, you know, they want to help
them bring back their hop a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what do you think about small mammals
and the difference in difficulty with
[SPEAKER_01]: dosing them at such a low amount?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get to that, let me just make
the point that reptiles do have
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid systems, as far as we
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I did not know that, huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, you know, the endocannabinoid
system is fascinating in the sense that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if you look at the types of
animals that have an endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system, evolutionarily speaking,
you're going back millions and millions of
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are marine invertebrates
that have an endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, most complex animals that you
can think of have some form of an
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know, that doesn't mean
that it works exactly the same way as it
[SPEAKER_02]: would in a mammal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, from an evolutionary
standpoint, it is pretty well ingrained in
[SPEAKER_02]: the animal kingdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to get to your question about small
furry things like bunnies and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_02]: the reality is we don't really know pretty
much anything as it pertains to dosing on
[SPEAKER_02]: these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can tell you that sort of the
digestive tract and the metabolism of a
[SPEAKER_02]: rabbit or some other sort of small furry
animal like that is pretty drastically
[SPEAKER_02]: different from that of a dog or a cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's probably not applicable to just
sort of downsize the dosing accordingly
[SPEAKER_02]: per body weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as a rule, you know,
a lot of these animals are significantly
[SPEAKER_02]: more sensitive to pharmaceuticals than,
say, would be a dog or a cat on a per
[SPEAKER_02]: pound basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, odds are the dosing is actually going
to be lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then people might think, you know,
I think from a safety perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if somebody had like an
arthritic bunny or a bunny that had like
[SPEAKER_02]: back issues or something, they could try a
little CBD, I think quite safely and see
[SPEAKER_02]: if that helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not aware of any medical issues that
have come up as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: With regards to something like THC,
like I say, I mean, there's just no
[SPEAKER_02]: information out there to even have a clue
about where to start from a dosing
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's go the other direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I live on an island that is very
equestrian heavy and there are horses
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere and people see THC and CBD
being used in other animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, they're looking to deploy THC for,
you know, for injury, for everything we
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much discussed talking about using
it for dogs and cats earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they're starting to cross apply to
horses and people are starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment with high doses of CBD to keep
horses calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are huge animals with a pretty
significant different kind of system right
[SPEAKER_01]: down to how they process their nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on using THC and
CBD and the other novel cannabinoids on
[SPEAKER_01]: these larger livestock animals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really great question and
again, I mean, there are people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to look at those issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can tell you just, you know,
from a pharmacology standpoint,
[SPEAKER_02]: horses on a per pound basis usually take
far, far less medication to be effective
[SPEAKER_02]: than say what a dog or a cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the dosing is very likely to be a lot
lower than people would think that it
[SPEAKER_02]: would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I do know that there's some
people out there that are starting to look
[SPEAKER_02]: at the use of CBD in horses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we don't really have any published
or even very much anecdotal data out there
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as, you know, specific doses go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, certainly one thing that I would
urge extreme caution with as it pertains
[SPEAKER_02]: to THC in an animal like a horse is,
you know, potentially causing even milder
[SPEAKER_02]: THC toxicity in a horse I could foresee as
being a very, very concerning thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, from the standpoint of,
you know, horses as you probably are aware
[SPEAKER_02]: are fairly fragile creatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if a horse would,
you know, got a little too much THC and
[SPEAKER_02]: lost their footing and fell, I mean,
that literally could be a life-ending
[SPEAKER_02]: event for a horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's something I would
certainly urge extreme caution and if
[SPEAKER_02]: people, you know, if there's horse people
out there you know, they may actually have
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit more information than I do
because that's not really so much the
[SPEAKER_02]: world that I live in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I would definitely urge
extreme caution and taking things very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only could it potentially put the
horse or other livestock at risk,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also, I mean, we all know how
dangerous a horse can be when it is
[SPEAKER_01]: spooked or ornery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's having this experience that
it's never had before and it's feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: unsafe, wow, it could hurt the people
around it and it could hurt itself against
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are nearby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, you know, I'm not going to
say that it's something that should never
[SPEAKER_02]: be done because, again, it's a little out
of my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, it's something that should be
done under veterinary guidance and very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point for us to say,
you know, we're pulling so much of our
[SPEAKER_01]: experience from anecdotes and from
personal experience of people doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: on the animals that tend to be most
commonly in our lives, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dogs and cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we work our way out to smaller
animals like rabbits and larger animals
[SPEAKER_01]: like horses and cattle, the number of data
points that we have even anecdotally get
[SPEAKER_01]: less and less and less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're working with animals at
either end of the scale, don't think that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can just take the dog or cat dosing
algorithm and just apply it to these other
[SPEAKER_01]: animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's have let's have a little
discussion about topicals for these
[SPEAKER_01]: animals, because topicals are nice because
they generally keep the dosing pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly CBD topicals for psoriasis
and dermatitis and these these other types
[SPEAKER_01]: of skin issues certainly are great for
animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question, which is pretty basic,
is how do you use a topical with an animal
[SPEAKER_01]: with fur?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's tricky for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fur is certainly one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if there was an area of
skin that that seemed like it really
[SPEAKER_02]: warrants a topical, then it may be that
that area needs to be shaved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise, I mean, I think,
you know, I think a topical would be would
[SPEAKER_02]: be difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen some products out there that
are essentially just alcohol extracts that
[SPEAKER_02]: are that are packaged as a spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may be that, you know, you might be
able to, you know, get good skin contact
[SPEAKER_02]: with a spray, even without shaving.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and there are certainly
endocannabinoid receptors in the skin and
[SPEAKER_02]: the hair follicles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I think there's absolutely
medical application there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flip side of it, the other thing that
we have to be concerned about is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what, anything that you put on an
animal's skin is likely to get licked off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a real issue, particularly if
you're talking about a topical product
[SPEAKER_02]: that has THC in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, again, now we have to think
about, well, how many milligrams of THC is
[SPEAKER_02]: this dog ingesting because they're licking
this stuff off?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that a concern from a from a
toxicity standpoint?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may be that if people are using
topicals, particularly ones that have THC
[SPEAKER_02]: in them, they're going to have to put
like, you know, like what we call an
[SPEAKER_02]: e-collar, like the lampshade, if you will,
something on them to prevent them from
[SPEAKER_02]: turning around and licking that stuff off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Gary, before we move on to talking a
little bit about pet nutrition,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to point out that that there's
not any quality standards that are
[SPEAKER_01]: enforced for for pet medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of folks that are in
the in the green rush that are bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid isolate products to the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we've learned with humans,
it's very important to use a whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation because these individual
molecules, say, for example, CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is short for cannabidiol,
a lot of people put out products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: just that individual molecule in some kind
of vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they suggest that it might work just
like all the studies say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet the vast majority of the studies
are all focused on whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: preparations, meaning you do a whole plant
extraction and you not only have the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabidiol there, but you also have the
other novel cannabinoids, the the the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannaflavin and all the other parts of the
cannabis plant that that are found in the
[SPEAKER_01]: in the trichome oil there also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they work together to do what's called
the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work together as a as a complex lock
that unlocks the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, unfortunately, there's a lot of
people who are bringing products to the
[SPEAKER_01]: market that are just these individual
molecule isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my question for you is,
do you find that whole plant preparations
[SPEAKER_01]: are preferred for animals just like they
are for humans?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a it's a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and, you know, that is certainly that
is certainly something that certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: something that comes up a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you say, I mean, there's a lot
of people out there that are looking to
[SPEAKER_02]: make money in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and, you know, certainly CBD isolates
are are certainly one of the things that
[SPEAKER_02]: are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I in my office, I practice what
I would describe as integrative medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning that I offer both conventional
Western care, but also holistic and
[SPEAKER_02]: natural medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and we use a lot of herbal
preparations in this office, both Western
[SPEAKER_02]: herbs, Chinese herbs, what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and as such, I am a very big fan of of
the entourage effect and of whole plant
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my experience, I find that those
products tend to work better usually than
[SPEAKER_02]: than isolated compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that this kind of plays out a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at, for example, if you look
at reports from people who are who are
[SPEAKER_02]: taking medications like Marinol,
which is synthetic tea, THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's basically just pure THC isolate
that was that was manufactured
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Molecularly speaking, it's the same THC
that you would find in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that there's nothing else there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very frequently, those people will
report that whole plant cannabis tends to
[SPEAKER_02]: work better for them than just the THC
isolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I think that I think that it
bears out that these isolate products,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, speaking in generalities,
do not work as well as a really good
[SPEAKER_02]: quality full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that's interesting about
folks, everybody and how they acquire
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid deficiency, we generally
suggest that unless you're predisposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: it, people generally get endocannabinoid
deficient from from stress and anxiety and
[SPEAKER_01]: poor sleep and poor nutrition and
environmental toxins and things that
[SPEAKER_01]: generally run the body down to a point
that it's not making its own endogenous
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids effectively anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go and supplement it with
phyto cannabinoids from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that you are an expert also on
on pet nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we're talking about a lot of
different animals today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I think that one of the key things
is that if people put the care into the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper nutrition of their animals,
that even if something goes wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: their their bodies more likely to bring
their endocannabinoid system back into
[SPEAKER_01]: balance and and and thus the other systems
back into homeostasis all on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So outside of the use of of, you know,
supplementing with cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's a perspective that you would offer
to people who care for their animals just
[SPEAKER_01]: so their nutrition is high enough that
endocannabinoid deficiency is less likely?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to speak to endocannabinoid
deficiency, specifically, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is a that is a very, very difficult,
if not impossible thing to really prove in
[SPEAKER_02]: any given individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a it's a very difficult thing to
it's a very difficult thing to quantify.
[SPEAKER_02]: That said, you know, you can't have good
health without nutrition, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: without without appropriate nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I mean, no matter no matter
what kind of supplements, no matter what
[SPEAKER_02]: form of cannabis a patient may be taking,
if they're not eating right, then they're
[SPEAKER_02]: probably not going to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, you know, I mean, that's that's
always the first conversation I have with
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody that brings their pet into my
office is is is what what ideal nutrition
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like for their pet, because that's
got to be the foundation to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so what do you is there a general
guidance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what what I'm kind of like poking at
is like, do you recommend that that people
[SPEAKER_01]: give their animals like whole foods?
[SPEAKER_01]: That they that they, you know,
go to the extents to to make them meals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is is is an animal chow sufficient?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't actually have an opinion on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious, along with probably a
lot of the listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so I am very much a proponent of fresh
whole food diets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the bottom line is,
is that no animal or no person evolved
[SPEAKER_02]: eating highly processed foods.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, you know, our bodies are not
particularly ideally equipped to to eat
[SPEAKER_02]: things out of a can or out of a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so, you know, my preference is always
to have my patients eating eating fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: whole food diets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, whether those diets are raw food
versus cooked food that that they've
[SPEAKER_02]: purchased from a company that makes it or
if they're making food at home using an
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately balanced recipe,
you know, any of those things,
[SPEAKER_02]: any of those things are fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but, you know, as is the case with all
of us, the fresher and the more whole
[SPEAKER_02]: foods they're eating, the better off
they're going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, mostly we've been talking
about using cannabinoids today as as a
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what do you think about using
cannabinoids as a preventative?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like your your animal already is healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet we know that THC prevents cancer
long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that supplementing the
endocannabinoids system with cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_01]: is generally good for health.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about giving
supplementation with cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if the patient is not presenting a
problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think what we're really talking
about here is micro dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and the truth of the matter is,
is I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that anybody really knows in
the sense of, you know, as we've
[SPEAKER_02]: discussed, I mean, we have so little
research as far as as far as use of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, using cannabis to treat known
disease, you know, using cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_02]: preventative is, you know, I mean,
I think it's I think it's an intriguing
[SPEAKER_02]: question, but I have I just have nothing
to offer by way of is that a good thing or
[SPEAKER_02]: a bad thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Dr. Gary Richter, thank you so much
for sharing some of your valuable time
[SPEAKER_01]: with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this was this is a different
kind of show for me, because I with a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of these shows since I talk and teach much
of this medicine for humans, I kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: know the answers in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was surprised time and time again
chatting with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for sharing your very unique
and hard earned knowledge and and good
[SPEAKER_01]: luck on your pursuits with with the laws
changing so that you can actually start
[SPEAKER_01]: discussing this with other veterinarians.
