[SPEAKER_01]: So Kevin, you know, you are an expert
consultant to big commercial grows all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you know how to grow
cannabis at scale, but now all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: country, the reverse is happening,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks can home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can grow four or six plants or
something so they can, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: get their hands in the soil and be more
self-sufficient with their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as somebody who helps foster these
huge grows at commercial level,
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of advice do you have for a home
grower who's going to grow their four or
[SPEAKER_01]: six plants so that they can have an
optimum experience based on your depth of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with commercial size grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't look at the commercial model
whatsoever, because that's based off of
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency for sale and production.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the individual, what you're looking
for is experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the experience is you actually
work on it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the experience of having a holistic,
healthy, organic model, if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I don't fault anybody for growing
cannabis in their closet with a single
[SPEAKER_00]: light using a one-part chemical,
because if that's the tool you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with and that's what you're limited
to afford, and that's the barrier that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to get around to be able to do it,
then that's where you begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look for the best genetics you can
get your hands on and you put the best
[SPEAKER_00]: effort you can and you put the effort in
that's required to get the result that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you go forward on this gradient from
the least resources to the most,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not about spending more and more
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about trying to spend less and less
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're someone who can do four to
six, in California, six plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to build a situation that
allows you to develop some kind of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that's self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that what you have is you have a
permaculture situation where your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: is absolutely able to give you quality
cannabis every year with almost no cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to make it as simple as
possible for you so that you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to enjoy the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And simple in this case would be to put a
watering system in and you build organic
[SPEAKER_00]: models that allow you to do very little
effort on that end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effort is applied to basically keeping
the plant healthy through cleaning and
[SPEAKER_00]: inspection and work on that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you have is you have a very
low effort, low input, high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product, because for most people that are
growing four plants, they're not using it
[SPEAKER_00]: for economic gain, six plants,
they're using it for personal use
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, family use consumption,
neighbor use consumption, because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: give away and in California you can share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that situation is a very different
direction and it allows you to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a life, have a normal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to spend 20 hours a week on
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only spending a little bit of time
on your garden to actually make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of the time you spend on your
garden is not necessary for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's necessary for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you are spiritually connected
to plant growth because I think so many of
[SPEAKER_00]: us are disconnected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think so much of home growing is so
much more than just the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you do the process, my advice to
people is once you don't have the process,
[SPEAKER_00]: put your hands in your pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't touch anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can go and sit down in the
garden and just be around the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy the terpenes that are coming off of
them that are volatizing through the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural sunlight hitting them and them
warming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the wind move them about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's indoor in your room, smell this
beautiful smell that's lighting up a stale
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's even electric light, experience
the way the plant responds to the heat of
[SPEAKER_00]: it and how the plant moves in tropism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you become enthralled with this
process of plants that do all these
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible processes and never speak to
you, never ask you for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to use all these other
senses that we don't develop typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grounds you in a way that's
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start to become a really good
cultivator where you're really about what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing, you start to have this other
awareness on what you eat, on how the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth is treated in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start to have this much more human
connection and a much more spiritual
[SPEAKER_00]: connection to the actual planet you're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allows you this beautiful window
into a world that you hadn't seen prior
[SPEAKER_00]: because our lives are so rushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go and we just buy product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use cannabis to change our tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you produce the cannabis,
you're going to find you're changing your
[SPEAKER_00]: tone without ever consuming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of people, the consumption
becomes second.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the production process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for me, it's always most
important to get lost in that process,
[SPEAKER_00]: but make sure it fits your schedule so
that you're not spending your whole day
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people say,
you know, that cannabis is a gateway,
[SPEAKER_01]: but cannabis is a gateway to horticulture
because it teaches you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it opened up organic ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the organic ag revolution in
America was funded primarily by people who
[SPEAKER_00]: were in urban areas that had exceptional
monies where they could afford to make
[SPEAKER_00]: choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of us that were in cannabis
production all over the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're like, why are we feeding our
plants and building soil so well and
[SPEAKER_00]: buying supermarket food?
[SPEAKER_00]: It became this really strange paradigm of,
wait a minute, I don't put anything toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do anything bad to my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm against all these processes with my
cannabis, but I'll consume fast food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you started to see this awareness
occur with the growers where they started
[SPEAKER_00]: to realize, wait a second, I'm growing
cannabis that's far healthier than my food
[SPEAKER_00]: supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start to begin to grow your own
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also start to frequent
farmers markets so that you can support
[SPEAKER_00]: local farmers growing the food that you
know you should eat because you're so
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of the inputs on the cannabis and
how it reflects in the end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that cannabis cultivation
in the United States was so big and
[SPEAKER_00]: lucrative enough that it gave people the
disposable income to choose to go
[SPEAKER_00]: organically when prior they couldn't
because they've made organic ag so
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievably expensive in its production
methodology to get to the store and sell
[SPEAKER_00]: that it precludes regular people from
buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden there's this
massive paradigm shift in what we should
[SPEAKER_00]: consume and eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the cannabis really drove it,
but from a secret level.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one really knew what was pushing this
incredible consumption because where did
[SPEAKER_01]: the money come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: You point out that really there's only two
steps to the home growers process.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, build soil so that you don't have to
be buying all these bottled nutrients and
[SPEAKER_01]: spending all this extra money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then number two, be present with the
plants so that you can see their changes
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can talk to you and tell you
anything that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say the best fertilizer for a plant
is the growers shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's an old Chinese proverb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I buy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I totally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it is people say I'm working
10 hours a day in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what are you doing for 10 hours
a day?
[SPEAKER_00]: The garden only took an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other eight and a half hours shouldn't
be considered work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be considered leisure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But leisure in a positive way.
[SPEAKER_00]: People believe that if you're not
constantly being industrious, you're lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not really the human condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't work nonstop until basically
electric lights came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people who did work nonstop are called
slaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to be a slave to
yourself constantly grinding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you get into a cannabis
situation with plants, there's something
[SPEAKER_00]: calming from the release of the terpene
profiles that are just naturally exuding
[SPEAKER_00]: off of them in vegetative state and in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see it when I have people in gardens
where I see them relax and it changes
[SPEAKER_00]: their complete demeanor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched this for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I realized that's one of the things
that's so powerful for us is that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: allow this process, which we normally
consider work, to be something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic and healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people don't get that from their
jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis has that ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can have people that love to
grow cannabis for the other people in
[SPEAKER_00]: their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may be able to grow six plants per
parcel in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And say I grow it, but it's my girl or
other people live in my house that are the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones who consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be a small consumer, and that's not
the case with me, but it's the reality
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have people who love to grow and
cultivate cannabis like they do flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they do all forms of horticulture,
floriculture, agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not really about the
consumption on the end of it because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the process that allows it to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have to be complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The complicated part is really to
understand that living soil is about as
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated as it could possibly be
because of this incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: interrelationship between all these
different organisms that make a delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you learning how to do that over time
is this incredible experience of the human
[SPEAKER_00]: life, existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we don't get,
which is really an everyday living science
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
