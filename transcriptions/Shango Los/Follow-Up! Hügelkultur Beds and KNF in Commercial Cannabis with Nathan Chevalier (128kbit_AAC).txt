[SPEAKER_01]: So Nate, thank you so much for having me
back on your farm You know last time when
[SPEAKER_01]: we were here in the spring We just shot
that great video about your like very
[SPEAKER_01]: large hugelkultur deployment Would you
give us a reminder of the the size and
[SPEAKER_01]: general dimensions of the hugelkultur
deployment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a 6300 square feet and it's
just a small flat area the mounds or the
[SPEAKER_00]: the hills run from 25 feet up to 75 feet
long and they're about five feet wide
[SPEAKER_01]: right on like that with a two-foot walkway
in between So we talked to you in the
[SPEAKER_01]: spring, you know, this was the R&D part of
your property You've got your your proper
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses where you do other kinds of
living soil probiotic and K&F growing But
[SPEAKER_01]: who culture was like in your heart,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wanted to do this this year and and
just kind of see you know how it went and
[SPEAKER_01]: and when we last talked a lot Of your
concern was whether or not The immaturity
[SPEAKER_01]: of the hugelkultur because you had just
built them Was going to impact the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: and whether or not you were gonna get any
yield I've seen them, but I'll let you go
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead and say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did you have some success?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we did it's it's good to go
down and see the plants happy and Have
[SPEAKER_00]: some nice big buds on there It wasn't it
wasn't always like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some Some issues along the way with
drought I would say it was probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest thing that we had hit our plants
As we were digging these these hugel
[SPEAKER_00]: mounds out We we actually decided to
excavate down into the ground a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started all of our material was
saturated completely wet But this took a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot longer than we thought to get it all
done and as we were digging out replanter
[SPEAKER_00]: refilling Spreading out the materials they
were drying out and as we got to the very
[SPEAKER_00]: last one Or was actually the second to
last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We deemed it to be a little too much of a
Burden to try and get it wet enough to to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So We cut it short on the last one We're
gonna try and get it all dug out here
[SPEAKER_00]: before Before the rain hits after we
harvest here So So if you had this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: drought condition because your materials
you started with the materials wet But
[SPEAKER_01]: before you could get him in the hugel
hole, they got dry And so you were
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially packing dry holes I would
think that you probably took water and
[SPEAKER_01]: just drenched the hell out of them Is that
was that your first line of defense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was we you know going into this
whole thing it's the water conservation is
[SPEAKER_00]: the the idea behind it and The fact that
you're gonna have these really big deep
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient rich beds full of microbiology,
but It it wasn't the case going into this
[SPEAKER_00]: first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was dry unworkable no sticks And you
could see it in the plants as as the time
[SPEAKER_00]: went on in the early stages they seem like
they maybe kind of bottomed out a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit or Maybe weren't growing as fast as
they should a lot of yellow leaf from from
[SPEAKER_00]: drought conditions So, you know,
it wasn't all it wasn't all easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but actually none of it was You know every
year moving forward is gonna be Much more
[SPEAKER_00]: much easier because of what we did this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're excited about that So we were
talking about how you were gonna you know
[SPEAKER_01]: as you know You are both a cannabis farmer
and also a very much a business owner and
[SPEAKER_01]: you feel that no more than this year,
right ever before and You know you were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about like, okay You've got your
regular greenhouses and you were gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: devote X variable of resources to this R&D
project in the hoola beds but actually end
[SPEAKER_01]: up being quite a bit of resources to dig
out the holes and fill them and put the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing and You were just like,
you know I'm okay with hoola cultures for
[SPEAKER_01]: the future But it'd be really great to get
enough abundant crop to make this
[SPEAKER_01]: worthwhile and to at least be in the black
For the year right on that growing area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Would you say that you have got an
abundant enough of a crop where it was
[SPEAKER_01]: worth the overall effort?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's you know, time will tell we
have a week or so left to harvest We're
[SPEAKER_00]: just getting ready to start to pull the
first ones down It's probably gonna be two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks before the last ones come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You'll have a better idea then but I
think we're gonna be somewhere around 60%
[SPEAKER_00]: of our typical yield just a just a
ballpark But I wouldn't say that the youth
[SPEAKER_01]: of the hoola cultures Necessarily impacted
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean there are certainly some things
that you may Want to do different and
[SPEAKER_01]: better as you make your best practices But
you know, we were seeing coal is the size
[SPEAKER_01]: of your arm, you know, I mean it was it's
it's visually impressive What would you
[SPEAKER_01]: say is some aspect of it that that you're
looking to improve next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the the soil structure in the beds I
would say is the main thing we Used a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the native soil that we have down there
and would were the two main things that
[SPEAKER_00]: went into it Our native soil is very rocky
and very clay like so it's not the easiest
[SPEAKER_00]: to work so our goal over over the course
of the fall and into the winter and even
[SPEAKER_00]: into the spring is gonna be just
Continually adding layers of mulch to
[SPEAKER_00]: these beds And and get the organic matter
built up in there Get mycelium networks
[SPEAKER_00]: built up in there get microbiology built
up in there all of this through
[SPEAKER_00]: permaculture practices we're gonna be
doing some mushroom logs and Some
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's gonna be it's gonna be fun
throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to Having some
downtime from farming and concentrate on
[SPEAKER_00]: building the beds and getting everything
looking really good Yeah, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's like Excited for and looking
forward to harvest to it at least move on
[SPEAKER_01]: to different things, you know different
tasks for the day I was happy for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: see that you were able to do some food
Interplanting too because you know part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea is that that you've got your
cannabis plants up top, but you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: running You know companion plants that are
you know, you know positively Allopathic
[SPEAKER_01]: with the cannabis but also to grow some
food, you know to reap, you know Benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: from that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so how did that go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it actually was a complete mistake
this year We were in our planting or
[SPEAKER_00]: planning on doing a bunch of polycultures
and interplantings and You know making
[SPEAKER_00]: these beds You know just full of
Abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you saying that was a volunteer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are volunteer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that came up underneath was
volunteer That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's all we have pumpkin squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tabasco Down there wait,
so it was everything that was in your
[SPEAKER_01]: compost then you then used to fill the
hugel culture That starts popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually pretty cool So another one
of your goals was going to be to use as
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the nutrients both the raw
Nutrients just so you're just throwing on
[SPEAKER_01]: to amend the soil but also the inputs for
your cannabis F-ferments you're gonna try
[SPEAKER_01]: to source as much of that as possible
right here on your acreage So you can you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, keep the circle tight, how did that
go?
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good we We did a lot of harvesting
early in the year and preparing our FPJs
[SPEAKER_00]: in our FFJs maybe the fermented plant
juice and fruit juices and also we did
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff for pesticides we did a
habanero FFJ We did also our LA bees with
[SPEAKER_00]: our goat milk See That and we did a little
bit of the seawater but beyond that we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get into much of the other KNF
stuff, but that stuff we've got a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good hold on and we're getting ready to
move further on into the into the regimens
[SPEAKER_00]: and And seeing what else we can do even
outside of the ferments It seemed like you
[SPEAKER_01]: use a lot of the the bio material that was
on the property like, you know you turned
[SPEAKER_01]: me on to how rich of Forced duff is last
time I was here, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the more I look into it the more
like I realize that stuff is like soft
[SPEAKER_01]: magic, you know Yeah So so you used a lot
of that and obviously you used a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: brush because it looks like you kept on
even after you dug the hugel you kept on
[SPEAKER_01]: putting stuff on there and so the idea was
for it to break down so So what where did
[SPEAKER_01]: you source some of that stuff too?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just around anywhere we could we got
most of our forest stuff from Just off of
[SPEAKER_00]: the the full Sun flat and our homestead
flat a lot of the other stuff that went
[SPEAKER_00]: into The plant matter and the the wood
came from a PG&E extension that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on We're bringing we're bringing
power to our place and we had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: brush and tree clearing to do and we were
able to gather up all of that stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: get it down there and get that stuff in
there and feeling really good about the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ability to use that stuff up right on
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Well, thank you again for the tour
this spring because that was really not
[SPEAKER_01]: only exciting But it was really inspiring
right to see Google culture deployed in
[SPEAKER_01]: that level And thanks for having us back
to take more pictures and to chat more
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely Right on Thank you brother
Right on You You
