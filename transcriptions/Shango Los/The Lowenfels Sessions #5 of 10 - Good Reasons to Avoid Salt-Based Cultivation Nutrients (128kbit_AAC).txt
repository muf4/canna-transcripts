[SPEAKER_02]: In cannabis growing forums, there's a lot
of trash that's talked about salt-based
[SPEAKER_02]: bottled nutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: People calling out, I don't grow with
salts or I wouldn't grow with those
[SPEAKER_02]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, especially in the forums
that I frequent that are all natural
[SPEAKER_02]: growing technique related, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think a lot of people, they just,
they give these family of store-bought
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients a category without actually
understanding why.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't like them, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I hope that you would review why
folks should not consider salt-based
[SPEAKER_02]: bottled nutrients and because of how that
impacts the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, they're also salt nutrients
that are not in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's just powders that you buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I always tell this story and I have
to be a little bit careful because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to get taken to court.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I tell this story about sitting in a
garden writers meeting once and a
[SPEAKER_01]: gentleman named Horace Hagedorn came to
speak and he was the founder of Miracle
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got up and gave a talk about
Miracle Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This must have been 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every garden writer in the United
States of America used Miracle Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get free samples all the time and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was before the organic movement
really took off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before, I like to say teeming with
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, he gave this talk and he
explained how he got into the business and
[SPEAKER_01]: he explained that he graduated from the
University of Pennsylvania with a degree
[SPEAKER_01]: in advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a big tip off, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see there is all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went to work for a company in New
York that sold butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he learned about two minutes into the
job, all butter's the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put a red label or agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all graded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the same butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all comes from the same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he kept thinking about his friends who
went to work for Jolette and other places
[SPEAKER_01]: where they were having new razor blades
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he hated this job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would spend his weekends driving
around trying to straighten his head out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one weekend he came upon a greenhouse
that was growing wonderful plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he asked the guy why his plants were
so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy said, my name is Otto Stern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an invention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they decided they were going to go
into business together and try to sell the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they put it in the New York Herald
Tribune, 1952, before and after,
[SPEAKER_01]: Miracle Grow plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all seen them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made like $20,000 in the week
following Thursday, I think he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's old money too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was old money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he went into the butter company and
he said, you know, I like you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went sailing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hate this business and I quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to go in the fertilizer
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he built up Miracle Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the number one recognized
brand in the world, right up there with
[SPEAKER_01]: Coca-Cola and Pepsi, I have to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he was approached by Scotts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going to buy him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did a reverse buyout and bought
Scotts for like $350 million, he told us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he said, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all went up to get autographs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was standing in the back and he
looked up at me and he went, uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your name Llewyn Fells?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, so sorry I told that story about
the butter company.
[SPEAKER_01]: My father and grandfather owned the butter
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we became quite good friends as a
result of that talk he gave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would come up to Anchorage,
Alaska and sit in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife, Judith, arranged to have 10 or 15
gardeners come over, one an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would interview them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the ads would run on the Super
Bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if he was alive today,
he would definitely be an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would definitely see that, and now I'll
answer the question, that this stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the scientific version,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the scientific version.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, let's take the large
overview.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that ugly map that has that zone
down there by New Orleans in the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: that eutrophication.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in red, it has all the rainbow
colors, it's polluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nitrogen runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody always says it's the farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in fact, home growers, gardeners,
and home growers are certainly part of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: we use four to five times more nitrogen
than a garden, than a farmer does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're responsible for that as much as
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use a teeny little bit of it,
a teeny little bit of it hits the root,
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of it goes out into the,
wherever, and it pollutes, simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant doesn't use all of that high
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes, some of which will die,
because the stuff is so heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you took any kind of 10th grade high
school course and paid attention,
[SPEAKER_01]: which most of us didn't, in science,
you know about osmosis and diffusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens if you have a high
concentration of salts on one side and a
[SPEAKER_01]: single cell organism on the other side,
and you put them together, what happens is
[SPEAKER_01]: the single cell water leaves the single
cell, it tries to dilute the salt,
[SPEAKER_01]: salt tries to go into the single cell and
dilute the water, and you want to have an
[SPEAKER_01]: equilibrium, and you end up with sort of
an equilibrium always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always at least one molecule, I learned
when I wrote in with nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always one molecule at least off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, you end up with this
quasi-equilibrium, but you also end up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a dead microorganism, because the
cells blow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're either eating like crazy and
changing the natural concentration,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they're getting killed by the stuff,
and both of those are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now once they start to go, then you have
the entourage effect of bad effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant says, I don't need to do the
exudate thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking 50, 60% of my photosynthetic
energy to produce exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to concentrate on the flower and
not worry about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it needs to worry about that stuff,
because it's not getting what it wants,
[SPEAKER_01]: what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting nitrogen, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting phosphorus, MPK, high numbers
of it, and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it getting the little nutrients
that it needs, the micro ones that make
[SPEAKER_01]: the right enzyme, that does the right...
It's phenomenal what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, taking the nutrients,
I highly recommend, because it'll teach
[SPEAKER_01]: you what you need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens inside that cell is
influenced by what goes into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's go a couple more steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can stop me wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If ever I have to rewrite or do another
book, it'll be called More TV with
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I'm going to stick in it
is now known as Rhizophagy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know about Rhizophagy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in passing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhizophagy is something I'm really,
really fascinated by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote TV with fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, I mentioned all three books now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing how that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Links to all the books are in the
description below, so go out and buy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe me, I'm not making any money off
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: My publisher is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fungi, of course, do this wonderful
symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it turns out that now they're
discovering some of the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is what I'm trying to figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: How often does this happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the bacteria do what I talked
about in TV with Microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get eaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: The things that eat them, poop them out,
feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts a charge on it, goes into the
plant, TV with nutrients, blah,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Rhizophagy involves is a completely
different system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria is in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into the root, enters the root
through the meristead area, goes into the
[SPEAKER_01]: root, takes off its cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is oxidized by the plant cell that
strips off the nutrients it contains.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria continues to move through the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes to the side of the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates or stimulates the plant to form
a root hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root hair grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria moves through the root hair
and goes out the end of the root hair,
[SPEAKER_01]: puts its cell wall back on as it does so,
goes into the soil, gets more nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: and repeats the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's taking off its outer layer,
passing through not the root zone,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the literal root itself, and then
comes out the other side kind of reborn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up against the plasma lemma,
apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets oxidized, which pulls off the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing you know, it goes back out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is these root hairs form.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm trying to figure out,
and I've got to stop traveling enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to get on the telephone and see if
I can find the guy that wrote the papers,
[SPEAKER_01]: are these root hairs only formed as a
result of bacteria leaving?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this what this is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a system that ejects the bacteria
into itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: A new area of the soil that's different
from where the bacteria came from so that
[SPEAKER_01]: it can get its nutrients and go back into
the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, now that would be simply amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In any case, we know it does exist and
that it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very analogous to what the fungi do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give them the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting co-evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know quite what to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar to mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mycorrhizal fungi, it seems to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know a lot more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot how we got into it and what the
question was, but those guys are going out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and bringing food into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you're using those heavy,
miracle-growth type salts, that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fabulous.
Thank you very much.
