[SPEAKER_03]: When I first interviewed Kevin on my
shaping fire podcast He said with zero
[SPEAKER_03]: shame that he has been a trafficker all
his life I thought that was so cool Not
[SPEAKER_03]: only do I not hear many people use the
word trafficker But to see someone who
[SPEAKER_03]: stepped into it and owned it and was proud
of it and wrote Prohibition all the way to
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization and it is now a leader in his
community I'm like damn straight these are
[SPEAKER_03]: The kinds of things that make a hero to
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has deep roots in both Oakland and in
Humboldt County He is Prohibition era
[SPEAKER_03]: turned license and he's savvy and
successful in both He's created the most
[SPEAKER_03]: important genetics hub in the United
States in Humboldt County at his nursery
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderland nursery Not only is he wildly
successful himself, but he's become a
[SPEAKER_03]: leader in that community you know it's one
thing to be a producer and Sell your
[SPEAKER_03]: product and just generally be a good
person But then to take that and to become
[SPEAKER_03]: a leader in your community band people
together Work with policy changes work
[SPEAKER_03]: with the laws and then go and mentor new
entrepreneurs New breeders who are coming
[SPEAKER_03]: up and to fill the vacuum that he's
created Behind him so that so that there's
[SPEAKER_03]: new folks that kind of leadership is rare
in our industry For somebody who's not
[SPEAKER_03]: just trying to chase dollars He's an
all-around good guy, and I consider it a
[SPEAKER_03]: privilege to be his friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm honored to present Kevin
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I follow what you guys doing It's awesome
that you as a community get together and
[SPEAKER_01]: work on cannabis and cultural stuff and
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's I'll say a losing element in our
society.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really we're becoming very small
minority Cultivators spiritual
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators, so thank you so much for
letting me come here My conversations
[SPEAKER_01]: typically are on that though typically
people bring me in to talk about a
[SPEAKER_01]: direction a thing my Success is in
survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've successfully been in cannabis since I
was 12 years old and I've had this an
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievably long story life of cannabis
But here with this very different time
[SPEAKER_01]: period where all of a sudden cannabis is
no longer cannabis cannabis became
[SPEAKER_01]: business Cannabis is the culture And we
have the product but the product is a
[SPEAKER_01]: business and then this is this is this
discussion that I want to have tonight is
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to talk about turpines in a
little different manner because you've had
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Russo speak to you who is by what I
consider the State of the art of the
[SPEAKER_01]: subject right now then you had Ben
Alexander here Who's a brilliant young man
[SPEAKER_01]: who is very intelligent in plant-derived
turps, so I'm not a scientist That's not
[SPEAKER_01]: my direction my direction primarily is an
assist people with genetic packaging
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning I put you into the right for riles
so that your farm your business succeeds
[SPEAKER_01]: My interpretation of the business is
what's accurate I have a tremendous number
[SPEAKER_01]: of people I deal with that are brilliant
scientists and brilliant people That's
[SPEAKER_01]: what they do so if you don't get confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to ask me about how to split the
atom That's not what I do I can tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: how to sell the atom I can tell you where
to find the atom and I can tell you how to
[SPEAKER_01]: use the app And so that's what this
conversation is going to be really about
[SPEAKER_01]: the second
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look at this because it's measured
off of marketability I measured off of
[SPEAKER_01]: your money It became a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not talking about in a friendly
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, who's got the turkey apart?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's is your cannabis selling and
people have this huge Misconception of how
[SPEAKER_01]: turpines interrelate with that fact and I
think that that had to be more important
[SPEAKER_01]: than how do we Read turkey pot because
you've got a lot to put existing you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you know when you have to breathe a damn
thing If you didn't want to there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: much genetic material available right now
And if you just went into it took a look
[SPEAKER_01]: you say hey I have enough to cover all my
markets now The question is how do we
[SPEAKER_01]: optimize it for what you do and so this
conversation is going to start with me
[SPEAKER_01]: being a kid Breaking up bales of
land-raised cannabis so when I was a kid
[SPEAKER_01]: on the East Coast I was involved in a
criminal family that was large this was
[SPEAKER_01]: organized chronic traffickers and As a
young guy I got to access all this bulk
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis coming in from the ships And what
it did was it allowed me to get I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: say a reference point of what cannabis was
from its original origin So it would come
[SPEAKER_01]: from these countries, and this was all
pretty documented meaning that was
[SPEAKER_01]: organized distribution organized delivery
And so throughout the course of the year
[SPEAKER_01]: the loans would come in and we would break
these up and then bail them and move them
[SPEAKER_01]: out And so he would start to know hey this
was Colombian and Panamanian And this was
[SPEAKER_01]: Thai and this was stuff from Afghan land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well we grew out some of those Afghani
seeds one year maybe 79 some of those are
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 because I caught a case in 83 at the
time so in 79 we grow those Afghani seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: in my grandmother's yard, and she had a
stunning organic garden and so we were
[SPEAKER_01]: able to put the seeds into this beautiful
fertile New England soil and We finished
[SPEAKER_01]: it out, and I remember smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember being so caught up with how
rich it was but how different it was
[SPEAKER_01]: because that was the first pot we grew
this is going back to you know the 70s and
[SPEAKER_01]: so I couldn't believe what those seeds had
translated into they had been they were
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely Afghani seeds because we took
them out of the flowers from the bagels,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we grew them in Rhode Island and all
of a sudden I'm smoking the progeny from
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds that we're dealing with and I know
it's the same thing and I can taste the
[SPEAKER_01]: similarities but there was something
missing and something added and So I just
[SPEAKER_01]: remembered this I have a good mind for
this this is just something that makes me
[SPEAKER_01]: strong in what I do I categorize stuff
mentally drives people nuts so I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: these things so I go forward and we're
bailing these for years and then I go into
[SPEAKER_01]: the military because I got in trouble and
got locked up and when I went into the
[SPEAKER_01]: military this was during the height of the
drug war I was a salvage diver and I used
[SPEAKER_01]: to get dropped out of helicopters onto
boats filled with billions of dollars of
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs in the Pacific and we'd dive on the
vessels and I started to be back on the
ships with all the land raised hot again
and I started to see and smell all this
[SPEAKER_01]: and I started to start to categorize and I
started to see the cannabis that was being
[SPEAKER_01]: produced in California this would have
been the mid-80s and I started to see
[SPEAKER_01]: California cannabis I started to see all
these profiles and clavichoid profiles and
[SPEAKER_01]: tastes and tones and at that time good
cannabis was good cannabis and it came in
[SPEAKER_01]: a billion arrays but it was all classified
basically as good, kind, dank,
[SPEAKER_01]: choice whatever it didn't make a
difference it was a good product was a
[SPEAKER_01]: good product and you started to see this
when I got into California up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: NorCal that would have been you know
mid-80s, later 80s I started to really see
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids come in I said why god
everything tastes the same it was because
[SPEAKER_01]: Baccarano was used and so we started to
see this all of a sudden Baccarano changed
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire tone of all California cannabis
all tasted like Baccarano so people
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that cannabis tastes like
Baccarano people believe that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: tastes like Afghanistan where I started to
see was the impact of the inputs on your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis itself so I started doing all
this consulting and hubble it was a legal
[SPEAKER_01]: consultant but it was the only way you can
see any quantity is to be able to really
[SPEAKER_01]: work with a lot of these massive
operations those massive operations let
[SPEAKER_01]: you run tremendous number of varieties of
strains within their operations and I
[SPEAKER_01]: would then be able to put any type of
variety I wanted in any one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: operations and by changing an input I
would change how we perceive that strain
[SPEAKER_01]: to be and so what we're getting down to is
that when you're talking about a profile
[SPEAKER_01]: of terpenes every input influences it so
when someone says to you I have a terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile I was asking well what not the
cannabis because the inputs you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: able to separate from and so it's such a
big deal that when I'm doing something
[SPEAKER_01]: like the emerald cup as a judge where I
judge the emerald cup I take a pen and I
[SPEAKER_01]: note things that taste exceptionally
similar and I keep track of those those
[SPEAKER_01]: samples and at the end of the cup I go
back and they usually from the same
[SPEAKER_01]: compost suppliers and so what we found was
the compost suppliers of Sonoma using the
[SPEAKER_01]: great waste had a much higher residual
sugar load which brought up which brought
[SPEAKER_01]: up the flavonoid profile of the cannabis
terpenes and things like this they drive
[SPEAKER_01]: these numbers up you get a higher overall
number does that necessarily mean it's
[SPEAKER_01]: better and when I'm better I had a
discussion in Hollywood like a month ago I
[SPEAKER_01]: brought up a piece of paper to show them
and it was a terp profile of a strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: banana cup that I have and it came out in
California seems like about five percent
[SPEAKER_01]: is tops Oregon goes up to 15 but we must
quantify it differently because Oregon's
[SPEAKER_01]: Protestant three times down in California
so we're going to use some California
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers because we use them at the lab so
five is considered a really hot strain
[SPEAKER_01]: terp delimit I got a 2.5 strawberry that's
half of this number that if you looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: terp profiles you would throw it away but
the problem is it sells to $4,000 a pound
[SPEAKER_01]: because it makes an exceptionally unique
concentrate so I showed it to Ben and Sam
[SPEAKER_01]: because we laugh because terp people say
that has no value but it's a four thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar pound as many pounds like to
produce so would you like that four
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand dollar pound?
[SPEAKER_01]: See that's so that's what the point is is
that the only years of me working with
[SPEAKER_01]: these jobs I got to work with so many
people I got to work with so many projects
[SPEAKER_01]: and I had so many illegal projects running
that I had to learn how to use a computer
[SPEAKER_01]: so I put on spreadsheets because I don't
have any way to track all this shit but
[SPEAKER_01]: what it did was it let me start to see
what was the impact of any flavor on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and what was the impact on the
environment then I started to take a look
[SPEAKER_01]: a little deeper and I started going you
know what this strain is killer but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: grown and produced and sifted sifted is
the key word under metal halide and this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular cutting was sifted under HPS
that means that the whoever grew it
[SPEAKER_01]: whoever found it they found something that
was developed in a specific environment on
[SPEAKER_01]: a specific nutrient in a specific
environmental situation and all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things contribute radically to how you
perceive terpies it has a huge impact to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point where it it's so big that I
don't think people even see it it's so big
[SPEAKER_01]: they just look at this is this and this is
my list and look at my numbers my numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: are big but the problem is you're looking
at terps and you're looking at 40 maybe I
[SPEAKER_01]: think there's like 240 in cannabis Ben has
a lab in Illinois from the Ben that came
[SPEAKER_01]: in he has a lab in Illinois that he can
access and we're going to start sending
[SPEAKER_01]: all these varieties to this lab because we
want to find out why do I have a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar cotton right now we only can see a
specific amount it's the missing pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: that matter so we can take a look a better
idea what is this in this situation
[SPEAKER_01]: produced here it has this particular value
can we produce it someplace else and
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer the value and see that's the part
that's tough for most people because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: producers you get things from people and
you say hey this was awesome for you but
[SPEAKER_01]: you take it into an environment and when
you put it into your environment you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: lead grow so you have exceptional lighting
except but cool and so you have an ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to do some different stuff but it changes
the plan on a chemical level and it
[SPEAKER_01]: reflects in its terpene growth we we
choose those plants and we put it into an
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS room and all of a sudden all the
monoturbs flare right off because it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't in a hot room when you chose it and
so the problem people have is it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: such an understanding of I'm just
producing pot because for most people
[SPEAKER_01]: they're really not dealers when people ask
me what I do a drug dealer who happens to
[SPEAKER_01]: love growing pot his whole life but I'm a
drug dealer who who happens to love
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics but I'm a drug dealer who loves
who owns dispensary but I'm a drug dealer
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm selling drugs otherwise I'm
not in business so we can call pot
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want you can call it tomatoes
but fundamentally to grow and that's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: experience that they want so you have to
take a look at your market we had this
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion some of the other day I said
listen you got to understand that if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: in a triple-a market which is visual it's
going to always be a mono-terpene market
[SPEAKER_01]: because people who buy visual pot don't
smoke it in consumptive forms it's little
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny pieces so they can put all the heat
on it in one time and get all the monos
[SPEAKER_01]: and sesquiterpenes and go is complete but
if that triple-a visual piece with that
[SPEAKER_01]: base goes into someone who spokes in joint
form by the second hit all the mono-terps
[SPEAKER_01]: have flared off because the heat that
moves through the joint so I started
[SPEAKER_01]: telling them like if you put into a
pre-roll market it's a sesquiterpene
[SPEAKER_01]: market and if you're going into into this
market it's a mono market you have to see
[SPEAKER_01]: it that way because they don't care about
the flavor as much as they care about the
[SPEAKER_01]: nose and the visual joint smokers wanted
in the mouth and you you have to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: look and say well then what lines work
with that and we take stuff like right now
[SPEAKER_01]: the best example I would think of is the
old burkle cutting because the old burkle
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting is really a descendant of the
brown river purple kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple kush to Mendo burkle whatever you
want to call it into every other modern
[SPEAKER_01]: hot strain right now where the Girl Scout
cookie the Aspas cherry pie all of that is
[SPEAKER_01]: through that burkle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those strains are primarily sold to
people who smoke them in form and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the way that that plant has an
ability to hold a sesquiterpene that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't burn off but releases this
pleasurable flavor in your mouth the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: time and so for people who are in the
pre-roll market you need to look into
[SPEAKER_01]: those directions and if you're not you
need to look in the other direction and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that most individuals really aren't
aware of their impact of what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing to their their line just like I use
the example of royal kush so I have a very
[SPEAKER_01]: specific royal kush line royal kush was a
line created in Humboldt by a man named
[SPEAKER_01]: Mandelbrot so Mandelbrot brilliant reader
he passed away about a year and a half two
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago from a sudden heart attack like
37 years old so Brot passes away but he
[SPEAKER_01]: does this reading project for royal kush
but he does the essay on 3,000 plants on
[SPEAKER_01]: the coast so his search was a 3,000
project he puts out 3,000 and he does them
[SPEAKER_01]: in Albion on the Mendo coast and he
selects this one incredible cutting so I
[SPEAKER_01]: hold this cutting he gives it to me I hold
it we use it to propagate we sell it as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting and it's the basis of every royal
kush plant now because Mandel got busted I
[SPEAKER_01]: kept that cut and hit it and when he came
back into the world I gave it back to him
[SPEAKER_01]: and the whole line continued it's a top
five in the EC where every time it's
[SPEAKER_01]: entered in the emirate column anything it
touches is a top five because it's got
[SPEAKER_01]: such a unique terpene signature so we go
god this is incredible and it's got such a
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance and it's got all these traits
that are phenomenal so we're just in love
[SPEAKER_01]: with this reading plant well indoor same
thing it's killing it well I'm transferred
[SPEAKER_01]: into Kettenpott a hotter drier environment
and lo and behold my stunning royal kush
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty good because it had been sifted
in an environment that was cool so you are
[SPEAKER_01]: sifting for where you're producing and so
for people that are producing in high
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain it's exceptionally windy those
type of situations you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: less production but those windier
varietals what you have happen is you
[SPEAKER_01]: almost have the limits the waxes in the
plant they literally encapsulate some of
[SPEAKER_01]: your monoturbs and so when you see this
high circulatory wind flow you see plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the city circumstances some of
those things allow you to have a radically
[SPEAKER_01]: different response to the Canada so I take
remember I own a nursery so what nurseries
[SPEAKER_01]: allow you to do is nurseries let me put
plants and thousand gardens across the
[SPEAKER_01]: state so I look at Canada's different than
most people because I look at it in 150 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 million dollars a year range of
production now I'm not making that money
[SPEAKER_01]: but I got my fingers on that production
number and so that lets me see what really
[SPEAKER_01]: happens and it lets me see the pulses of
these things and it's crucial because
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise how we're going to know and so
right now I've been really accurate with
[SPEAKER_01]: it but it's little things like the royal
kush in the wrong circumstance and so they
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to do well with it but not to
the degree they would have if we put it
[SPEAKER_01]: back in its cooler environment we would
have run it indoor we have to be careful
[SPEAKER_01]: with light depth strains what so when I
sift for light depth light depth is where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to go through an artificially
high temperature and humidity to where
[SPEAKER_01]: when you talk that shit it's spikes and
anybody that's got you know state of the
[SPEAKER_01]: art greenhouses you got half a million in
greenhouses this isn't for you but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not that guy you're going to have
spikes in humidity and temperature and you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to make sure the varieties that
you're using primarily for depth serve for
[SPEAKER_01]: your purposes so you gotta remember that
almost every variety that you mess around
[SPEAKER_01]: with sifted for indoor work so all the
seed lines I've worked with all under HPS
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's what I'm saying I know the
impact of what I did transfer that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: from HPS and the other other way I get a
radical different morphology the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: changes shape dramatically if I sift for
outdoor normally it precludes the indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: market every now and then strains with
touch that means that it works in both
[SPEAKER_01]: directions but sometimes it doesn't and
that's just the way it is and so for you
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're if you're a cannabis producer
you say listen you want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're sifting stock that works in your
specific circumstance using the foods that
you're using because that's your
production methodology it will influence
what you're choosing but you find what
works for you in that specific and if
you're not good at this part you don't get
people that run dispensaries successful
[SPEAKER_01]: ones and you ask them is this shit going
to sell?
[SPEAKER_01]: straight up is it going to sell?
[SPEAKER_01]: just give me it's quick no yeah I'm live
once but never again you need those
[SPEAKER_01]: answers and the next part of this is
really now that you understand so we clear
[SPEAKER_01]: on it the inputs that are coming into this
are so big that I don't think anybody has
[SPEAKER_01]: any idea really what turkey and profile
that plant has period you've grown that
[SPEAKER_01]: goddamn thing in space you might know well
you're not and all I see is these numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you know when Ethan brought that I
still have the orshonocene I still got the
[SPEAKER_01]: original paper but when that stuff popped
I went right over to the university and
[SPEAKER_01]: said hey I have a good relationship with
the University of California and I said
[SPEAKER_01]: hey send me over to your science
department I want to talk to your
[SPEAKER_01]: professors and I said can we map by
turkeys because I was going to try to find
a fingerprint so we can start figuring out
strings now we use fibers but I was trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to figure out a way to quantify what's
what and what's not what because when you
[SPEAKER_01]: do what I do and sit through so many
varieties you know they're all related you
[SPEAKER_01]: know they're touching but how?
[SPEAKER_01]: so you need tools to do this look and so
when I started to really take a look at
[SPEAKER_01]: turkeys in general is you have to take a
look and say okay do I want to become an
[SPEAKER_01]: encyclopedia of turkeys I think this
42,000 no I don't want to become an
[SPEAKER_01]: encyclopedia of canadins either you know
which ones I like the ones that get me
[SPEAKER_01]: high the other ones don't matter and we're
talking about the individual decision what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens is everybody's trying to become so
unbelievably intelligent that they forget
[SPEAKER_01]: that is not what the buyer wants they're
not looking for that information they want
[SPEAKER_01]: a product that simply works you sell it to
Americans for Christ sakes
[SPEAKER_01]: so what you want to do is just make it
simple for yourself and so what I did was
[SPEAKER_01]: I simplified these things but I try not to
dome them down my skill set is in what I
[SPEAKER_01]: do I don't have to be a molecular
biologist I just have to know one I have
[SPEAKER_01]: to ask them explain to me the fundamentals
so that I don't make mistakes at that
[SPEAKER_01]: level so I did as I said let's take a look
at cannabis and simplify it so I broke it
[SPEAKER_01]: up into four basic categories I broke it
up into Fools and Earths and Fruits and
[SPEAKER_01]: Florals because to me as a distributor
someone who's been pushing weed for years
[SPEAKER_01]: that basically covers the spectrum the way
labs kind of break it up is basically like
[SPEAKER_01]: myrcine, garofalene, limonene,
pionene and what's the other one that goes
[SPEAKER_01]: along with garofalene?
[SPEAKER_01]: little oomph that gives us a fire right
but the problem is that's based off of
[SPEAKER_01]: perfume and essential oil tech so burn
that shit and show me one essay that says
[SPEAKER_01]: what happened when you burned it I don't
think there is any so therefore you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using data that isn't accurate and you're
pretending like it is and you're running
[SPEAKER_01]: wild like you're a friggin turkey genius
and I'm like look it's tiny and dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: but not in your perception which means
there must be a precursor term somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: that's affecting it something's either
increasing or decreasing this thing we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not seeing any of this crap so I broke it
up into four divisions to make it easy for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself lo and behold I created competition
and used those four divisions the next
[SPEAKER_01]: thing I know I've got a guy named John
Abrams who's a UCLA brilliant professor
[SPEAKER_01]: but he challenges my assertion he goes
what made you do that I said it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense to me because I'm a distributor it's
easy and he goes you're not right and I
[SPEAKER_01]: said well then disprove it because I don't
have to prove it I'm right here I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: telling you straight up it breaks up into
four categories so he goes back to UCLA
[SPEAKER_01]: where the fire is asked to go prove me
wrong but what happened was I was right
[SPEAKER_01]: and notice this little paper you can dig
all this up so if you went out with a guy
[SPEAKER_01]: in GA you could pull all this paper so
it's like a 30 or 40 page piece he did on
[SPEAKER_01]: it he did a six-hour medical conference in
Vegas on this topic because it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time they had enough samples put
together that let them look at turpentine
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles and using graphing technology was
pretty neat I got to see really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: graphing technology that let them see
visual pictures to see relationships and
[SPEAKER_01]: how they connect and so he showed me this
incredible into relationship he said
[SPEAKER_01]: basically Kevin's pionene and limonene
which is fuels earth subset through floral
[SPEAKER_01]: subset and so he goes you were completely
right in your simplified breakdown and so
[SPEAKER_01]: the point of it isn't to say that I'm so
damn smart is that if I could simplify
[SPEAKER_01]: 42,000 into four then maybe you can too
and it makes it kind of easy because we
[SPEAKER_01]: can take a look at those markets now and
say fuel market, fruit market,
[SPEAKER_01]: floral market, earth market where do those
markets exist and where is my distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: within those markets and so I know that if
I'm in certain situations I know that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have to be in like a floral which
is blue dream in this area and someone
[SPEAKER_01]: says blue dream is a fruit which one which
blue dream there's like nine or ten
[SPEAKER_01]: different ones I have two of them one of
them would quantify under a fruit flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: and one would go under a floral because it
goes more under the haze so which one you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be almost individual because we
can't go by a line and even if you went
[SPEAKER_01]: from a specific cutting you're going to
get a base where water is moving and this
stuff is so crucial because what it does
it allows you to pick things for your farm
[SPEAKER_01]: and make money so when I produce BHO it
sells 120 bucks a gram because that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing and that's important and
that's because that's how you hunt it
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll like holy shit because otherwise
we're going to get wiped out so I look for
[SPEAKER_01]: specific things and we do tests and we
find out that's the one that people like
[SPEAKER_01]: then I can do anything I want any test I
want on it because it's not going to give
[SPEAKER_01]: me the goddamn picture it's going to give
me a snapshot through a keyhole I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to say wow he owes two people and he's got
a fish shirt on it no it's a roof of
[SPEAKER_01]: people so my perception is so accurate
that it completely negates my choices
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm not making choices I'm just
doing something that doesn't make any
[SPEAKER_01]: sense and for me it's crucial that you go
about this you have to pick the right
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties for the application for your
purposes and so I know what I do for my
[SPEAKER_01]: own situation where I I break up those
four categories and I take a look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: subsets and I say hey how much of a
distribution does my farm have to have in
[SPEAKER_01]: these respective areas where do people
like earths that's ascendant and where are
[SPEAKER_01]: you seeing where are you seeing fruits
happy uplifted people that's typically
[SPEAKER_01]: going into cartridges now because it's
going into women older people changing
[SPEAKER_01]: where's the gas anybody that has opiate
pain because opiate addiction in America
[SPEAKER_01]: is out of control and for all the years
that I've been running businesses I've
[SPEAKER_01]: asked I don't know 5,000 people why do you
buy a problem why do you buy a cushion I
[SPEAKER_01]: got an opiate problem and I said oh Christ
everybody's got an opiate problem and so
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever happens with opiates because I
don't do anythings whatever happens with
[SPEAKER_01]: opiates certain cannabis varietals allow
to really be exceptionally effective and
[SPEAKER_01]: under replace it and so if you're in
California everybody's drugged out of
[SPEAKER_01]: their mind you better sell fuel because no
one is going to get any effect on a fruit
but how do you use the fruit to drive a
sale because what's the most indicative
[SPEAKER_01]: terms citrus terms and so what and then
this is just straight up tobacco go you
[SPEAKER_01]: did this one before but what's the point
of that I want I don't want to date you
[SPEAKER_01]: but I want you to friggin want to buy
twice right so just call it what it is I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to buy once I don't want to buy
twice I want you to buy till it's gone I
[SPEAKER_01]: want you to chase the state of California
to buy all of that extra I want the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: state to be up because people call it holy
Christ and all in a way that's not a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: thing so how do we do that look for these
things that work for us and we start to be
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligent about what is it where is it
so if you're going to go into the pen
[SPEAKER_01]: market then those are those bright
turbines those things go that direction
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you're going to go into pre-rolls
then it has to be early and gas is
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily because those things are going
to hold the flavor through the end of it
[SPEAKER_01]: if we want to throw a fruit onto a gas we
have to bring it in and then we can
[SPEAKER_01]: combine and start to have it in varieties
you can actually mix cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_01]: container and put it in the joint and no
one would ever know the difference because
[SPEAKER_01]: I do with concentrates all the time where
I blend concentrates and give it to you
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a better product because I said
listen I'm going to give you the delivery
[SPEAKER_01]: the citrus but I'm going to lay this one
in here let me figure out the ratios and I
[SPEAKER_01]: just weigh it out so I can kind of
recreate it again and I just make the shit
[SPEAKER_01]: because what people do with the wine if it
will end a wine with that thousand years
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's no difference it's combining it
so that you can figure out okay I got you
[SPEAKER_01]: people love the citrus but they burn out
quickly because they don't get high long
[SPEAKER_01]: enough so what am I going to do I can give
them some gas with it so I give them some
[SPEAKER_01]: gas with some citrus and now they're sad
and that's something you need to be aware
[SPEAKER_01]: of but it's really only going to move
within these four lines and so you going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have billions subsets with each one so
earth and every little thing below earth
[SPEAKER_01]: but basically you're going to go curfew
and a single word you can describe I'm in
[SPEAKER_01]: the water I'm wet I don't need to talk to
anyone else I don't care if I'm in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Aegean Sea or the South China Sea so I'm
in the water and so it makes it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: easy in that form and that's important for
you because I think as the cultivators
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody I talk to they're so confused as
to really what it is that they're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm like wait a second what you have
to do is identify your production capacity
[SPEAKER_01]: and identify where you're at and start to
find the rivals that work for you using
[SPEAKER_01]: your production methodology and a lot of
that is getting a lot of clones from a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people and running all of them and you
just run all of them so I might run 50,
[SPEAKER_01]: 60, 60 different strains every year like a
clock from time minimum yeah I mean I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: running them all year round but outdoor
I'm putting them outside too so I can see
[SPEAKER_01]: them in form and say oh wow I didn't
expect you to be so good outside we had no
[SPEAKER_01]: idea then we take the plant and put it
inside and we go holy Christ you're
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible wow and it was just like what I
used to do with indoor I used to sift for
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor so heavy and when I started
transferring it outside I made this
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible mistake because I was on a 12-12
trigger and so I'm pushing my plants
[SPEAKER_01]: artificially late because I don't have a
14-5 switch I have a 12 switch and it
[SPEAKER_01]: screws you same thing it also has
characteristics that work for that indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS you know at that time it was all
hydroponics once we shifted into organic
[SPEAKER_01]: you know growing systems a couple of
actually decades ago but when we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to organic systems it was starting to try
to understand what is the input on the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic components to your candidates and
to me guano was something that was
[SPEAKER_01]: supernatural I don't think anything ever
tasted as good as guano but it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: environmentally destructive to mine it
that I don't use it I just try to stay
[SPEAKER_01]: away from the shit I realize that I was
doing more damage growing pot I mean we're
[SPEAKER_01]: environmentally concerned with the crust
of mine and the earth dry behind us and so
[SPEAKER_01]: guano doesn't work so what do we work with
we work with some of the fish products
[SPEAKER_01]: because they bring up they bring some of
those flavors in I noticed that when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: in Hawaii canvas that was grown with pig
shit I thought it was the soil because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: in Hawaii I'm growing up smoking I'm going
okay okay this is this is Molokai this is
[SPEAKER_01]: Molokai weed and I went back to Humboldt
County and my friend had a pig farm and he
[SPEAKER_01]: had grown using that material up in the
hills and it was the same profile and I
[SPEAKER_01]: said boom it wasn't the Molokai soil it
was the pig shit they masked it so like I
[SPEAKER_01]: said I keep track all these crap because
I'm trying to understand what am I really
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at and what do I do and that's why
when you take a look at a lot of salt
[SPEAKER_01]: based seeds they all distinctly put a
flavor on it so cutting edge puts a flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: on it, fast nutrients puts a flavor on it,
GH puts a flavor on it and it if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing with those methodologies and you
have somebody who's actually active with
[SPEAKER_01]: this shit they can puff it and they can
start to tell you which one you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: because they all have a little bit
different bite and why is that because the
[SPEAKER_01]: delates are different and the mineral
mining sources are different so those
[SPEAKER_01]: little tiny subtleties change the canvas
profile there too and so this is huge
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're talking about getting
somebody an experience they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: want to buy twice and we buy stuff and we
go hey let's go use all this shit let's go
[SPEAKER_01]: make more make more and the reality of it
is if you wanted the nastiest turf profile
[SPEAKER_01]: it was really the most genuine you didn't
know be the opposite because the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: using turps is a bioprotective so if I
want to experience the full range of what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm supposed to experience I would have
the plant at its worst condition period
[SPEAKER_01]: and ideally I would even try to mine the
biology from the where came from so I just
[SPEAKER_01]: like your stomach biology you have your
the stuff in your gut affects how you
[SPEAKER_01]: function the stuff in the soil changes
pickups so I ask specific motorized I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: drive silicon uptakes well that changes
the quality of the plant but I'm sure it
[SPEAKER_01]: has a self like it's change in tone so
your microorganisms affect this also and
[SPEAKER_01]: so every single input has this incredible
impact on what you're doing with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that at one time you know I
used to see people not grow homogenous pot
[SPEAKER_01]: so I see a lot of homogenous pot now and
I'm not trying to knock turpentina but
[SPEAKER_01]: so all I get is I get a fat number on a
chart right tell me what strain you grew
[SPEAKER_01]: after you grew better you can't tell
there's no there's no separation and if
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a problem determining what I'm
doing tell me that's not going to affect
[SPEAKER_01]: the effect too I have to be nullifying all
these subtle effects and so you remember
[SPEAKER_01]: the campus that we're messing with is not
land rates even a land race stuff that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was getting isn't really land race it's
coming from land race areas but if a human
[SPEAKER_01]: being put his hand on it that should help
me to write so it's not land race it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just that it's from land race pockets so
it lets us kind of know hey this is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: real in its genome form but other than
that we don't have any idea what these
[SPEAKER_01]: things are like and people who did a good
job or people who said hey listen I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to start to work with what I have
here and so for me I spoke to a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that's done with ferments that's
phenomenal because it's really unique and
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what they're fermenting and
what they're driving it through you start
[SPEAKER_01]: to get these these flammable profiles that
are just really really bright and
[SPEAKER_01]: beautifully long lasting in the mouth
itself and that's what one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences you can't get around it
believes a flavor that's why the skittle
[SPEAKER_01]: is so unbelievable the skittle is really a
weak inbred knock off of the shirt
[SPEAKER_01]: genetically it is but it has the single
most unique flavor you've experienced in
[SPEAKER_01]: your life it's like you stuck your finger
right in that thing of tag when I was a
[SPEAKER_01]: kid I was a kid and so we had tag you know
and so you stick your fingers you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be an astronaut too now when I put
it in my mouth when I mess with the
[SPEAKER_01]: skittle it's the exact same experience and
the skittle right now probably goes to
[SPEAKER_01]: like 32 33 on the market as a human so
right now in California thousand bucks is
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can sell it for a thousand you'd be
jumping up and down tell me you sold it
[SPEAKER_01]: but skittle it three times that's starving
banana at four that you wouldn't know by
[SPEAKER_01]: the turf test you wouldn't know by the
polls you know the numbers on the star
[SPEAKER_01]: banana are good but same thing people
always come to me with the sheets look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the sheet look at the sheet I'm just like
Christ who's the lab operator oh somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: I know my bunny's machine so none of this
is even
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I know that I'm not qualified
either my mom's a brilliant scientist
[SPEAKER_01]: right when I have a question about who I'm
not I ask her that's not my forte but my
[SPEAKER_01]: forte is an interpretation and it's
understanding I take this information and
[SPEAKER_01]: I apply it that's what I realized because
anybody I talked to I'm like you wear that
[SPEAKER_01]: the cup you're running was sifted for an
indoor hydro into HPS and put in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse they're like I don't know you
mean
[SPEAKER_01]: so my job is to stay mentally active and
to make sure I stay on point and I try to
[SPEAKER_01]: give this information to people I'm around
because I present them with genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: packages of hey these things are good in
these circumstances and here I can give
[SPEAKER_01]: you a sample of it you produced it using
this methodology so I can I can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: give you the list of the inputs I use and
what we did and where we did it to get
[SPEAKER_01]: this and then I know where you are so to
me because of all the years of criminality
[SPEAKER_01]: it allowed me to have a different type of
relationship with most of the guys I deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with because they apparently trust me
because they know I'm probably dirty than
[SPEAKER_01]: you were so there's no way I'm gonna match
out and that's the truth and what it did
[SPEAKER_01]: was it allowed me really to have an honest
conversation because nobody's talking
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody and it's trying to figure out how
we get function primarily as a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery producer I don't suppose I do not
really a month sold out most of the time
[SPEAKER_01]: not to regular people commercial
individuals that are producing millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars each minimum it's a very specific
market I've developed a lot of do and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: because it makes it very simple for me to
do it I can have this conversation and it
[SPEAKER_01]: lets us both work and then they can give
me feedback on how it works for them
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately we can find out hey what do we
know about this this cutting so that
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty soon we know in the aqua greenhouse
that and what lighting system and what
[SPEAKER_01]: feed range and how you can put yourself in
situations where you have a market where
[SPEAKER_01]: you want a market that has a few citrus
and they tell you this but you can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: it to come out you define when it does and
and find someone who's created that
[SPEAKER_01]: situation and say hey how can I replicate
it the bottom line is for all us crap
[SPEAKER_01]: people to work together share this shit
with so done but it doesn't say this a
[SPEAKER_01]: decade you better get the boat together
you're gonna drown and and getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: boat together means you work together on
these sifting projects it's very hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: do a population sit by yourself and most
people really aren't qualified to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: decision what's your qualification how
many people have died in the morning none
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're not the right guy so let's
find the right guy you you're the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: ascertains quality of canvas flowers let's
get you in here to make this decision and
[SPEAKER_01]: help us out are we going the right route
do you like the profile do the feed work
[SPEAKER_01]: how does how to work out would you buy it
twice and you're going to get this info
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so important one thing else is the
data back of am I go in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: direction with what I'm doing because I
see most cultivators just straight running
[SPEAKER_01]: on the god damn road into poverty because
they're not talking and they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing any information because we come
from such a private culture I mean Christ
[SPEAKER_01]: I have rocking on closet freaked me out
but I didn't have any other option because
[SPEAKER_01]: I had such a clear vision one day of today
I knew that I had to come out of where I
[SPEAKER_01]: was at and enter the normal canvas and I
made that entrance and now I'm not shit my
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderland nursery is named after my
lawyers can't figure out I wonder how you
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't land in federal prison
[SPEAKER_01]: but my concerns are in the neighborhood
with you I help out all my partners people
[SPEAKER_01]: check out because I service
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to kind of see that shit it's it's
real and some of this stuff is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: require multiple farms to kind of work
together and say hey I didn't say I you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I do it I do it multiple people in
multiple states so I need four people I
[SPEAKER_01]: work with the four of us on and I got one
new fact
[SPEAKER_01]: so he may not speak too much so it allows
me to say hey this makes sense yes and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I know because sometimes even I need
a confirmation on it because I'm like hey
[SPEAKER_01]: is this going to satisfy the market
because what's gonna happen is emotionally
[SPEAKER_01]: and businesses and emotions and so I
ripped that shit out all the time it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: it clear is it or is it not so you get
together with the groups and you start to
[SPEAKER_01]: work and so every year I might get one
killer cultivar icon but I got three
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies hunting too so every year I'm gonna
get four new cultivars that are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: pop up it lets me stay calm constantly and
then I take these things that are red hot
[SPEAKER_01]: and I share them with people who could use
a goddamn help and I don't want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: lost and I just say look this cuffs gonna
make a difference to you because it's good
[SPEAKER_01]: sorted for your application just trust me
and then all of a sudden you got somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: else who survived you're going to need
them you have no idea who's going to give
[SPEAKER_01]: you a life graph I'm telling you it's a
freak show and you all know it and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get worse and this is how you
really function is marketability you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to carve out a niche you need commercial
cannabis to come because without it you
[SPEAKER_01]: have no separation commercial schwag
farmers go big on let salt farm down boys
[SPEAKER_01]: go big there has to be a place the crap it
has to be it's just that how will you get
[SPEAKER_01]: people to want to buy it and it's not
going to be it's an exorbitant price
[SPEAKER_01]: either that's going to be exceptionally
marketed that's a whole nother skill set
[SPEAKER_01]: this one is how do I get a fair price to
cannabis that produces that method and the
[SPEAKER_01]: only way we're going to be able to do this
is to get into varietals that have high
[SPEAKER_01]: high velocity and you start to work those
along those those varietals and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: goes in cycles I know that with OG it goes
on multi-editor it goes on a multi-editor
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle and so OG I hold OG I hold OGs that
are earthy I hold OGs that are fueling I
[SPEAKER_01]: hold OGs that are citrus because it
changes everything in the air they want
[SPEAKER_01]: citrus this year they want a gas next year
they want an earth next year what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: examples of those ghost SFV and like the
bloodbath in the hells angel right so it
[SPEAKER_01]: lets me use some very specific cuttings
that people interpret as gassy citrusy or
[SPEAKER_01]: earthy but all within the OG realm I make
sure I hold them and then I just know that
[SPEAKER_01]: this market is not a fad I love 20 year
fads I'm sure every fad is going to be and
[SPEAKER_01]: you just let that stuff run because you're
not going to have the population will
[SPEAKER_01]: shift within them so it makes it kind of
easy once you start to build up your
[SPEAKER_01]: libraries once you start to get your turf
divisions broken down once you start to
[SPEAKER_01]: really see what works for you on your farm
and is exceptional you work with it and
[SPEAKER_01]: get it out into the public but you're just
going to get yourself some honest feedback
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think most people really I had a
the wine in California we used to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: wine guys come in so the wine guys always
come in and want to tell you that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: stupid and they straight up and they're
basically telling you you're under
[SPEAKER_01]: educated so I spent the day with this guy
most of the day I heard I was under
[SPEAKER_01]: educated but at the end of the day he was
like wow we're not going to qualify to
[SPEAKER_01]: judge pot I said exactly because cannabis
is complex it's not got a lot of alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: and turps there's a lot of other shit
going on and so because of that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to handle the effect and so if
you can't we're going to tell people how
[SPEAKER_01]: much I smoke and how much I can smoke in a
row and I tell people when I judge a
[SPEAKER_01]: competition how much I'm blowing through
it a single sitting there in horror and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like I'll do it again I'll pick
the same one out for every single fad one
[SPEAKER_01]: because bottom line is you can tell
quality is quality I'm not trying to make
[SPEAKER_01]: something become something I'm allowing it
to be what it is I don't add to it I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: adding my own flavor to the damn thing can
you taste my favorite one is can you taste
[SPEAKER_01]: the very in it no but if I hope a little
bit more I might and so that's that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about reading terms and I
started realizing with all the scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that's coming with marker assisted
that our reading programs are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: change dramatically over time but
primarily when you're working with with
[SPEAKER_01]: with reading terpene profiles it's
obviously complimentary complimentary
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles people start putting too much
crap together and it all jams up and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like wait a second I want
dissimilar stuff to come together to form
[SPEAKER_01]: a union I don't want just a bunch of shit
dumped in a basket that's that's not that
[SPEAKER_01]: attractive in any form and what are we
trying to put together and the problem
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to find is that it's never
going to be the sexy male that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do this because I always use me as the
example my sons are into international
[SPEAKER_01]: athlete and my daughter is going to be 6-2
and I'm like I'm a genetic runt so what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened I'm a perfect breeder male I
don't really pass a lot of trades on
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's what you want to see is the
male stamp those trades and what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have to do is you're going to
have to do the same thing because people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't understand it's typically not as
simple you can always go through a
[SPEAKER_01]: population and find outliers but we're
trying to put it together so there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: greater population so that I don't just
find the only one that fit the bill but I
[SPEAKER_01]: had 40 that fit the goddamn bill and out
of the 40 I got the one that could handle
[SPEAKER_01]: morphologically the loading of the wind
and I got the one that had to trigger so
[SPEAKER_01]: it finished by the first and it gets
enough wax to keep the monos and it's got
[SPEAKER_01]: enough secondary bonds to hold in the
thing but that's a good one but I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: go through a big population to do this and
so in your breathing processes that's how
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to look at it scientific stuff is
going to help us tremendously phylos is a
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful tool because it lets us take a
look that's why I love phylos so much I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: in love with the technology because it
cuts all the bullshit stories are out of
[SPEAKER_01]: room I've read this no you didn't stole
from him I'm sure you're out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just people are quiet all of a sudden
there's nobody on the internet anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: rapping about how much crap they created
because I'm out here because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: screwing people over like these guys this
is a good example right here that's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: example so HBK this kid did awesome
reading so he reads this strain and he
[SPEAKER_01]: sells it to dispensary in Sacramento gives
him some stuff they rename it and it
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes green ribbon and green ribbon
becomes this unbelievable strain they want
[SPEAKER_01]: a turk festival thing so I hold this I'm
the one that holds the cutting of it so I
[SPEAKER_01]: hold this cup and so I'm talking Eric
seven years later I mean but in the
[SPEAKER_01]: meantime for seven years I hold this cut
it's been credited to a dispensary in
[SPEAKER_01]: Sacramento as the creators they bred it
they did it they were the only people that
[SPEAKER_01]: had it so I have this it's in all these
different breeding projects it's all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the place I need everything and we're
friends and one day he says hey I phylosed
[SPEAKER_01]: my cut that I have with this strain and
it's the same as yours and I said oh it's
[SPEAKER_01]: easy you got robbed because I know where I
got it from and I know you're the green
[SPEAKER_01]: you must be the green or the red and so he
got screwed by the dispensary and so we
[SPEAKER_01]: just renamed green ribbon where we call it
green ribbon it's really like green candy
[SPEAKER_01]: green cracker jack but since it's been
called green ribbon so long it's just that
[SPEAKER_01]: I made sure his name got attached to it we
put it out like that because the problem
[SPEAKER_01]: with this shit is that how is anybody
going to work with you if you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: steal their shit how is anybody going to
trust you if you're going to jack them for
[SPEAKER_01]: all their crap and the problem is that's
all we got is trust because that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: the dope game is really about faith and
trust and and so that's why I'm having
[SPEAKER_01]: such a miserable time right now with the
new industry because nobody has any faith
[SPEAKER_01]: and trust and it has to happen so you guys
like Eric create this incredible strain 52
[SPEAKER_01]: days indoor 26% on the THD you've got four
sons and on the turf it hits every number
[SPEAKER_01]: you want which means it absolutely moves
through dispensary markets legal markets
[SPEAKER_01]: absorb that shit complex nasty little
beast so you come back and get it again
[SPEAKER_01]: but lo and behold he gets ripped and so
that's the whole thing is you know you you
[SPEAKER_01]: it's what you use it and so Filos is good
because it allows you to take a look to
[SPEAKER_01]: see what you use and find out what's
inside this what's the outliers we found
[SPEAKER_01]: some weird stuff where we noticed that all
the OGs that have super numbers have like
[SPEAKER_01]: a skunk progenitor so I know that all my
OGs that have way higher numbers than
[SPEAKER_01]: normal there's a skunk in those so
somewhere back in the day someone came in
[SPEAKER_01]: and let this happen but you want to see
all this to know because that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: where the tone is coming from that's why
this one doesn't have it's because it's in
[SPEAKER_01]: that piece if we had known through Filos
what we made things up we were made so I
[SPEAKER_01]: hunted all the CBDs down initially and we
chased all the CBDs shit nine years ago I
[SPEAKER_01]: was on a CBD hunt for a while because it
was what was needed but it's Filos would
[SPEAKER_01]: have made it so much easier because it
would have let me understand better what I
[SPEAKER_01]: was looking at and I would have been able
to see better hey the Pakistani genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: lines is where all the CBDs live and so
when I started getting when I started
[SPEAKER_01]: getting material from Pakistan and started
letting me see this and it started let me
[SPEAKER_01]: see what was coming from Pakistan directly
and it started go whoa that's where all
[SPEAKER_01]: these numbers and ratios are coming from
we're not looking at the right population
[SPEAKER_01]: we say it doesn't exist it exists fine
right here same with your terms and same
[SPEAKER_01]: with all your stuff you just got to go
into the work but what most people are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing is lazy work there's not great
populations sis hey I put ten seeds out
[SPEAKER_01]: and you should take those ten seeds and
you should cross the damn things and get a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand seeds out of that and go through
that population then you find an outlier
[SPEAKER_01]: that works for you and people go but
that's a lot of work and I said well
[SPEAKER_01]: unemployment lies a lot of work too
understand what's going to have to happen
if you're going to have to put a level of
work into getting your genetic package
[SPEAKER_01]: together because ultimately what is the
person interfacing with you it's that
[SPEAKER_01]: product that's all they know is that they
don't give a shit about anything else and
[SPEAKER_01]: so if you're watching Spencer's with their
numbers only like I got a five-star
[SPEAKER_01]: service in the Bay Area that I use to work
with their friends of mine constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know what five-star line should
look like and so he just comes up and he
[SPEAKER_01]: lets me feed him non-stop with every
single new thing I'm playing with after I
[SPEAKER_01]: run it I go nasty five-star and so we run
it through him so it just lets us see what
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks like because he pretty produces
everything indoor organically and I'm an
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor guy so his work lets me see my
beautiful cuttings in a different format
[SPEAKER_01]: and sometimes there is awesome and
sometimes they're better they go damn that
[SPEAKER_01]: was really for an indoor set and so you
have to be able to get you some partners
[SPEAKER_01]: get you some people some different markets
take a look and see what's really moving
[SPEAKER_01]: you got dispensary people I walk into
dispensary he's got 400 selections I go a
[SPEAKER_01]: few million something tasty boom and I go
and they go oh these are the ones that are
[SPEAKER_01]: flying out the door and they go I'm not
asking for it I'm a turpelene I want a
[SPEAKER_01]: semianite who's asking for that crap I
want a bananee they use words and so you
[SPEAKER_01]: start to change it I can hear it on the
turp chart this one says it but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: taste like a damn banana but if you feel
good it's there but this one seems to have
[SPEAKER_01]: much less almost none but the banana
flames don't believe me strong so you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to have the ability to have that
conversation so that the seller of the pot
[SPEAKER_01]: can say I want something bananee they
don't look at the chart they go hey this
[SPEAKER_01]: one's really pretty bananee don't worry
about it and that's really how the buying
[SPEAKER_01]: goes down you're people know I'm like oh
there's such a disconnect on how sales are
[SPEAKER_01]: made and I was like wait a second you can
sell the product and get the people to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand and you present them in these
arrays and you do your work and that
[SPEAKER_01]: really puts you in a much better position
is what lets me much more I'm the only guy
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it doesn't have an investor and
it's because we're working non-stop it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like this little game right here where I
think I'm better than you with this and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about what's quality what's the basis
of a good experience in these different
[SPEAKER_01]: directions so this way people can
experience what you want to give them and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're able to really get the money back
and that's where our pieces are I think
[SPEAKER_01]: we're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time for some questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's put some questions out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got time for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, earths are always low but
they're a specific group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Florals fluctuate depending on what
regions are in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fruits are pretty strong because of the
extract market and if you're in Cali,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuels can't run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I was in Seattle I'd go and take a
look and say, what have you buying?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's everybody smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would ask you, what y'all smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I start to take a look and say,
well I think Blue Dream is killing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys feel like ethereal kind of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like a little more awkwardly lifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like more introspective which would be
more of those florals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would start to go into those.
But in California, holy shit, it's so
homely based.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you people don't ever,
like we got a drug problem in our country.
It's supernatural.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of people in California that
have some homely based kind of thing going
[SPEAKER_01]: on is so huge that I don't think gas will
ever go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a thousand people being asked over
at Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we have radical changes too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have radical changes too because you
gotta remember the last couple years in
[SPEAKER_01]: Cali, Cali's on about a 26 year cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every 26 years you see this fourth
cycle kind of roll through, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last 10 years we've been on this
incredibly excessively hot, dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we're back up to 120 inches of
rain now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're going back into the wet
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing, the cannabis varieties that
we've chosen for those situations,
[SPEAKER_01]: when the temperature changes or it gets
conversely moister, change in tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where indoor is that strong
because they can keep the damn thing the
[SPEAKER_01]: same all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't ever, ever get the waxes
high enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you get is you'll never get a
sesquiterpene bud out of an indoor that
[SPEAKER_01]: touches an outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Botanoterpene, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can protect that, and I can get
a higher percentage of cannabinoids in a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific indoor because I can control the
environment so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get my humidity in the eye,
I can control the room I play in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can get it down to like 14%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a cedar resin ball to play in
there.
But that's a very specific situation where
you know what?
It doesn't produce the waxes, the hole,
and the sesquiterpene length at the end
isn't the same.
How about the market though?
Does the market shift with the seasons?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what, they'll want to smoke in summer
versus what they want to smoke in fall?
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean typically mutes, I would say not
the average smoker, but if you were at a
[SPEAKER_01]: store and it was in the summer from June
to September, you'd see 90 days of tourist
[SPEAKER_01]: sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as soon as September 1 hits,
tell me everybody's coming to tourism
[SPEAKER_01]: after work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all back to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's Seattle smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Humboldt, we're going to experience
this in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a matter of fact, what I did is I
just created an entire bed lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew out an entire bed of low-potency
varietals that's about 10 and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's unbelievably rich in the mouth
and full body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, hey listen, with all the
tourist market that's coming in,
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff that I'm smoking is crippling
people and they're going to make me sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, well for me that's
normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to really understand what
are these markets that are going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: in in these windows and who are these
people going to be and what would they
[SPEAKER_01]: like to experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think so much of it is this
beautiful expressive in the mouth,
[SPEAKER_01]: full but not devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's devastating for someone like me,
one at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_05]: You talked about guano being a major
impact on the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that talking about guano being
phosphorus dominant back guano?
And what other kind of phosphorus dominant
things could affect the flavoring at the
late stages?
There's nothing you use that doesn't have
an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really about trying to back what
people are working on these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it plant obesity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people try to, because of the,
and this is all from our black market
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to get the most out of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the problem is you're loading this
plant up and you're pushing it to a level
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can't because we can keep adding
more bacteria and we can keep adding more
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi and we can push this thing in these
irradiated pots and we can create the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plant is so loaded up that really
it's unhealthy and that's where so many
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogenic problems come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I backed off my food load,
my moral problems went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it disappeared dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I have to do is increase my scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, open up the scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're talking about getting
food into cannabis in terms of phos,
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as I have an adequate amount of
bacteria going, I'm going to have uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: on that phos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the hardest one to uptake,
but I'm going to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to drive it too heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go with too much colloidal clay,
it's kind of sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go with too much of a fish direction,
it leaves a fish tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go with too much kelp, I'm in the
kelp world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of it is just really which
variety of cannabis that you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: works well with the mix you're using.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the culture of bacteria that you're
using has a dominant effect on the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just with the compost teas,
depending on what compost tea I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I use a synergy tea, which is an
excellent tea, I use that as a vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: tea because I got it as a 50 fungal,
50 bacteria, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get a good, even mix and it drives
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when I switch in a flour and tea
from Green Bicycles, that one has more of
[SPEAKER_01]: like a limestone flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It adds a tone to the cannabis that's
sharp.
And I dig it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use that product because it adds such a
beautiful, it just activates it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it leaves this really nice,
clean, clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pulled the top 10 off the emerald last
year off the LUs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of about 1,100.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use EC a lot because it's just a big
competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I own a competition too, and I get a
couple hundred samples that come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: EC gets 1,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it lets you see a big population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important to say, listen,
out of 1,000, this one clearly stood out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that methodology did it, where back up
on the inputs and rely on the genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my whole thing with Guano is I still
didn't wish I had a bag of it because it
[SPEAKER_01]: used to look like graphite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be, it was different,
it was fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh, it made pot so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like the most wonderful thing
ever to come to California and experience
[SPEAKER_01]: Guano dopenomo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those errors are done, and I just
really don't want to, I get back to my
[SPEAKER_01]: yard, and I look at it and I laugh and
say, you're right, I'm not feeling like
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stealing your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to look at it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main point is, if your market
loves the flavor of your cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're selling to a store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that are in that store love
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you, don't break what's not
broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just you don't know yet, but you lay
out your base mix, lay this stuff out,
[SPEAKER_01]: and let the acetation begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can't detect it until it's
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it starts to let you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: A quick question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see the future of cannabis culture
areas like viticulture?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we talk about market demand on
regional boundaries like state or areas,
[SPEAKER_04]: but eventually we're going to be able to
transport this across the world.
If we can survive till then, we'll be
alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's time to survive till then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's not separated by region,
won't that bring a lot more of us to this
[SPEAKER_00]: more larger competition?
[SPEAKER_00]: More everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it allows you to have historical
production zones, and you can build a
[SPEAKER_01]: brand from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole point of champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Champagne is four grapes, common
production methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same methodology, but four grape
choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this way they can share anybody's wine
with anybody else, because it's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: grape that makes champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the secondary process that defines
the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike burgundy, which is the appellation
that defines the burgundy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the champagne is one group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burgundy is one group, but each little
appellation is what determines what they
[SPEAKER_01]: work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, common grouping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can set it up to where some
of these production zones in these areas
[SPEAKER_01]: had small craft components, but I don't
know where the economics are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, because right now the indoor
push is so big, I just talked to a guy
[SPEAKER_01]: that had a million square foot.
I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw pictures of it.
I was like, holy shit.
I mean, a million square foot on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a multi-stakeholder.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't little.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they flew in to talk to me about a
project in a hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were rapping, and he started
showing me, he goes, we're a million
[SPEAKER_01]: square foot in a hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to not believe the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's building, I'm building, I'm building,
I'm building.
It's crazy.
But the point of it is, is that all that
occurs, there's going to be some natural,
there's going to be a thing of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't meant to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't, we were in drug culture,
illegal criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were in business with cannabis,
you were going to be criminal,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the cops came over your house,
they said, okay, handcuffs on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're locked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we never had any prescribed future.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was, this was roll the dice the whole
damn time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of us that were ballsy and
rolled the dice, well, we've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: re-roll them one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one is, can you clearly separate
yourself and cannabis from the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: entity?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you define yourself and how do you
get to a larger school level that lets you
[SPEAKER_01]: exist?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many people have to merge up to do
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for me, like my farm, I dropped my
farm to 10,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had an ability to be a lot larger
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made my farm 10,000 square feet because
it puts me in craft and I know that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: move all those 10,000 directly to my
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why do I want to stress on the farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I recommend to people is diversify
what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you've got to have some more skill
sets in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I, when I go to do what I do,
I look at it from a bunch of perspectives
[SPEAKER_01]: at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I realized a long time ago,
I couldn't be a farmer only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I knew that I sat there and I
said, okay, I'm gonna be a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, oh no, they're gonna fuck me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be a nursery guy, they're gonna fuck
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I eat at the stores and distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I was done, I had a frigging
list up, I got a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that if I didn't have the
tree, I was gonna die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every single branch was dependent
on the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't have a hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, oh Christ, so this has been
this relentless pursuit of how to
[SPEAKER_01]: diversify into so many separate
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then no matter what takes place,
I'm alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I tell people is spread
yourself out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy, you got a tree coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, now, is how did you
develop, I'm like you, I grew up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 50s as a trafficker, early 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my question, I'm a newbie,
I guess I call myself a newbie now.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you develop the trust when you're
talking about getting with other growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm in 500 acres, 200 here,
Carolina, and in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do you develop, get rid of that
fear?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that fear, that snitch,
because you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you good at judging people in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's, I'm a good man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, I'm a kind hearted person.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I tell you, trust yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel comfortable with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do trust yourself, and I'm a kind
hearted, but when sometimes when the vans
[SPEAKER_00]: come and knock on their door, some
people's door and say I won't give you 40
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surprised how my so-called brothers,
all of a sudden, that shouldn't surprise
[SPEAKER_01]: you though, because someone puts a gun to
someone's head and says, snitch,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like, well that ain't death.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know, but what you gotta realize
though, is that you're not in that time
[SPEAKER_01]: period though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in another time period.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get yourself out of that time
period?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mentally, I knew I had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take me a long time to change
my mind, where I go, why don't you move my
[SPEAKER_01]: feet, they don't light me on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, we're walking right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm throwing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have no time to burn alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I know is that I trust myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody that's looking to do quick
shit, short term shit, shady shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: over profitable shit, you're shitey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't, I'm from a criminal world.
[SPEAKER_01]: A real criminal world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you help when I speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that wants to do something shady,
has to get you to agree to get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody honest has ever gotten fucked by a
shady person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds too good to be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good at participating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
