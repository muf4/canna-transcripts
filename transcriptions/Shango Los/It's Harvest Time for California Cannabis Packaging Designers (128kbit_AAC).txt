[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at the Washington Coast this weekend
sampling five different outdoor growers
[SPEAKER_00]: that I picked up at Emerald Cup from the
Emerald Triangle area from this past
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed something that four of the
five companies were selling their stuff in
[SPEAKER_00]: mason jars, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, you know, for example, this flower
from Scarlet Fire is fabulous,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in a mason jar, which has been
totally perfectly appropriate for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: up till now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're great for someone else's
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the new, you know, regulated
market, that's not gonna be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody's gonna have to be
getting packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crazy thing is, is four of the
five of the farms that I'm sampling this
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend all need packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that there is a hell of a lot
of work that is coming up for designers in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's who I'm thinking about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my gosh, all the graphic
designers, all the package designers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all like the naming designers,
brand strategists, all have got so much
[SPEAKER_00]: kick ass work coming up for them in the
near future, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're already in with cannabis
companies and like you're down with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and you're an edgy designer,
oh my gosh, you've got a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: really good work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know what it's like to be working
with a client that I especially am into
[SPEAKER_00]: their product, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I'm into it, like when I write
commercials for living soil companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, people who are like,
you know, probiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm writing their commercials for
the podcast, I'm like into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so same thing I would think for
designers who are about to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy all of these, you know, designing
the package for the product and then also
[SPEAKER_00]: designing the package that holds the
product at retail, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus all the billboards and new magazine
ads and Super Bowl commercials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, this is a good time to be a
designer in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking about you folk today and I
hope you really enjoy it and appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: this because this is a time and a place in
California for designers and I hope you
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy it.
Thank you.
