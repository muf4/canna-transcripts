[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this week is Dr. Robert Faust
who is the president of BioEgg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Faust attended the University of
Delaware College of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: His major was entomology and applied
ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later he received a bachelor of science
degree from the University of the State of
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, an accredited university in
Albany.
[SPEAKER_00]: His master's of science is in agronomy
where his thesis was field research on the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of ecological and organic methods for
crop production and the use of humates and
[SPEAKER_00]: bio-based fertilizer in large-scale
production in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_00]: He received his PhD from Columbia Pacific
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Faust lived in California for many
years where he was a licensed pest control
[SPEAKER_00]: advisor and IPM specialist who advised
organic farmers on soil and pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management, conducted contract
biopesticide research, and was a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial sales manager for Safer
Incorporated, a company that produced and
[SPEAKER_00]: sold alternative pest management products.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also conducted organic certification
inspection and consulting with the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Faust is a leading expert in
agroecology, providing integrated services
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the world including the United
States, Egypt, Belize, Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mexico to assist in reducing
dependency on chemical fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides using new biotechnology and
foliar fertilizers to increase crop yields
[SPEAKER_00]: and create sustainable systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to welcome to the show,
thanks Dr. Faust for taking the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: chat with me today and I'd love to dive
right in with a little bit of your
[SPEAKER_00]: personal history in terms of how you came
to work with humic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I come from southeast Pennsylvania
and my family had a farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the farm on the weekends,
my grandfather's farm, so I was highly
[SPEAKER_02]: influenced by being around it,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got on the organic movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of the first people involved in
biodynamics and organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was back in the 60s, but I went to the
University of Delaware and studied
[SPEAKER_02]: entomology and applied ecology and just
about every other science they offered.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was back in Vietnam days,
so we wanted to stay in as long as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in Wilmington, Delaware,
which is the chemical capital of the
[SPEAKER_02]: world, and I didn't want to go that
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to be the alternative to toxic
technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started farming while I was still
finishing college, running our family farm
[SPEAKER_02]: and started being an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a member of the biodynamic
association, trying to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: biodynamic farming, which of course relies
on humus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So through the years, my whole goal was to
provide alternatives to toxic technology,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I saw what damage could be done by
synthetic pesticides and herbicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Relying on that technology, which is
unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point, I decided to move west.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was in the early 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a small piece of land in Montana,
Flathead Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to improve the soil because it
was overgrazed, it was hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to raise purebred sheep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was looking for a way of improving
that soil, and I noticed a little ad in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Montana Farmer Stockman magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had an advertisement for Clod Buster,
soil softener supreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a humus product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I called him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is before the internet, so you had to
call people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was magazine type articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I was a scriber to organic farm
and garden magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That influenced me a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I talked to the supplier of this
so-called Clod Buster Humate, and I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: never heard the term humate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew what humus was, but I didn't know
what humate was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they sent me a small sample,
maybe a couple ounces, and I set up,
[SPEAKER_02]: took some of my soil, put it in pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a little greenhouse that I'd built.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I set up test plots with sweet corn,
with and without, putting a pinch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we didn't even know how much to
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think putting a good pinch on a
four-inch pot, and then planting corn,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then having a control, untreated
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the results were dramatic within two
or three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Germination was quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shoot, the plant itself, the corn was
bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was outgrowing the control.
[SPEAKER_02]: The root system, when you wash the soil
off, was extensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, this stuff does something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's where it all started.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little sample of raw humate from New
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started out with essentially learning
about humates from trying out this
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did that research take you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Had you already done your doctorate at
that point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a long time after.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't until 1986.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was like my first experience with
humates was in like 73, 74.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, it got me into the next
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: A master's in agronomy, and then a PhD in
biotechnology and agroecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sort of fed my scientific curiosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: This product, which the university system,
says nothing about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you did mention it to an academic,
he said, oh wow, that can't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not putting on enough per acre that
it could do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's snake oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I knew different, because I used the
scientific method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's doing something, so don't tell me it
isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: My eyeballs tell me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that the negativity
surrounding humus or humic substances in
[SPEAKER_02]: American academia just stimulated me more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I knew what it was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that they were suppressing
that information, or actually negative,
[SPEAKER_02]: going negative on it, made me even more
interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to the next level, because I was
working with farmers in the seed potato
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was involved in the seed industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed potatoes, seed beans, as an
agronomist, as an advisor, pest control
[SPEAKER_02]: advisor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a client who grew seed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are very sensitive to
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be disease-free and certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we bought a truckload, 20 tons,
24 tons of this humate material from New
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did test plots, 20-acre test plots,
20 acres with, 20 acres without,
[SPEAKER_02]: on potatoes, seed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what I saw right to the row,
and I still have the pictures of this,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I'm going to present at a conference
this fall, American Society of Agronomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happened there was we had a lot
of leaf damage, leaf feeding activity on
[SPEAKER_02]: the untreated potato plot, 20 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then right to the row, I mean,
where we applied the humic acid,
[SPEAKER_02]: humate product, there was little,
if any, insect damage at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, plants right next to each other,
one row over, no insect damage,
[SPEAKER_02]: back over to the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lepidopterous defoliators, I mean,
holes like Swiss cheese in these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, the plants were more
vigorous on the treated side and they
[SPEAKER_02]: yield higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that obviously got me interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as an idealistic young guy who
wanted to provide alternatives to toxic
[SPEAKER_02]: technology, I saw something there that was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put this stuff on, I don't know what it
is, and somehow the insects it provided a
[SPEAKER_02]: level of resistance to potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this could be an incredibly
important thing for the organic industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a pest control advisor's
dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put this stuff on the ground,
get better growth, resist insects,
[SPEAKER_02]: and get higher yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nevertheless, the folks at Montana
State University, who I knew they just
[SPEAKER_02]: discounted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much are you using per acre?
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, in those days, we were
using a raw humate product, unprocessed,
[SPEAKER_02]: dusty, kind of messy, and we're using 200
pounds or more per acre, up to 400 pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're saying, wow, there's not
enough humus or organic matter in that to
[SPEAKER_02]: do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on their limited knowledge,
really, since they couldn't really wrap
[SPEAKER_02]: their minds around how it was working,
they just denied it, that it could do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, well, there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the result.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but it can't work because it just,
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bottom line is I knew it did,
and things just progressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're involved in many other crops,
a lot of potato crops, a lot of bean seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was growing giant squash in Montana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd bring the county extension agent over
to look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd just stand there with his mouth
open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, well, you're growing stuff that
really you shouldn't be able to grow here
[SPEAKER_02]: in Montana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just got more and more involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I moved to a larger agricultural
area, a major agriculture area,
[SPEAKER_02]: where I set up a farm services consulting
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing, organic certification,
and formulation of products and
[SPEAKER_02]: application of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we started using humates in
combination on a lot of crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything from sugar beets to barley to
potatoes, dry beans, corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a full range of crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's that time I started doing more
formal research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my research was in what are the
limiting factors?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the limiting factors that hold
back the yield of crops?
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, most of these crops have a
genetic potential for an excess of what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're actually seeing done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's holding them back?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my research over the years has been
crop limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was part of my master's thesis in
agronomy and on beans, potatoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: barley, things like that, common crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what's holding back the yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get up to yields like 237 bushels an
acre on corn, which was really big time in
[SPEAKER_02]: those days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over 120, 160 bushels barley, on and on
and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked to older farmers that farmed
there and Twin Falls, Idaho, when it first
[SPEAKER_02]: opened up, it's irrigated, flood irrigated
farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farming for irrigated farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they talked about 45 sack beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the problem was the bean yields
have dropped to 15 sacks, 10 sacks from 45
[SPEAKER_02]: sacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a good yield was 25, 24,
25.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what happened to the 45 sacks that
the original farmers in that area had?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there must be a limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so over the years, we found out by
leaf analysis, soil analysis, and trial
[SPEAKER_02]: and error that the limiting factors were,
well, not only trace elements,
[SPEAKER_02]: but root growth itself, a lack of root
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of it was the use of the herbicides
they were using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other parts was this is a desert soil and
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farming oxidizes the organic matter and
the organic matter gets down to below 2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the experiments that we did,
we found that humic substances apparently
[SPEAKER_02]: are the limiting factor, a major limiting
factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, since then, there's been a
lot, that's 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since then, working with other scientists
from around the world and doing pretty big
[SPEAKER_02]: formal trials and tests, we found that the
main limiting factor on any given soil is
[SPEAKER_02]: activated humic substances or humic
compounds and monosilicic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when those substances are depleted and
organic matter, of course, is unstable,
[SPEAKER_02]: it oxidizes, it leaches, it blows away,
the yields come down because it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: like when people migrated to the West,
they'd move into the Midwest, Ohio,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say Indiana, clear the forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was hardwood like oak and birch and
various hardwood species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would clear that and then they'd
plant and they'd get high yields for a few
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the yields would be reduced and
then they'd move West.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a constant moving West,
soil mining and Westward movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my whole concept is we either
figure this thing out or agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just relying on chemical inputs
and more and more disease issues and
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance issues, problems with
production, new spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my background, as a farmer,
my family had been farming in Pennsylvania
[SPEAKER_02]: since 1733.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had basic grasp of organic
methods going way back, using compost,
[SPEAKER_02]: having livestock systems where you compost
manure and put it back on crops so you
[SPEAKER_02]: could grow corn to feed your livestock,
that kind of mixed farming scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we knew the value of humic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humus and compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the biodynamic people tried to
put some science to that, like Pfeiffer,
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Pfeiffer and Steiner and people like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It influenced me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we knew, you know, I was already kind
of sold on the idea of organics because I
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of grew up with the Amish and
Mennonites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the results were obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matter of fact, the first time I used
MaxiCrop kelp, on corn was on suggestion
[SPEAKER_02]: of an Amish neighbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just couldn't deny them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so over the years, you know,
the humate thing, I got more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: deeper into it, including many,
many trials in greenhouses and in field
[SPEAKER_02]: crops, row crops, specialty crops,
and tried different deposits from around
[SPEAKER_02]: the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so we found out that some of those
deposits don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you'd be disappointed,
but you didn't know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how come this one doesn't work?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the same humic acid content as
this one, let's say from New Mexico versus
[SPEAKER_02]: Wyoming, let's say, or another location
within New Mexico or Utah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as we knew, based on the only
testing available was just for humic acid,
[SPEAKER_02]: which isn't really even a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was radical differences,
either sometimes no results, sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: negative results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at why?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the difference here?
[SPEAKER_02]: They all analyze this humic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are higher in humic acid,
like 80 percent or so, but didn't provide
[SPEAKER_02]: the results on actual plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where there are some of the products that
were as low as 25 percent humic acid had
[SPEAKER_02]: spectacular results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of mysteries involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that at that point, Dr. Foss,
can I pause you for a second for our
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you give a quick definition of the
differences between humus, humates,
[SPEAKER_00]: humic and fulvic acids so that people have
an idea of what those differences are?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, humus is what's going to form under,
let's say, an undisturbed forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's under the duff layer, which is sort
of the leaves and the bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a decomposition of organic
matter, specifically leaves, bark,
[SPEAKER_02]: twigs, the stuff that falls from the
forest and is decomposed by fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and it's the same as what would happen
in a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a range of microorganisms
really dominated by fungal organisms that
[SPEAKER_02]: can take apart cellulose and produce and
phenol and lignin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lignin is a big factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lignin is in bark, twigs, leaves like oak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oak has a high level of tannin,
lignin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some of the best soils were
developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we see here in the
Willamette Valley, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so you have microorganisms breaking it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the definition of humus is the raw,
undecomposed organic matter that you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: find next to the soil in the upper
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the definition I've heard for humus is
that it's the decomposition of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter to the point where under a
microscope, you can't tell the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: if that was originally a peat leaf or a
dead animal or some other remains and that
[SPEAKER_00]: humus takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not something we're going to get
in a compost pile in a period of a few
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree with any of those
statements?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have different levels of humic
acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, and then that's where these different
definitions are like fulvic acid,
[SPEAKER_02]: humic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Human, H-U-M-I-N, that's like insoluble
fraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's one of the only substances or
chemicals defined as a fraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So humic acid is not a substance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a chemical that you can analyze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is humic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humic acid is defined as the alkaline
soluble fraction of organic matter or
[SPEAKER_02]: humus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fulvic acid is defined as the acid
soluble fraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so these can be separated by alkaline
extraction and acidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have the humic is black and
gradates into different shades of brown
[SPEAKER_02]: and then fulvic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you still there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you broke up for a second there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said the humic acid is black.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's black or brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can gradate from brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fulvic acid is gold or yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a story on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Low molecular weight is the yellow stuff,
the gold, fulvic, so-called fulvic acid,
[SPEAKER_02]: acid soluble.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has got a low molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so that can be absorbed by plant
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be absorbed by cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be absorbed on a foliar
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: The black stuff can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a high molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so plants can't directly utilize that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, it's got a colloidal
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you put it on too heavy,
it tends to plug the roots up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It globs onto the root system and kind of
plugs it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get negative effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So only the gold fulvic fraction is
actually going to be absorbed by a cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really is a cellular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the black stuff can be utilized by soil
microorganisms and fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does have an effect on matter of
fact, the last paper I published,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was last year in Japan at the Humic
Substance Society, was the effect of these
[SPEAKER_02]: products on soil structure and bacterial
versus fungal dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can take a burned out soil like we
have here in the Willamette Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been over farmed, hardest cement or
turns into muck clay when it's wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my experiments applying humic and
fulvic acid to the soil in pots in a
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse, incubating it for different
periods of time, and then looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: sending it to local labs here that do soil
food web analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we found in there is that the
controls were totally bacterial dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hard, pretty much unproductive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we use treatment, so the humic
substances, and then in 60 days,
[SPEAKER_02]: different intervals testing, you see that
it reversed everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the soil went from bacterial dominant
to more fungal dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that because of the additional
carbon and the chelates that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting with the humic acid molecules?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually way more complex than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certain amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, another thing that we've
noticed is that, and farmers would report
[SPEAKER_02]: this over and over and over, is once we
use the humic acid products on the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: they start to see earthworm activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hadn't seen in years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd see castings on the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd see earthworms when they plowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that impressed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is it that's causing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a small amount of humic substances per
acre, it's almost nothing, 200 or 300
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds an acre, with our newest products,
of course, are activated, concentrated,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're effective at 30 pounds an
acre, even 10 pounds an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has substances like certain amino
acids, like thiocene, which are a
[SPEAKER_02]: requirement for earthworms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got a fairly amount of complex
biochemistry that isn't totally defined.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are requirements for fungal
propagation and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, humic acids are even
effective in increasing mushroom growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: mushroom media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure we're really there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, why that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a hidden hunger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like we didn't know what
caused scurvy either, but they found out
[SPEAKER_02]: that lemon juice or lime juice would
prevent it, but we didn't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: vitamin C was at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see these humic substances as the
vitamin C scenario of modern times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a requirement to prevent
diseases and provide optimum growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know it works, just like they knew
that if you ate limes, you wouldn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: scurvy, but they didn't know about vitamin
C.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are components in there that we
just have not, we're not there yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the specific components are that do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a cellular thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's essential for cellular life.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that on a broader scale,
humic substances are protein acceptors and
[SPEAKER_02]: protein donors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, in a higher level of
cellular biology, they have the ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase acceptance of electrons and
protons.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been published research pretty
recent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has a very basic effect on some very
basic properties and nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to say it's because of
chelation or this or that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much more complex than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with molecular genetics,
as it turns out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm jumping ahead 40 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's let's talk a little bit about
that chelation benefit, just because that
[SPEAKER_00]: is something that is most widely known
about humic substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you that may not be
familiar with the term chelation,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really just a fancy word for bonds
with essentially the minerals in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and helps you can expand on this helps
make them more plant available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it has a buffering effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so if you make a nutrient solution and
you try to make a concentrated nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: solution, you know, you're going to have
bonding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have like phosphate tying
up with calcium or iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have nutrient interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to keep that those elements as
individual elements in solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to they're going to react.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to combine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, into an insoluble precipitate.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, the humic substances prevent that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, that's sort of the
chelation effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, so you take zinc,
the zinc by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you add to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, it's crucial zinc.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can tie up with calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can tie up with iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tie up with manganese you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, excess phosphate can tie up
zinc.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the root system and you get all those
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's that's that's part of the
reason the agricultural decline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it lacks buffering substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what humic substances do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you take zinc like zinc sulfate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you combine that with the humic
substance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have something called zinc fulvo
humate.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, so you've created you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've put the zinc in an organic form.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, slash chelation chelated form.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, it's it's part of an
organic complex, and now it's not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: combine with something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would allow you to use lower
concentrations of zinc sulfate than,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise you have to use a huge
amount because it ties up so fast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and so these elements are mostly in
the soil anyway, but they're already in
[SPEAKER_02]: soluble precipitate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: So use of humic substances on a natural
soil tends to reverse that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for instance, humic substances,
fulvic acid, are really big time
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible for phosphate availability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the soil and as the organic matters
depleted, the humic acids completed,
[SPEAKER_02]: depleted, phosphate availability is
reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so farmers respond by huge amounts of
phosphate because it's going to get tied
[SPEAKER_02]: up almost literally within days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, they're using high doses
every year and you can't tell them
[SPEAKER_02]: otherwise.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: But and this is a big part of my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Idaho and in other places, I'm telling
the farmers, no, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's test the total phosphate levels
in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this use of excess phosphate is
tying up zinc, and now you're having like
[SPEAKER_02]: reduced maturity, reduced growth because
you're causing a tie up of zinc because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the excess phosphate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you flood irrigate, you're
forming phosphite, which is toxic,
[SPEAKER_02]: is causing problems with the root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so we'd actually test the soil for
total phosphates and it'd be as high as
[SPEAKER_02]: 10,000 pounds an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they've been putting it on for so
long, you know, but the soil organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter depleted to less than two percent,
so they weren't getting availability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we would put humic acids
on and do leaf analysis and you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matter of fact, in decades of me doing
this kind of work, I've never seen a case
[SPEAKER_02]: yet where the phosphate didn't come up to
optimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Level without adding any additional
phosphate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a matter of humic substances
maintaining availability.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is particularly a phosphate,
but also trace elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, biological activity, good diversity
and bioactivity help as well in dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with with remediation in situations like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because, you know, biological
activity is what's producing natural humic
[SPEAKER_02]: substances in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: To begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you use a human product,
it's like priming the pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, we'd put it on in the
spring and the organic matter is two
[SPEAKER_02]: percent or less, like one point five
percent phosphate levels by the
[SPEAKER_02]: availability scale would be five or six
ppm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by fall, after a human
application, the organic matter
[SPEAKER_02]: inexplicably could come up two percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so four percent, you know,
three and a half percent and the phosphate
[SPEAKER_02]: availability would be good the entire
growing season based on leaf analysis,
[SPEAKER_02]: petiole analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a very rapid effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why?
[SPEAKER_02]: How could it possibly increase the organic
matter that much?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about thousands of pounds
per acre of organic matter, and you've
[SPEAKER_02]: only used it the most, let's say,
when we use the raw stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 pounds an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, but what's going on there is you're
stimulating root growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're stimulating fungal biomass big
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you have a mycelial mass form in
the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and then that becomes organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so that'll test as organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, you stimulated a lot of
activity and the fungi can break down raw
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter like straw roots,
dead root systems, you know, plant
[SPEAKER_02]: residues and and then the soil test will
show an increase in soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it took that priming the pump with the
humic substances to kick off, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, I'd also advise them on
different tillage methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're not going to plow deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to plow the good organic
matter deep in the cold soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, organic matter humus forms on
the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where a fence post rots right on
the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the activity is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to change tillage methods
tilling on the surface, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping the organic matter, what we call
managing to decay systems so that we do
[SPEAKER_02]: get humic substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty much what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're stimulating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we didn't have a soil food
web analysis then like we do now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we can look at these things and see
what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fungal biomass increases and just
forms a mycelial mat, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: within the whole soil and forms crumb
structure because, you know, it tends to
[SPEAKER_02]: form a stable crumb structure because of
the mycelial activity and sort of forms in
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go from a slimy soil that sticks
together to one that it has a crumb
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of that is the colloidal effect
of the humic acid, which tends to coat a
[SPEAKER_02]: soil particle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a living layer between the dead
mineral of the soil and the living plant
[SPEAKER_02]: root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also causes a formation of crumb
structure in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is really crucial stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the humic acids or humus in the
soil is, you know, the only difference
[SPEAKER_02]: between the earth and the moon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I studied soil formation when I lived
in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matter of fact, I developed all these
products that I sell now in Hawaii when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was working with a range of industries in
Hawaii because my specialty was decline at
[SPEAKER_02]: that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my life, you know, I'd worked as a
researcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, why do we have macadamia decline?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we have avocado decline?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening to the trees?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on with citrus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's decline systems all about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do the orchards go the other way?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked at soil formation in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see everything from fresh lava
that's 2000 degrees to 150 foot tall
[SPEAKER_02]: rainforest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on the age of the lava flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can you get six feet of soil of
what they call histisols or organic soils
[SPEAKER_02]: form over sterile lava rock?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of important information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it all starts with with with a
sterile rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty highly mineralized,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have you begin with lichens
that start to grow on that rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get higher plants like
grasses, lichens break down and humus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's all about humic substance or
humic acid formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gradual process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as as as succession progresses,
you know, from lichens to grasses to
[SPEAKER_02]: brush, you know, the soil layer gets
deeper and thicker and then trees start to
[SPEAKER_02]: appear and then they start dropping leaves
and bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, then the soil gets
deeper and deeper, you know, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: people come in, cut down the rainforest,
plant coffee or whatever macadamia or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is, pineapple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over the years, the soil just
goes away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just oxidizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're right down on lava again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the Hawaiian native Hawaiians
before Europeans knew how to handle this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew how to be sustainable on that in
those conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just soil miners that came in and
wrecked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bottom line is nature can make,
you know, deep, very rich, very balanced
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, starting with sterile lava.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so what we're doing is we're
just speeding that process up by taking
[SPEAKER_02]: mined mined materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings up a couple of questions
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We because humus is caused by the
composting process or the breakdown of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had a compost pile and I think every
every gardener should and I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase that decomposition rate in terms
of in terms of making my own humus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that will have that humic acid
and fulvic acid fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I be applying any of the humates to
my compost pile?
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, I assume things like aerated
compost teas could also help in increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: that biological activity and helping speed
up decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like I should use a lot of
things that are high in lignin,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, you talked about,
because that'll break down into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That humic acid fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what do you recommend in terms of
optimal composting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've done a lot of different
composting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of ways of achieving
that, because we can go right back to
[SPEAKER_02]: biodynamic compost preparations,
which influenced me back in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know what they were,
but it was this black powder, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you added that to your your raw
materials and composting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's called the biodynamic preparations.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I have now are products like fulhumic
and all that basically are modern
[SPEAKER_02]: biodynamic preparations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you see, if you compost with deficient
organic matter, in other words,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're taking organic matter, whatever it
may be, straw or whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: off of deficient soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're going to have deficient
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you can't make a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what my grandfather used to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty hard to find like virgin
materials to compost that would have the
[SPEAKER_02]: right balance of trace elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always a problem there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done a lot of trials with TM7.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, in compost tea,
we've done all kinds of analysis by
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the increase in fungal biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what are the best things for
compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it's kind of interesting
what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Municipal waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, right here in Oregon and
in Washington, you know, they're taking
[SPEAKER_02]: like leaf, all the stuff they rake up in
the city, you know, the leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: the fallen leaves, all the wood waste and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then composting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's got lignans, tannins,
you know, it's oak leaves, it's hardwood,
[SPEAKER_02]: broadleaf leaves and bark and twigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your best stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I do agree with you that leaf mold
compost is some of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love collecting leaves and also,
you know, alder, softwood and a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of softwood and hardwood wood
chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our municipal compost up here in
Washington, I found is really not all that
[SPEAKER_00]: good because it's one processed very,
very quickly in just a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a lot of time not even
finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bacteria is highly dominant and still
creating a lot of thermal energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if my neighbor or someone
down the road used, you know, high levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of herbicides or pesticides on that leaf
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may end up in my compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: The compost they sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's we have a couple of sources
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you if you go back to
biodynamic theory, you don't want to use a
[SPEAKER_02]: compost until it's well rotted.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the term they use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well rotted.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it also you don't want to use a
compost until it's got critters in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, earthworms,
insects, little things crawling around.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, so it has to be, you know,
go through its cycle, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the heat and all that, the actinomycetes
and all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes into a fungal stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, I actually grew up around
the mushroom industry in Pennsylvania,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've been a mushroom grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these folks know more about compost
than anybody, you know, because you have
[SPEAKER_02]: to push this compost through all these
stages to where it's a media for fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that requires it's a lot more
elaborate than your municipal compost,
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, on the conventional or
let's say classic biodynamics,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might the composting process might
last two or more years before the compost
[SPEAKER_02]: is cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is contains, you know,
little critters running around inside of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really important point
that you bring up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Static composting or giving the compost
time to really break down is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really lacking in, I'd say,
90 percent of commercial composts that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to make your own,
you really have to dedicate time to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you would a fine wine or a
whiskey or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to keep aerating it
because if you let it go anaerobic,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's toxins there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots will touch that and stop
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's any clumps of anaerobic,
stinky stuff, I call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the compost should have that
good, rich smell, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a rotten smell, not a sour,
not a septic, but a rich humus,
[SPEAKER_02]: which any good Pennsylvania Dutch farmer
knows what I mean.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or any good farmer, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these municipal compost products,
they're just the beginning stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bring that stuff in here, a truckload.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I recompost it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I reformulate it, pile it, aerate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we sit out here for a year or two
before I'm going to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I add other stuff to it,
like calcium sources to balance the pH,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in other words, for the get the
right fungal activity, you got to have
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have the pH reasonable,
the high level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like in mushroom composting,
you add a lot of gypsum, lime,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say, and other substances to it,
because we're really trying to grow fungi
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are negative, like,
for instance, a lot of compost and potting
[SPEAKER_02]: soils, they use bark, fir bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, this is a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you use more than 10 percent fir
bark in something, there are negative
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, this is because of the breakdown of
that bark dust and it forms phenolic
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds and other substances that are
negative to growth and microbial.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, it's sort of like
disinfectant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's all kinds of breakdown
products that are negative to root growth
[SPEAKER_02]: and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, bark, I'm talking about
soft, you know, pine, fir and all that is
[SPEAKER_02]: negative, more negative than, let's say,
oak.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bottom line is it needs to be all
broken down and cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll start to see fungal activity in
the compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you'll you'll notice fungal
activity, especially under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have a stable compost and the
ammonia levels are gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've they've they've the microbial
activity that has converted the ammonia to
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial protein and then the fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's a pretty complex thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Composting, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can cause yourself a lot of
problems using what they call compost,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is really, really kind of isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we talked about it on another
episode that I did, the idea that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these potting soils have fir bark,
but it's also known as forest humus or it
[SPEAKER_00]: has it has a bunch of names that make it
sound like it's a beneficial ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you already discussed some of the
detrimental effects and potential it can
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they use they use bark because
they have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but it and they use a lot more than 10
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that more than 10 percent is a
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's there's people out here
using, you know, 40, 50 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never use a bark fir bark in any
of my pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make my own potting mix, you know,
and it's pretty much I'm going to start
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it commercially.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be sort of a real premier
brand, you know, that's just going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: sold locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's quite sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been doing a lot of testing here
with it, and it's basically recomposted
[SPEAKER_02]: municipal compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: We either get from McMinnville or south of
here by Corvallis where they have some big
[SPEAKER_02]: composting operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we recompost it and we and we we amend
it and then we combine like humic
[SPEAKER_02]: substances in a pretty high level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then actually we use steel
slag, which is a high source of calcium
[SPEAKER_02]: and salicylic acid and trace elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also super cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're talking about, you know,
people are spending too much for some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these potting mixes and they're really
inferior.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've done a lot of tests,
growth tests comparing my simple you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: mix, it's all local stuff versus some
expensive potting mixes, which I won't
[SPEAKER_02]: mention the brand names.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I can get about double the
growth out of out of my mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, there's a lot of people wasting
a lot of money on some of these potting
[SPEAKER_02]: mixes big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, if you take a look at what
we're doing here, you'd be a believer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it just goes back to real simple
biodynamic concepts and good old organic
[SPEAKER_02]: farming and gardening magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just good basic stuff that,
you know, that farmers have been doing for
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of years, probably thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, so it's not like we don't have a,
you know, a model, you know, that we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know what's sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've studied sustainable and
that's part of my Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: thesis, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is studying sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, which cultures were
sustainable in terms of agriculture and
[SPEAKER_02]: how did they do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always thought people would be
really interested in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've given papers on the subject,
like one of them was called ancient
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawaiian agriculture as a model for
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some real meat in that,
but very few people were interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: that because it seems like ancient
history, like no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's old hat, you know,
we're up to date, we're modern,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're scientific, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you start talking about
ancient agriculture as a model for
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainability, you get a lot of,
well, there's just not a lot of interest
[SPEAKER_02]: in that concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the bottom line on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: These folks were farming for thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been farming for maybe, well,
here in Oregon, 150.
[SPEAKER_02]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 200, 250, let's say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Native Americans that were here
before us, including here in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Willamette Valley, were farming for
thousands of years sustainably,
[SPEAKER_02]: not necessarily farming either.
[SPEAKER_02]: They managed an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, the Indians here or the
Native Americans here in the Willamette
[SPEAKER_02]: Valley, they were managing an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't actually farm, but they were
very effective in what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the Hawaiians actually farmed and so
did the Mayans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been in Belize, I've studied,
I've been with the Mayan Indians.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in Egypt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in all over the place studying,
you know, ancient agricultural techniques
[SPEAKER_02]: because they did it without chemical
inputs and they did it for long periods of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk about sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's the goal, sustainability,
sustainable agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many years does it have to be
sustainable to be sustainable?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how many years are we talking
about to qualify for sustainable?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because we happen to know that
there were cultures that farmed
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainably for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were only, you know, we were only
here maybe at the most 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we are seeing this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a big movement now around
Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one-star revolution by Fukuoka has
become really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him in Santa Cruz in a conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was highly influenced by him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I set up raised beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried all his techniques, mixing seed,
pelleting seed, scattering it all
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one of my examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my studies was what he was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did manage to meet him at a
sustainable ag at Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: One year in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was quite a breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, he was, you know, people were
skeptical of him, you know, the
[SPEAKER_02]: establishment in Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet he proved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so that's what we need to be looking
at, you know, like real examples of
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainability, not just like what we
think based on the conditioning from the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the agrochemical industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they were saying, oh, you don't
need compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just use chemical fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow one crop after another.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, except soil turns to cement.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's totally not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I live around, you know,
I see it daily where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And boy, it's a hard time to get these
farmers to listen to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always get some that listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some that succeed, but the rest
don't even want to look at that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, because their worldview,
just they're just not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we need to look more at
organic tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, there's a demand right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just came back from a few months
or two ago to Salinas Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the big buyers like Costco and
Boyle and Walmart and all these big
[SPEAKER_02]: produce companies, their customers are
starting to demand organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the public, about 86 percent of the
buying public would prefer organic
[SPEAKER_02]: produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really coming on strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now the big players that buy a lot of
produce are starting to demand organic
[SPEAKER_02]: production from these big, big growers
like in Salinas, you know, that grow all
[SPEAKER_02]: the lettuce and spinach and grapes and you
name it, strawberries and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of our products is being used
down there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're seeing a big change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been waiting for a long time for
this, believe me, a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're seeing a shift towards organic,
even within the, well, even within the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we have quite a few people
growing cannabis organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And outside, sungrown, like the Oregon
Sungrown Growers Guild and people in
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington, you know, Eastern Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as I'm concerned, the quality
factors are there, just like in organic
[SPEAKER_02]: produce in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor, you know, nutrient content,
all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, organic approach is just
superior in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thought would be that for people
that are growing organically and want to
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate humic acids into their into
their application schedule with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: applying humates or humic and fulvic acids
to the soil would be a way of helping
[SPEAKER_00]: increase, I assume, terpene production by
helping make some of these trace minerals
[SPEAKER_00]: more plant available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and more and more than that,
because the way these humic substances
[SPEAKER_02]: work, for instance, the fulvic acid,
this really gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with transcript profiling and
the expression of genetic expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, there are specific
components within the lignans,
[SPEAKER_02]: tannin, polyphenol groups that switch on
genetic pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is something we've only known in
the last couple of years, two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: years, from German research researchers at
Humboldt University in Berlin that I work
[SPEAKER_02]: with that have tested my products.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we've tested our products in the
aeroponic and hydroponic labs at Humboldt
[SPEAKER_02]: University of Berlin, Germany,
and the results are just sure to
[SPEAKER_02]: spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: But additionally, they found out that how
these products are working at such minute
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts is that they're actually tripping
genetic pathways and they know which genes
[SPEAKER_02]: are being tripped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are pathways for growth
regulators, resistance pathways,
[SPEAKER_02]: other pathways like insulin-like pathways,
on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a mode of action that we never
had a clue because we don't even have the
[SPEAKER_02]: science of molecular genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know about the substances that
turn on, switch on resistance and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the kind of stuff that's going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, I mean, it's on a cellular level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could determine it with a single cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need a stable form of humus to do
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, we're back to that
business of long-term composting and
[SPEAKER_02]: curing of the compost so that these
precursor compounds like lignans can go
[SPEAKER_02]: through the changes to polyphenols,
specific tannins, specific known
[SPEAKER_02]: components that affect genetic expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is new stuff, big time new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not being done in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I was a cannabis grower and I wanted
to use fulvic acid in my regimen,
[SPEAKER_00]: how would I apply that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would I apply it in conjunction with
things like the seaweed extract powder or
[SPEAKER_00]: unsulfured blackstrap molasses or with
other higher nutrient content things like
[SPEAKER_00]: bat guanos that are soluble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it best applied by itself and having
those ingredients or nutrients already in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it's best to start with a soil
that has the basic nutrients in the basic
[SPEAKER_02]: right balance because humic substances do
not provide nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They provide increased uptake of nutrients
because they stimulate root growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make the cell membrane more permeable
so the plant can absorb more nutrients and
[SPEAKER_02]: they have effect chelation of phosphate,
but it doesn't supply nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to get the optimum results,
and believe me, the optimum results can be
[SPEAKER_02]: enormous more than most people imagine,
especially with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to have the nutrient pack get
you present.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the humic substances just
stimulate the uptake in the cellular
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolism, the protein proton donor
acceptor concept, and all these cell
[SPEAKER_02]: division is increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mitochondria are power energized,
you might say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really got to think cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cellular.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cellular thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what's molasses going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's just going to turn into
alcohol or an organic acid in the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just like you take some
grapes and juice them and just let it sit
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's going to turn into wine because
yeast are present and they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: take that sugar and they're going to
convert it to alcohol or they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: convert it to vinegar, depending on what
microorganisms you're involved with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things like molasses and all can
provide a little bit of trace elements and
[SPEAKER_02]: it can provide energy for microbes,
but it's not really going to do much for a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, wouldn't that increase in biological
activity in turn increase your nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I found unsulfured blackstrap
molasses to be one of the best food
[SPEAKER_00]: sources or balanced food sources for
bacteria, archaea, fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we know sugar is an energy source,
sure, for something, but it just doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: matter of who.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's an energy source for?
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, for fungi, a better energy
source for fungi like we use in the
[SPEAKER_02]: mushroom industry is oil, vegetable oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the energy source for fungal
biomass, not sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sugars can go, like I say, most of the
time it's going to be yeast that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to utilize the sugars and fast,
pretty rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but then the yeast is producing B
vitamins and that could stimulate fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very complicated, but like in a
hydroponic media, you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You absolutely don't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of our work was done with
aeroponics where you just have the roots
[SPEAKER_02]: hanging down there in a mist and then we
could just add the basic nutrients as per
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponics, your NPK, your trace element
as a control and then we'd be adding like
[SPEAKER_02]: M7, Cytoplus, which is gut kelp or the
straight fulvic acid and then determine
[SPEAKER_02]: the results statistically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where are we getting our best results?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the fulvic acid because that's the
low molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only fraction or part of humic
substances or humic acid that can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: be absorbed by the plant root.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything else can be negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So humic substances, which are the black
stuff in aeroponics or hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_02]: if used excessively can reduce plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know basically what works and what
works is keeping the levels of fulvic acid
[SPEAKER_02]: at about 15 parts per million or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like from the time that first the
seed germinates and we use it for cloning
[SPEAKER_02]: too, for root cloning is terrifically
quick effect on root growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matter of fact, the only substance in
nature, I mean, natural organic that can
[SPEAKER_02]: stimulate root growth is fulvic acid,
low molecular weight with the right
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're getting into variation
between deposits.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very important information that
you cannot generalize about humic acids or
[SPEAKER_02]: the deposits that they're used to
formulate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done tests on eight different humic
acid deposits in the U S and it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just amazing the differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of them will stimulate root
growth, but not shoot growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them will stimulate shoot growth,
but not root growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them do nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them have a negative effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are two of them, two of them
stimulate both root growth and shoot
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a gigantic difference in these
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is really a big unknown why that
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've determined now the reasons,
you know, and it has to do with,
[SPEAKER_02]: has pretty arcane, pretty complex
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about functional groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Russians know which are the
positive functional groups present and
[SPEAKER_02]: what are the negatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they score by subtracting the
negative from the positives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they come up with a number like 86%
bioactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those, the humates that are bioactive,
that are effective, they're characterized
[SPEAKER_02]: by high aromaticity.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, have a high level of
aromatic groups and then specific
[SPEAKER_02]: carboxylic and phenolic compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is all new information too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The humates aren't just humates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even within a given mine, you go a little
deeper or a little bit off the deposit and
[SPEAKER_02]: the results can be, you know, you have a
product that doesn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why it's so important,
you know, who you're dealing with,
[SPEAKER_02]: the brand that you're dealing with,
or do your own testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we're still back to using corn,
sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I started 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: with sweet corn and bottom line,
all these new tests that we're doing with
[SPEAKER_02]: bioassays and trying to functional groups
and trying to correlate them with shoot
[SPEAKER_02]: growth, root growth and all that stuff,
still comes back to sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the only way you can tell is by
what a plant actually does.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have, we can kind of do a very
expensive and complex organic functional
[SPEAKER_02]: group analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of, you know, narrow it down a
little bit, but it really comes down to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually that simple plant test,
you know, where I'd soak the seed and
[SPEAKER_02]: different concentrations of different
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could tell right pretty quick,
you know, what the root growth was doing
[SPEAKER_02]: because only like the only thing that will
stimulate root growth is fulvic acid,
[SPEAKER_02]: a low molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that doesn't happen, you don't have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, in all our aeroponic and
hydroponic tests, pure hydroponic,
[SPEAKER_02]: pure aeroponic, you only need the fulvic
acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't any benefits from the TM7,
from the cytoplasm, there was benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I mean, over the control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, big time, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the best results,
you've pretty much got the results just
[SPEAKER_02]: from the gold stuff or the fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nothing else was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now soils is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soils is a system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different system than hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, in the soil, the humic substances
can actually degrade down to fulvic
[SPEAKER_02]: substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what happens in composting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over time, the black stuff or the humic
further degrades, you know, by fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: activity to a lower molecular weight
fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really why it's so important,
you know, the old idea of well-rotted or
[SPEAKER_02]: aged or cured compost, because there's
your time factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what takes the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That downsizing of the molecule,
the molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you just add that basically our
product at one to 200 to hydroponics all
[SPEAKER_02]: the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep it in there day one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through the whole process,
because we know that that is absolutely a
[SPEAKER_02]: requirement for normal cellular activity
and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be there all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the living bridge between the dead
mineral and the living plant root,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, because basically hydroponics is
using dead, you know, using salts,
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our, most of our growers are going
to be growing in soil, hopefully is my
[SPEAKER_00]: goal, because I think it's a more
sustainable option long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really fortunate here in
Washington to have good compost sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the one that we use is a two to three
year aged fish compost, which I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty happy with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I forget, one thing I wanted to
go back and touch on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, another thing I should have
brought this up, vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_02]: In all these trials we did with eight
different humic substances, one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: substances we use in these trials is
vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you could see parallels there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vermicompost had the similar effects
to the best humates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like personally for my own growing,
I have a vermicompost bed out here,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I throw stuff in and waste
materials in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had like, on a crop this year,
I used that vermicompost that had been out
[SPEAKER_02]: there for six or seven years, you know,
and the results we have are just
[SPEAKER_02]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can make your own humic substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really need to buy them from me,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earthworms are definitely play a part in
all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And vermicompost is, yeah, that's
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a crucial factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, if you stimulate earthworm
activity in the soil, you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_02]: that anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just like, I mean, the whole idea of
earthworms, I mean, you can't discount
[SPEAKER_02]: that, how crucial that all is,
you know, and that's why I say once you
[SPEAKER_02]: see earthworms in the compost,
then it's ready to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny that you mentioned that because
worm castings is something, or
[SPEAKER_00]: vermicomposting has come up in pretty much
every single one of my podcast episodes so
[SPEAKER_00]: far, everyone wants to talk about them
because of all the benefits that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I wanted to touch on with
you before we go any further, we talked a
[SPEAKER_00]: little, you talked a little about compost
teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I found,
so I did some experiments using humic
[SPEAKER_00]: acids and in compost, compost teas,
where I had a control using compost and
[SPEAKER_00]: distilled water, and then I added some of
these humic substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried your TM7, and then I tried some of
the products from Terra Vida, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with them, their SP85,
and their LC10 plus seven, which is sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of a liquid chelate version of the TM7.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found was I had a touch of some
of the control actually had higher
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial activity than the ones that I
added the humic substances to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you remembered,
but I was talking about this once at
[SPEAKER_00]: CannaCon in a presentation, and you came
up to me afterwards and said something
[SPEAKER_00]: along the lines of, yeah, those results
didn't really surprise me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now in this talk, you're saying that
the TM7 you found increases microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: activity in teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just curious, what your thoughts
are on it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's about concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, TM7 in a solution is
alkaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can have, as it stands, in its form,
you get it, and it's got a pH of over 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's an alkaline form of humic
substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that can affect an important factor in
that culture, in other words, the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're increasing the salts, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: People tend to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things are effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, we don't recommend a
solution any stronger than what looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: iced tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's like one gram per gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not so much how much you use,
but what the concentration is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're in the neighborhood of about up
to three grams per gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not black.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, these substances can take
things two different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, a lot of the German work
now on these humic substances has to do
[SPEAKER_02]: with health benefits, longevity effects,
and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use the term hormesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So humic substances are a poison at one
level, and a tonic in another.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the concept of hormesis,
that the stress provided from a small
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of a poison stimulates a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't disagree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that from my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, you're going to see a
decrease in bacterial activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what we showed in the tests
I did last summer in the greenhouse with
[SPEAKER_02]: soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We start out with the control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bacterial levels drop way down,
and the fungal levels go way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, that's what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want the bacterial activity to be
reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or not reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to see fungal activity is
dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because bacteria can't take apart
cellulose or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really have much of a key
laying effect or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the metabolites produced by fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their ability to digest organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas bacteria don't, can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need the help of fungi first.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can take sugars.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacteria can directly utilize sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fungi can produce sugars from
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: From lignans and carbohydrates and just
cellulose, as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The right fungi can produce sugars from
cellulose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, you're going to notice a
decrease in bacterial activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I didn't see that increase in
fungal activity, though, either.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in the teas themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not suggesting that humic acids
or humic products don't have a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits like you've already mentioned in
this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just found, personally, I've had
better success applying them separate from
[SPEAKER_00]: my compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of things that can
be going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's kind of complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: How that could go down, you know,
depending on what raw materials you're
[SPEAKER_02]: using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a whole range of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whole range of issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just gets very complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then really, until you put that
compost tea on the soil, and then a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of other things are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's added to the soil and,
you know, changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you know what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humic substances, organic matter,
and soil microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most complex chemistry in
nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that in humic acid or so-called
humic acid, this is recent research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a paper published last fall
using the Fortier exchange of
[SPEAKER_02]: electrospray, you know, some new technique
of determining, you know, particular
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds and something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's over 800 different compounds
identified within, I mean, let's say dots
[SPEAKER_02]: on the electrospray graph.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we don't know what the names are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they fall within, you know,
polyphenols and phenols and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: carboxylates and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there can be actually as
many as 8,000 different compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's extremely complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, when you're talking about
humicrophobic acid, you're not talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about a specific substance at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about a fraction,
an acidic fraction that may have several
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand different compounds, you know,
because, you know, all the things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: claimed, all the benefits for humic acid,
fulvic acid, how can one compound do all
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have substances there that
are chelators.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have some that are antimicrobial.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have some that stimulate different
genetic pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just, you know, we're just at the
beginnings of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know there's thousands of,
see, they used to for years, they used to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to determine what is the formula,
the molecular diagram for humic acid or
[SPEAKER_02]: fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spent years trying to figure that one
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're down to no, no,
no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a soup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it varies tremendously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there's thousands of individual
compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, to be able to say that this thing did
that or this thing did that, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a level of complexity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is just overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's why we stick to,
like in hydroponics, just the fulvic acid,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's the low molecular weight
that's absorbed by plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to interfere with
anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a chelator in itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start throwing humic acid in there,
the black stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, that can combine with
other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can have, it can have methylene groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's stuff associated with oil and coal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Methylene, that's toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this varies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you're not necessarily sure
what's going on here, see?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why I say, okay,
the part that has the bang, the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: bang for the buck is the so-called fulvic
fraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is our product called Full Power.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and we have the first label on the
west coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here in Oregon, they finally allowed
us to call it fulvic acid because a new
[SPEAKER_02]: test method has been developed and
approved by some different regulatory
[SPEAKER_02]: bodies and now accepted by Oregon
Department of Ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, hopefully the rest of the
states will follow suit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we can actually even define is only in
the last year we could actually define
[SPEAKER_02]: fulvic acid, let alone all the goodies
that it has in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're the only one that's been able to
do that, actually get a label,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, actually get through all the
testing requirements, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy metals, all the things that they
require to register.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to do with molecular weight and
all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, when you start getting into something
that has 8,000, as many as 8,000 different
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds in it that vary tremendously,
it's hard to predict what's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen exactly, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then concentrations are crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I say, it's toxic at one level and
beneficial at another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my hope is that people that listen
to this podcast will take away that if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing in hydroponics,
they should just try the fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're using soil, like most of us
are, they can also incorporate humates and
[SPEAKER_00]: humic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can make their own by managing their
own compost pile and taking care of their
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully realize that they need to
try high quality products and brands like
[SPEAKER_00]: yours, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not just sourcing these things
on eBay because they're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: contain the same constituents and
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, that we're just really
fortunate to be in an industry where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much left to learn and everyone
should be doing their own trials and
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific method to find out what works
best for them with their soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, this isn't a guessing
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I see a lot of people try to
grow that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they all, I think it needs a
little amino acids today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it needs a little of this,
you know, like what you think is
[SPEAKER_02]: meaningless.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's what the plant wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why you have to look at
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, okay, let's try this on the
control versus the treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what's really happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, all this fancy science
we've got now, you know, it's developing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it still comes back to like getting
some seeds and soaking them in the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: and seeing how quick they germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we did stuff here with Oregon
State University seed lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so where we just take fescue seed
treated at different rates of fulvic acid
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what's the speed of germination?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so at one to one thousand dilution
of full power, we get statistically
[SPEAKER_02]: significant increases in seed germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, that's definitive fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you can literally just soak
some seeds in a one to one hundred or one
[SPEAKER_02]: to one thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't see any difference
between the control and the treatment,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, then you don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be just take a week or so,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you let the plant tell you
the plant needs to tell us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't really tell the plant what it
needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tells us what it needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so reading the plant,
the color, the vigor, the root
[SPEAKER_02]: development, like, for instance,
without using humic substances or fulvic
[SPEAKER_02]: acid, the root system is what I call
stringy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a stringy root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just stringy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so when you use the fulvic acid,
real fulvic acid, the morphology of the
[SPEAKER_02]: root is fibrous.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of root hair development,
and it's dramatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you can do your own trials and
just, you know, wash the roots off,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, use a potting mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have humic substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like pro mix or something like
that, something that's inert pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you're either going to have
it or you're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's either going to, if you have
a stringy root system, well, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, because the real thing is going
to give you a fibrous, very, very
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatically fibrous root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, the shoot growth will
be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people just notice that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really go to, but you need to
wash the roots off and take a look at
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that's still the bottom
line on how to determine whether these
[SPEAKER_02]: things are effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can take it to the lab with that
idea of the soil food web analysis and
[SPEAKER_02]: take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you add humic substances,
the black stuff, you know, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: what we call ful-humic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ful-humic is a soluble powder that has the
whole range.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the fulvic, the humic, the ulvic,
the ulmic, all the various humic
[SPEAKER_02]: substances and minerals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's been removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: See these other products, they'll just
dissolve it in alkali and then settle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, you just get the one
humic fraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our products, nothing's been removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what the soil needs because the
various microbes can utilize that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can, you know, start to break out
organic matter and form more humic
[SPEAKER_02]: substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: It forms a colloid that affects the soil
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest, most important part of what
humic does, that's the black stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: is soil structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the difference between a brick and
friable soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's not an issue that,
it's an issue in hydroponics, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but it's crucial in any kind of other,
you know, growing activity in soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because once the structure is gone,
it's time to go to town and get a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you've got cement.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Willamette Valley is a good example of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, so these substances have a range of
benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in soil structure, in other
words, the first humate I used was called
[SPEAKER_02]: Claude Buster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil softener supreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil softener supreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't know how it did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we sell our product called Full
Humics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell it to municipal use, like sports
turf, like these football fields,
[SPEAKER_02]: golf courses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the big universities here use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use it on their, you know, football
fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guys are saying, wow, yeah,
the ground's softer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we fall, you know,
we're not bouncing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the ground is softened and all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you really want to think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is the humic feeds the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fulvic feeds the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank you again for your
time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we covered quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping people will go out and try
using some of these humic substances in
[SPEAKER_00]: their gardens and see what sort of effects
they get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I mean, it's almost a formula
that's going to work every time,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, assuming, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the important part is to stick to the
label and that more isn't better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, that's a problem farmers
may have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they see a result and they
think, oh, more is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in this case.
[SPEAKER_02]: More ain't better.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've developed that curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what rates, what concentrations
will get us, you know, to where we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we know that it'll reach a point
where you don't get any more benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it plateaus off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you use more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts to go on the other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's almost homeopathic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're talking about things that
affect cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cellular, you know, response,
molecular genetics does not require,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, more is not better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like adding nitrogen or something
where you just get more and more growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned from Jamaicans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also studied in Jamaica because they're
a pretty good example of sustainable ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those folks in the cockpit
country, the real Rasta people,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're very, you know, they're
particularly effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they consider on cannabis,
okay, oh, God, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They consider chemical fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is a quote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes the plant mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, so you ask them, what's the best you
got?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the best stuff you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: Goat shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a term for high grade
cannabis in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Goat shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the highest quality cannabis is
grown using goat manure or bat,
[SPEAKER_02]: rat bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, bat guano.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use chemical fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes the plant mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which they mean it makes it, you know,
a lot of top growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, vigorous, you know, male energy,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you just get a leggy, tall plant,
but it doesn't give you what you're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to get, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's learning from people that have
been doing this for quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're considering using
chemical fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it just makes the plant mad,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to use organic methods,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants only need a little bite every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's to use some of these hydro
formulas and some of the stuff people are
[SPEAKER_02]: doing with commercial fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like feeding a man all he can
eat on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he doesn't get any food.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't get anything to eat till next
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need a little bite every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Dr. Robert Faust of BioEgg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their company's website is www.bioag.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to use the coupon code

[SPEAKER_00]: That's H-U-M-A-T-E for 10% off all humic
acid products for a short time following
