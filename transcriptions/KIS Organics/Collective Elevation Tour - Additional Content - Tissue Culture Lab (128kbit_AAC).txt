[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so as you can imagine, this is the
most sterile environment on the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our head of extraction, he went to MSU
and got his plant science degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he kind of started off with this,
but then, you know, he, as the company
[SPEAKER_01]: grew, you know, we got, he got pulled more
into the extraction side and there wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole lot of time for him to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably a few months ago, we just,
uh, hired a girl from MSU, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a plant biology degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's kind of coming in under the,
his ropes and he's kind of teaching her
[SPEAKER_01]: all the nuances of the tissue culture lab
and she's kind of running with it right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're excited to actually, you know,
get somebody in here who has the time and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the main purpose, uh, just to speed
up your propagation or is it to get
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaner, cleaner, cleaner plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I would say definitely cleaner
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also kind of like a, you know,
genetic bank, you know, we, there's a few
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that, you know, aren't selling
much at the time being, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can kind of keep them on reserve in
here for a while until maybe we'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: another run of it and see if it's a great
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually, you know, looking pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, you can peek inside there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This past winter and summer, um,
we did some breeding of our own and are
[SPEAKER_01]: really trying to get a strain that,
um, finishes really early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because as you can imagine,
Montana, you know, whether, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can have, you know, snow in middle of
September, you know, I've seen snow end of
[SPEAKER_01]: August.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so some of our breeding projects,
we actually harvested about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say four weeks ago, um,
which was really exciting, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how big were the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, they're, they're nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they weren't huge, but,
you know, and some, we started a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit later than others, you know,
somewhere about this big and somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: about this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, and all that's going to go
towards, uh, just biomass for extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: right now until we kind of, um,
get the ball rolling and kind of get
[SPEAKER_01]: everything honed in a little bit more on
the genetics side.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, uh, quite a bit of variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, yeah, so I'm excited for next
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be cool to kind of hone that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tissue culture lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in a 40 foot container out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love the shipping containers out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
