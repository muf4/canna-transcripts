[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Colin Bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin is the co-founder, co-inventor,
and chief growth officer at Grossentia,
[SPEAKER_00]: parent company of Mammoth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin completed his PhD in soil microbial
ecology in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a research scientist at Colorado State
University, Colin published dozens of
[SPEAKER_00]: peer-reviewed publications that were
focused on eliciting microbial mediated
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that enhance plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin left his academic position at
Colorado State University in March 2015 to
[SPEAKER_00]: launch Mammoth, a young company in the ag
tech sector that develops microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: biostimulants to sustainably increase
plant yield and an all-natural biocontrol
[SPEAKER_00]: product to prevent pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their first product, Mammoth P,
is a beneficial bacterial bloom stimulant
[SPEAKER_00]: that targets phosphorous cycling to
maximize both quality and yield in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Colin, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tad, hey, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great talking to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm excited to have you on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known you for a long time,
and we've chatted and become friends
[SPEAKER_00]: through this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to get you on to talk a
little bit about microbes, since that's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of what your background is in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, microbes are my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a perfect topic for us to discuss
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, can we start off by giving listeners
a little idea of your own background,
[SPEAKER_00]: going back maybe into college?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from an academic and college
perspective, I ended up getting a PhD in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really a speciality in
microbial ecology, which is the study of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes in the environment, mostly how
they integrate with plants and if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of interact with climate as well on
some level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a desert microbial ecologist for
years and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a lot of work in the Chihuahuan
Desert, and I did some work in the Great
[SPEAKER_01]: Basin and different parts of the
Chihuahuan Desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I was looking at, we did a lot of
climate change studies in my research as a
[SPEAKER_01]: student.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in professional, in my
professional career, I worked for the USDA
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Agriculture, Agriculture
Research Services.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the USDA ARS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for the Forest Service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I worked for Colorado State
University at the Natural Resource Ecology
[SPEAKER_01]: Lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost all the projects I was employed
in, in those different organizations,
[SPEAKER_01]: were relating not only effects of climate
change, but those effects and how
[SPEAKER_01]: plant-microbe interactions responded to
climate scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have a longstanding career in
understanding how microbes interact with
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, not only in natural settings,
but also in agriculture settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been geeking out on this,
holy moly for almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to talk a little bit
about how you founded the company and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you already brought up some really
interesting questions for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I'm curious about
is how do microbes differ different in
[SPEAKER_00]: these various regions geographically?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what sort of persistence do you
see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I guess when I was I got to go to
the soil science meeting a couple of years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago now, and one of the things that they
talked about was how microbial populations
[SPEAKER_00]: will differ just from watering or
hydrology will change the populations
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit in over a fairly short period
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were you seeing sort of on a macro
scale with these microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot of great work on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can look up some of it also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking to the listeners here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbial biogeography is kind of the
study of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how they're dispersed across a large
geography, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it really comes down to,
and this comes back to the very
[SPEAKER_01]: fundamentals of microbiology 101.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the environment selects that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in all these microbial biogeography
studies, what you're going to find is the
[SPEAKER_01]: only way to look to correlate why
microbial communities and communities is
[SPEAKER_01]: assemblage of multiple species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so microbes don't exist as isolates or
a single species in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They exist as a community or consortia,
just to be clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're looking at microbes and how
their relative abundances form a broader
[SPEAKER_01]: community or the total microbial biomass
within any region.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's typically how these questions are
framed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're looking at the environmental
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be soil textures have a big a
big part to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's sand, soap, clay, and they have
different hydrology properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's these interactions,
more importantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's pH, which is a biggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Noah Fierro is one of my favorite
microbial ecology scientists of all time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's here at University of Colorado in
Boulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a lot of great science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could probably make an
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should get him on the show sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, he's smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's done a lot of this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he found was more than any one
factor pH significantly shifts microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: community assemblage across a wide
geographic region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there's a lot of factors that
control environmental factors that
[SPEAKER_01]: interact to actually control and form
these environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think about biodiversity to add from
the equator.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a plant perspective, it's been well
studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving outward towards the poles,
you get more diverse diversity at the
[SPEAKER_01]: center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it narrows as you get to the
poles because environment selects plant
[SPEAKER_01]: species and more hospitable environments
allow for more diversity and more biomass
[SPEAKER_01]: and more climate and more and more
cohabitation, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as we go up through North
America, through Canada, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get fewer species because the
environment is that much harsher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can think about that from a
microbial perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not on that scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on a micro scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these edaphic, which are soil
properties, and temperature and hydrology
[SPEAKER_01]: are the main properties that influence
microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to overlay one extra
interaction, and that's plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: because microbes in soil around the world
interact and cohabitate very well with
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in the rhizosphere or root zone,
because those are nice food sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so another layer that controls
biodiversity is actually how plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: different plant species might be feeding
microbial communities within their
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere or within their root zone in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's a lot to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, if you were to bring a
plant, then I'm thinking into a regional
[SPEAKER_00]: community that would have a pretty
dramatic effect on the biology in that
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would have a dramatic effect
potentially in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So microbes occur in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me layer this one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was obsessed for a while academically
as a research scientist of how plants
[SPEAKER_01]: might be able to engineer unique
rhizosphere microbial communities,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the microbes in their root zone,
to support plant success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the examples that I was
hypothesizing were invasive species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked with cheatgrass for a while,
because it was an interesting grass
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an invasive grass species that's
spread across North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that great of a forage for
cattle, but it was introduced by humans
[SPEAKER_01]: because it grew quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it greened up quick in the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was planted to try and feed cattle
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened is it dries earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it chokes out other later season
grasses, ultimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't a good choice to introduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's spread across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the hypotheses, and I've published
this work now, and I could probably share
[SPEAKER_01]: this paper with you for sure, is for this
cheatgrass engineer to have a unique
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere microbe as it spreads through
different soil types to nurture its
[SPEAKER_01]: success and help promote its ability to
create seeds, to create biomass,
[SPEAKER_01]: to maybe compete below ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it even has a stronger competitive
advantage from a physiological point of
[SPEAKER_01]: view.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did conduct that study in some
native grasslands, and not only in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, but also replicated it in
greenhouse studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we realized that different grass
species and different photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: groups, C3, C4, some Forbes species,
and even some cam species, are able to
[SPEAKER_01]: uniquely engineer different microbial
community assemblages at some level with
[SPEAKER_01]: their root exudates and the root
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other physical properties of pH,
maybe a soil texture, and temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrology also influence that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hear a lot of talk about fungal to
bacterial ratios in soils and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that almost feels too reductionist to
me in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you're essentially saying is
that, in your example here, this grass is
[SPEAKER_00]: able to change the microbial populations
or communities in the soil around the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere, making it more hospitable for
this one grass and less hospitable for
[SPEAKER_00]: other grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm understanding correctly,
would you say then that if we want to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at this from a broader perspective that
that might be challenging to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: we really have to identify the actual
consortia with each particular plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species and the impact it has on soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I totally missing the point here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you saying relative taking it one step
to a higher resolution than just using
[SPEAKER_01]: growth fungal to bacterial ratios?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're trying to make the
comparison for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not explaining this very
accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, what I'm trying to get at
is that we have a lot of people claiming
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you get the fungal to bacterial
ratios correct, or if you use these
[SPEAKER_00]: specific indigenous microbes, you may get
certain impacts on plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, that feels a little,
a little squishy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know exactly what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm finding is that there's so
much in the range when we say the word
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria or archaea.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much we still don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much that falls into those
kingdoms that can we really make those
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of comparisons at that macro level
or macro scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can make them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's about defining the assumptions
and what data you can actually get from
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what you're saying is a really
fair statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to use fungal bacterial ratios to
assess as one measure of assessing plant
[SPEAKER_01]: health across different ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you're like, oh,
this might look interesting, but it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: limiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until you dive in, like you suggested,
to the actual contributors of those fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: populations and those bacterial
populations or communities more
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically, assemblages of different
fungal species, assemblages of different
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial bacterial species, you're going
to have limited information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is fungi have
different functional groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some arbuscular mycorrhizal groups
that perform specific functions as
[SPEAKER_01]: symbionts to engage in specific plant
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a lot of plant specificity
here where specific fungal species of
[SPEAKER_01]: arbuscular mycorrhizae are only really
associated with certain grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And echomycorrhizae is another example
where there's some real specificity of
[SPEAKER_01]: those host plants to these fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other fungi do a very good job of
decomposing and breaking down organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those functional groups are pretty
typical of fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the bacterial world, there's a lot
more functional group specificity,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning that there are certain groups of
bacteria that are very specific for known
[SPEAKER_01]: for delivering or cycling nitrogen or
phosphorus or other nutrients or doing
[SPEAKER_01]: more specific functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you really have to know what's
there to form, again, what I was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: say is to form a robust hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any kind of data or any kind of
science, if it's good, it's really just
[SPEAKER_01]: generating more data.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are better questions that you can
address in new studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the iterative process of
science and the scientific method.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have these hypothesis, these guesses
that we hope resemble some form of
[SPEAKER_01]: reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the answers that we get,
we're going to ask new questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to test those new
questions via hypothesis through new
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of a never-ending cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of enjoy that never-ending cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do as much experimental science as
I used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it led me down many really great paths
of understanding how microbes are engaging
[SPEAKER_01]: with different plants and in desert
systems or more music grassland systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of just forms my perspective
of how nature performs and functions,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least on some level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as a scientist, I actually think
about everything from a microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's healthy or not,
but I can't help it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the scale that I think then I kind
of extrapolated up from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that a ratio of fungal to
bacteria in soil will influence the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we typically see certain ratios
associated with the types of plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of like a plant succession table
that we see in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see higher levels of fungal
activity in forests over grasslands,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm wondering is, can we take
that data and extrapolate it any further?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds to me, and from my own just
online research, it appears to me that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant really controls that relationship
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the strongest variables in
determining microbial populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: more so than what a lot of people try to
do when they try to add specific microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: or try and make compost teas that contain
more bacteria than fungi, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the plant is really the
driver of that microbial community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree with that, or what do you
think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know there's so many variables,
like you mentioned, and it's really the
[SPEAKER_00]: functional consortia that we're going for
when we're trying to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do you see as the real driver
there in that system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little conceptually here, you think
about even desert systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very, very much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungal bacterial ratios are all relative
to abundance of fungi versus bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in natural systems in general,
and in all terrestrial systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're typically going to have higher
all-natural terrestrial ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have higher fungal
bacterial ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you are obviously in aquatic systems,
because fungi don't thrive in aquatic
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you are in agriculture systems,
because agriculture systems are very harsh
[SPEAKER_01]: over time on the natural microbial flora
of the soil for several reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the chemical inputs,
because of the physical tilling,
[SPEAKER_01]: and other aspects of management,
human management, that really break down
[SPEAKER_01]: and influence microbial biodiversity and
microbial assemblages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungi, the way they grow, they hate
tilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't till soils year after year and
maintain significant communities and
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy fungal abundances in those soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why in natural systems,
they persist from year after year,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can live off of the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say that in general,
you can create different microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: assemblages through different food
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is what you're getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't want to relate it to the plant
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can have a soil sample that I take from
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm great at growing microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can create 10 different food
sources, just broth, which is just like a
[SPEAKER_01]: soup, a sugar soup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I'll drive that sugar soup from
beets or carrots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll make another broth or media.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we'd call it in microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has different sugar sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I'll make another media that has
a carbon source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sugar is carbon, so we're tying these
kind of words together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes need carbon, nitrogen,
phosphorus, sulfur, all the
[SPEAKER_01]: macronutrients, just like plants do for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants need all those other nutrients as
well, but they get their carbon from the
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only difference in how they
acquire those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a media that's rich of
carbon and all the nutrients, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: different chemical compositions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I had the same soil sample,
and maybe I made a slurry where I mixed a
[SPEAKER_01]: gram of soil with 10 mils of water and
mixed it up, and I aliquoted a drop of
[SPEAKER_01]: each of the same sample onto those 10
different media dishes, what do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: the result would be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of those medias would nurture
different aspects of the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: community from that initial sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's potentially tens of
thousands of different microbes in that
[SPEAKER_01]: one sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we're using one soil sample,
one scoop of soil, one spoonful of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix it in some water and drop it on 10
different easily accessible food sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to get 10 different
results potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food source is a huge determinant of what
microbes are going to be nurtured and
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And microbial abundances is at some level
a probability game.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a food source that a microbial
group likes and prefers and can take
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage of more so than another,
microbes repeat and grow and multiply so
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly that they can actually physically
outcompete their neighboring microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: because they can take advantage of a food
source quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing happens with different food
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so different plants, we know they
create different food sources for
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes, meaning they score different
carbons and different organic acids from
[SPEAKER_01]: their roots into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: All plants have evolved to do this,
to nurture microbial communities that
[SPEAKER_01]: bring them success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Success meaning you want a healthy,
thriving microbial community in the root
[SPEAKER_01]: zone because microbes do a lot of great
things that plants love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cyclone nutrients is one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can create a hotbed of nutrients
that plants can take up, they will
[SPEAKER_01]: succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be able to produce seed or produce
or stay healthy to the next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And biology, success in biology is passing
your genome to the subsequent generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so typically, evolutionarily speaking,
plants that are here now have succeeded
[SPEAKER_01]: because they've nurtured a healthy
rhizostera microbiome that's helped them
[SPEAKER_01]: succeed from one generation to the next
since the very beginning of their
[SPEAKER_01]: existence to today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that help answer that question or is
that too long?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me so I think essentially what
you're equating is food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this case, the food source is
the plant exudates what the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out through the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't want to minimize the other
edaphic or physical properties because
[SPEAKER_01]: soil texture, pH, water sources,
there's different minerals in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that significantly affect pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think about calcareous soils where
there's a lot more calcium and cleetia in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to create a very basic
alkaline soil that the plants are not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this layer, this parent
material layer and soil layer that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are growing in that aren't
affecting pH as much as their rhizostera,
[SPEAKER_01]: their hotbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the microbes that grow better in an
alkaline environment along with the food
[SPEAKER_01]: sources that the plants are feeding them
are going to be strongly influenced and
[SPEAKER_01]: succeed better than microbes that do
better at neutral or acidic soils with
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a different food source or even the
same food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's multiple layers of
interactions, physical and biotic,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have to kind of conceive
holistically to understand the life of a
[SPEAKER_01]: microbe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's getting food squirted on it and
there's all these physical pressures and
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and hydrology and pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know why pH is a factor for
microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk about that for a sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, before we do though, I just want to
highlight one of the things I've found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what you're saying is
taking the same source, and I've done this
[SPEAKER_00]: with compost tea, I'll take the same
compost source or earthworm castings and
[SPEAKER_00]: add unsulfured molasses or add alfalfa
meal or some other food source,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, and you end up with very
different things under the microscope 8,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, 24 hours later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go longer than that,
I've found if people ask about brewing
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea for a long time or can I leave
it perpetually brewing, what I find,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the best analogy I've come up
with to date, but it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's like this idea that if you
opened up all the gates in a zoo,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the day, you'd have your
apex predator, you'd have your lions and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd have probably some rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so that's all that's really left
at that point because you've lost all that
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're the most efficient
microbes at utilizing whatever food source
[SPEAKER_00]: or what lasts the longest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the case with compost tea,
all we're left with is one morphology of
[SPEAKER_00]: flagellate and one morphology of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just sort of fluctuate as they
prey and predate on each other over the
[SPEAKER_00]: next however long until the food sources
eventually run out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think that's a perfect way to talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not be saying that in those words,
but that's exactly what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're thinking about it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another level too,
I want to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a limited food source and
you're going to nurture only so many
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes that grow great at that food
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those microbes are going to get
more concentrated than the other microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't grow as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to layer in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens, not as much in teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grew the teas out longer,
this could happen, but also in soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you have fast-growing microbes,
you have moderately fast-growing microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have slow-growing microbes,
and you have very slow-growing microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there can be a succession event
where those different microbial groups
[SPEAKER_01]: also favor different food sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can have, for fungi and
bacteria, layers of succession.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I like to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have this initial succession
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what would happen if you left the
tea going for a week or a month,
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't practical for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or for feeding, I wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the purposes of a microbial study,
you would see turnover in that fermenter
[SPEAKER_01]: or that tea vessel from one month to the
next until it finally stabilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because the environment and that
food source continues to turn around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to have life and death of
certain groups of microbes that ate the
[SPEAKER_01]: initially yummy, easily accessible carbon
in the tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they would die off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd have another microbial
group or groups of microbes that could
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of decompose and take in more easily
that next more concentrated or more
[SPEAKER_01]: recalcitrant food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an example of so many layers,
temporal and spatial and physical,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the microbes are experiencing that
might influence how we're growing microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: and how to grow them consistently,
which all of these things are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm kind of in the microbial
manufacturing business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to understand all those physical
and input properties to understand how to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow microbes with consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tea is a real tricky thing because
you have to have consistent inputs also,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you don't have that completely,
you're not going to get consistent results
[SPEAKER_01]: every time because it's going to be a
slightly different food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's why most research and
most scientists don't like compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I totally understand that it's
impossible to get consistency because even
[SPEAKER_00]: a different teaspoon of compost is going
to have a slightly different microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: consortia, which is going to lead to
slightly different responses to a given
[SPEAKER_00]: food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you mentioned, your temperature,
your water source, the amount of air,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dissolved oxygen levels in the tea
itself, there's so many variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand why compost tea isn't as
loved by the science world, though it has
[SPEAKER_00]: caught on a lot more, I will say,
over the last 15, 20 years since we first
[SPEAKER_00]: started experimenting with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Ted, I love compost teas and I
love the idea of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the practice of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to acknowledge the
limitations or to acknowledge what we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just hard to know everything in
that tea over time also, because the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes will actually change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did this in a study looking at different
natural systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbial communities can change
significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seasonally, just because of those
environmental shifts in temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: in hydrology, and in plant structure where
the plants die in the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so different microbes actually thrive
better and other microbes that thrive well
[SPEAKER_01]: in peak growth season in midsummer will
decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're gathering nutrients or
gathering inputs from your surroundings or
[SPEAKER_01]: your tea, if you know all that stuff,
you're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that you're at risk
because people love that, but you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that you're introducing
variability into cultivation if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using teas without consistent inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're using sources of compost or
other microbe sources that haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: thermally composted, then you are
potentially at risk for bringing in
[SPEAKER_00]: disease organisms as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is definitely a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely acknowledge that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the fact
that, like you mentioned, you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: business of producing microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You founded Mammoth Pea, which is a
consortia of microbes that are shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: stable and something that can be added in
to a reservoir or to someone that's
[SPEAKER_00]: watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few specific questions about
Mammoth Pea, but I want to share my
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth Pea experience first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was given a sample, oh, it was years ago
now, and I just left it sitting next to my
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope for probably about a month,
month and a half, and I don't know how old
[SPEAKER_00]: it was when I got that sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just threw it under the microscope one
day, and I was shocked to see motile
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only microbial product I've ever
seen on the market that actually has
[SPEAKER_00]: active microorganisms, which I know not
having motile bacteria doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it doesn't have nutrient cycling
properties, but I thought that was really
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was exciting to actually see something
moving around out of the microscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can talk about how we developed this
particular product, but these microbes are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually flagellated, so they are mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting to think about that
extra functionality.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of products in the market are a
bacillus species, quite frankly,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of them create these endospores.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not necessarily active,
and you have to activate them over a
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time, and they might be in a dry
or a liquid solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them carried in both,
but many times they're actually formulated
[SPEAKER_01]: or developed on the inshore or
non-vegetative state, and so it takes some
[SPEAKER_01]: more food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're engaging with plant roots to
actually get them going, so I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: why you don't necessarily see active
microbes in a lot of those other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't spent a lot of time looking
under a microscope in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved early on, remember we met,
and then you did some substrate work,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the same study you're talking
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on YouTube, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would say is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did was I just experimented with
different food sources to see about
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding the microorganisms and how they
would respond to different food sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that interested me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I see from most microbial products on
the market, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: is when I add different food sources,
I'll see a growth in overall bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass, but that's really about it,
which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not as exciting under a
microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I want to be clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth pee is bacteria, quite clearly,
but they have these morphology structures
[SPEAKER_01]: called flagella, which are simply little
tails that allow for mobility of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you knew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I originally thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I misheard you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flagella are actually a lot of... That's
how bacteria are mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have these little tails that
typically spin or they crank as
[SPEAKER_01]: corkscrews, and they allow them to move
through the substrate and move through the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhinosphere and the water columns or move
through the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really interesting level to add
whenever a bacteria is highly functional,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it can move around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can activate through different parts of
the rhinosphere or through the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when you're using microbes like this,
and this is what I determined over time,
[SPEAKER_01]: if there is some environmental stress and
you're dealing with mobile microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can actively get out of the way of
that stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: An example is like a pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if you forget to pH your
nutrients and you add the microbes and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not too harsh, and then you're trying
to pH your nutrients, and you're adding
[SPEAKER_01]: acid or a base into that, it can
potentially affect a lot of the microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: where that pH buffer enters into that mix
where your microbes are mixed in to the
[SPEAKER_01]: tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the microbes are mobile,
they actually get out of the way and don't
[SPEAKER_01]: experience that much stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cool added feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: With mammoth pee, what sorts of results
are you seeing out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: With people that are using it,
are there any environments where it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't do quite as well or are there
others where it really thrives?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably a never-ending question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that when we started, when we
launched the company, just as a history,
[SPEAKER_01]: I left the university in about March 2015
to start the company and we'd done a
[SPEAKER_01]: solid, a really rigorous year before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually started the R&D on the
technology at the university very late or
[SPEAKER_01]: very early.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2014, in all fairness, we were getting
ramped up to try to do something like this
[SPEAKER_01]: at the very end of 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got some funding and started it in 2014,
went through the process, got some great
[SPEAKER_01]: validation after we developed the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pretty efficient process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty well-funded and then
launched the company in March 2015 into
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I scaled up commercialization and
production and got a small team on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still, in a lot of ways,
wearing all hats, not like I was back then
[SPEAKER_01]: where I literally was, and getting out and
engaging with cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the commercial growers in
Colorado were using Cocos.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our first validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say that before that,
the university validation, we tested on
[SPEAKER_01]: several different real soil types,
meaning we brought a bunch of soil back
[SPEAKER_01]: from different environments, at least
local around Colorado, that represented
[SPEAKER_01]: different soil textures, different soil
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with different potting media.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with a lot of different plant
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with a lot of cannabis growers
outside the university.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a pretty good representative data
set that we thought it worked well across
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of different plants and a lot of
different substrates because we felt like
[SPEAKER_01]: these microbes are very robust,
meaning very efficacious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could work in a lot of different
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a targeted function that all
plants needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could just deliver these microbes to
the rhizosphere root zone, they would
[SPEAKER_01]: engage the plant and deliver the function
that they needed and wanted that would
[SPEAKER_01]: help them succeed their development,
yield, and other properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, it's had we've grown,
and we're selling this technology all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousands and thousands and thousands of
growers are using this, and we hear great
[SPEAKER_01]: results across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I hear all the bad news,
if there is bad news out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: quite honestly, but we hear a lot of great
news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've probably seen some good
results, too, over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've known each other for years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting me on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I've been working with the Gold
Leaf Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an interview with Ben Higgins.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's their research scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the trials they recently completed
was with mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found they got about a 12% increase
in wet weight relative to the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they're doing ongoing trials to
replicate that, but the initial results
[SPEAKER_00]: were quite positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a setup that I think is fairly
optimal from a microbial perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about large beds that hold
about a third of a yard of soil per bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That soil is relatively undisturbed for
the entire cycle and has been around for,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're on five years now with the
same soil that they've been amending.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly living entity that they have
for a media compared to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you would actually see less of a
response than that because of the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were doing so much to already
help out the microbial communities in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a fair hypothesis,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's only so much value,
I think microbes will bring in once that's
[SPEAKER_01]: maximized and there is some functional
redundancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really good feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to stay in touch with you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say that most of the growers in
Northern California that we work with are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to engage in some type of living
soil where they're minimizing or trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: minimize the amount of nutrients they're
adding and they're trying to stay as
[SPEAKER_01]: holistic with their environment as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they do add some as needed across
the growing season and particularly in
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're adding microbes and nurturing
microbe life.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are plugging in mammoth pee
and seeing good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting about that also is the
targeted functionality of mammoth microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: in particular where there's a lot of
nitrogen delivering microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty common function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fossus is a little less so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fossus is really tricky to deliver to
plants in those particular substrates
[SPEAKER_01]: because fossus is sticky, chemically,
quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having some microbial catalyst liberate
the phosphorus might be why this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular environment, this grower
facility is seeing that added benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12% is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty good value add.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about such a high value
crop, that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm curious about now is over time,
what sort of persistence are we going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you recommend applications over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious to see if that yield increase
stays the same across multiple cycles or
[SPEAKER_00]: if it starts to, at some point,
level out to where they're consistently
[SPEAKER_00]: getting 12% with these applications over
what their control used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they'll eventually switch
everything over if things continue down
[SPEAKER_00]: that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious how these microbes do
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's been some research on
persistence out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a hard question to answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, I'm kind of winding in and
that's why I gave some background on some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the research I did before starting this
company because I think about that and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think about persistence a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the differences in the work that I
was doing in natural systems that was by
[SPEAKER_01]: definition undisturbed until I went out
there and disturbed some of it with my
[SPEAKER_01]: research to collect data was the
disturbance that's inherent with
[SPEAKER_01]: management systems, with agriculture
management systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what I do know is that microbes
thrive with a living plant root because
[SPEAKER_01]: plants feed microbes and so if you're
delivering the microbes to the rhinosphere
[SPEAKER_01]: as an example of an inoculate,
those microbes are more than likely going
[SPEAKER_01]: to love that environment because it's a
nutrient-rich environment and all those
[SPEAKER_01]: other adapthic properties that we kind of
prefaced earlier in our talk here are
[SPEAKER_01]: right for the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's definitely feeding into food
source and it's going to be a happy home.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens at the end of the growth
season?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, typically, the plant gets chopped,
the exudates quit coming out because the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's not photosensitizing anymore,
it's harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that creates a completely different
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I would say is there's
probably some persistence, but I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know enough to know how much turnover
there's going to be for mammoth microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: in particular, if you want me to just
preface it by that, because you're dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with a very different environment and now
the roots are dead and they're decaying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to nurture more fungal
life because fungi like to break down
[SPEAKER_01]: those very complex root structures that
the bacteria then can follow up and take
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage of and continue to mineralize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a good chance that the
re-inoculation with the new plant cycle is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, we could probably do
some work together to get to the root of
[SPEAKER_01]: this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe through some sampling or whatnot,
do some microbial analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my guess is it's most efficient to add
these inoculants with every new plant
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle because of the effects of a living
plant and the interactions a living plant
[SPEAKER_01]: would have on the microbial community that
the soil without a plant or plant roots
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't have a plant associated with
them anymore that have been cut off,
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the environment selects and it's
a very different environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is going to be some persistence
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to manage because we can't see
that or measure it regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So regular applications, for sure you can
manage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hypothesize, and again,
this is pure speculation on my part,
[SPEAKER_00]: that after this one cycle, for example,
at Gold Leaf where they got a 12% increase
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they go to a re-amend the cycle
and they'll probably do a light till.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then replant, you're going to see some
die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wonder if some of those microbes
that were introduced will persist and stay
[SPEAKER_00]: active to where they may see a 4% increase
in wet weight over the control next time
[SPEAKER_00]: or something, some level of persistence in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wonder if the addition of mammoth
pea in this case of microbes that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: active right back into the rhizosphere
would speed up that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Process because one thing that you know of
all people is that these microbes can
[SPEAKER_00]: survive some very amazing conditions,
environmental conditions, through dormancy
[SPEAKER_00]: or insisting or all these other processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't really want to wait for that
when we're talking about a high value crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're trying to cycle out as fast as
possible too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's where my head's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we think about two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think about the targeted functionality
and how microbes are engaging the other
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've already said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see abundances or density.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some level, the denser microbial
communities or the biomass in general is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to create more function because
there's more microbes to create more
[SPEAKER_01]: function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with those applications, you're going
to get to that higher density quicker
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of having to revive maybe a latent
or a more dormant microbial community that
[SPEAKER_01]: overwintered in a natural example or is
trying to be brought back from last
[SPEAKER_01]: season's crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this particular example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think both of the hypothesis that you
stated are really fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it'd be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be a that'd be a fun study to
conduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's just so much we don't know
about the rhizosphere that I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've kind of touched on so many
things just in this podcast that has
[SPEAKER_00]: brought up a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing a lot of new research
coming out on this idea of microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculants?
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely seems to be taking off in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I think just to be fair,
I think it's the quickest growing
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture industry segment across all
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biggest reason for that is because
nutrients are really hard to deliver in
[SPEAKER_01]: soils and farmers are having a horrible
time managing nutrient absorption and
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake for nitrogen and for phosphorus in
particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium is very difficult in rural
soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in mineral soils as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the industry is taking off because
there's a real need for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of interesting technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's focused on a couple of different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think about effective products?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been a challenge for the
microbial bio-stimulant industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you call it in agriculture,
microbial bio-stimulants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it, you know, beneficial bacteria
in the cannabis industry, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fair across both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty intuitive, you know,
does do the microbial bio-stimulants work?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do the microbes do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they do it consistently?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do they work in many different
environments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the three questions you want to
bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they work consistently and they have a
targeted function, then you can use them
[SPEAKER_01]: with confidence or with precision because
you know what they're doing and they
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great for a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they are efficacious, meaning they
work across a lot of different management
[SPEAKER_01]: or environmental conditions, then they can
work for a lot of farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the three big hurdles I
think any manufacturer wants to overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we acknowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what we overcame with
developing MMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just one of those things where we
went into it from a scientific perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: and we engaged it as scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't engage it as a microbial
manufacturing company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a science experiment, quite
frankly, and a scientific, fundamental
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific endeavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do I think that there are products
out there like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's been some products out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arbusco and mycorrhizae is an example
that's been around forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nitrogen-fixing bacteria that have
been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those technologies will continue to
evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are going to get rebranded
and have been in spaces for a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: and will get rebranded for new markets or
new crops, new industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's other cool
technologies coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, was that a talk?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a little while now where there's
some notion of endophyte.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some crops, it's developing quicker
than others where you can have specific
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial species that will actually
engage intracellularly with plant roots to
[SPEAKER_01]: help facilitate plant health or trigger
specific growth through chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are pretty interesting
technologies because they're super
[SPEAKER_01]: specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trick is if you have an intracellular
or an endoskeleton specific bacteria that
[SPEAKER_01]: works well across one crop, you really
want it to work well across a lot of crops
[SPEAKER_01]: or the crops of interest at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a lot of pretty deep
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of other technologies also
that you think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there's a performance vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want plants to be very healthy and grow
and yield and maximize their quality or
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor or bricks or whatever crop you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cannabinoid and THC is a good
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the cannabis industry, and then there's
this bio control space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the two industry verticals
that I'm pretty fascinated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want performance and then you want
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of products in the
general agriculture space that use
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes to mitigate pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot fight biology with biology,
but it's tricky in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of these technologies are
foliarly applied and with regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: pressures of microbial counts on flour or
on the biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're adding microbes to above ground
applications, and this can happen with
[SPEAKER_01]: some teas also, you might be engineering
microbial counts that you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: engineer for regulatory purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be below a certain CFU.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tricky and our company has
actually steered away from thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial technologies above ground right
now until we figure out how to think about
[SPEAKER_01]: this better with maybe deriving
biochemical solutions through microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: growth that will attack certain pests or
mold or mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have one product that we just
launched in the market that's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial product for that very reason
that I explained, but I got pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: sophisticated and simple at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a targeted oil product for different
insect pest mitigation, and it works good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing any issues with using a
product like mammoth pea or other
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial products in terms of failing
microbial tests with soil applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not asking specific to your
product per se, more just this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that was brought to my attention
recently as some of these new states are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming online in Canada, the restrictions
around microbial testing on flour is
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really tight and doesn't take into
account a lot of the probiotic and
[SPEAKER_00]: prophylactic microbes that exist in these
growing systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think you're putting yourself at
greater risk by using microbial products
[SPEAKER_00]: or using living soils when we're talking
about passing these tests versus a more
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical approach?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think just the opposite,
but I validated it with mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was interested enough to ask that
question and put some resources on our
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I think is honestly, microbes are
very rarely, at least the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to infiltrate the cells and work
their way all the way up intracellularly
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant and then emerge in the above
ground flour tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just such a tall order and we haven't
seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where some of the challenges or
hurdles that endophyte bacteria are right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, that technology that's cool from a
scientific perspective, but very hard
[SPEAKER_01]: because plant, just like our skin cells,
it's a barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to keep out microbes and so
it's actively keeping out microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so keeping microbes in the soil where
soil microbes actually function in their
[SPEAKER_01]: active plants is brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We conducted a study at our farm here in
Colorado where we did a greenhouse and an
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor soil study looking at simple very
simple treated mammoth pea treated and
[SPEAKER_01]: non-treated, keeping everything else the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil applications just like we would with
our technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at CFU counts on the flower
of the outdoor crop and the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in both environments tied,
the CFU bacterial counts, both of them
[SPEAKER_01]: were passing out of all fairness.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the CFU counts on the microbial
mammoth treated plants were significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: lower than the non-treated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wow, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you ask, well, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why I think is because if you can
engage with a healthy writer to share
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome, these plants are actually
creating their own health mechanisms to
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize their health, their development,
and all these other properties,
[SPEAKER_01]: which could limit the occupancy of
different microbes above ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just say it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably not the most suave way of
saying it, but the data was what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of seems counterintuitive to
what you would expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think they come out of the
soil is a short answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the microbes are making it
up in the soil or making it up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: above ground plant colas where they're
actually being tested or the flowers in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're engaging with the plant health
mechanisms to make sure the plant's taking
[SPEAKER_01]: up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a primary function of low
ground soil microbes, nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these nutrients are actually building
blocks that help build molecules that
[SPEAKER_01]: allow the plants to respond to
environments, to stress, to developing
[SPEAKER_01]: quality metrics like terpenes and
cannabinoids also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can naturally maximize plant
nutrient intake, I think the plant can do
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: In nature, this is another example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see plants being devastated by
pests in many cases, or mildew in
[SPEAKER_01]: monocrops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens more so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in nature, why didn't that happen to
everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants persist, and to a large
degree, it's because they have,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in nature, a long-standing,
very, very healthy soil microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere interaction that allows them
to take what they need to survive in their
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my thought was more along the line
of soils than microbial inoculants,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the idea that having a soil in your
room, things might get disturbed through
[SPEAKER_00]: employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that dust may contain bacteria
that may make its way up onto the colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that may slightly raise your CFU
count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like if people that are trying to go
vertical with soils, I think that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're physically applying,
got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're physically applying soil to any
above-ground material, there's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: markers on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in Vegas a couple of years ago
touring a facility that wanted to grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses, and they had it shut the
greenhouse down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason was because it's the desert
out there in Nevada, and they couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: keep enough dust out from blowing over
their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were failing microbial tests
because the dust from the outside that
[SPEAKER_01]: they couldn't keep out of the greenhouse
was blowing over their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was nothing wrong with this
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this natural soil dust,
if you will, airborne soil that are
[SPEAKER_01]: basically harboring soil microbes because
that's where microbes live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you do want to keep the soil off of
the above-ground because, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could be inoculating your above-ground
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's wet, it's not going to fly
around as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it stays in the pot, if it's in trays,
I think you can manage that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you definitely want to take measures
to manage that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think the laws are kind of
ludicrous right now around microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington's gotten a little bit better in
the sense that now it tests for more
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strains or diseases, which would
impact human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the testing's itself is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that just like any other crop,
we should be able to rinse or wash it or
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it in a way that contains probiotic
bacteria and it's not dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the regulations being what they are,
we have to work within them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I shouldn't say this when I say it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard educating regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what a daunting task.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, and this is what you were
talking about a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking at very, very core CFU,
colony forming unit concentrations of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not looking at what microbes are
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are two completely different
hazard issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's very, very, very few.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most microbes on Earth,
99.999% of all microbes on Earth are
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shame that all we hear about are
most of the bad ones, partially because we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know a lot about the good ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humans have to focus on the bad ones
because they are more of our risk,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so categorizing all the good microbes
with some very, very few bad players,
[SPEAKER_01]: just inherently nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how they evolved, is not
honestly scientifically accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brought up a question for me I've
been wanting to ask you, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: how globally, how much diversity do we
really see in the microbial world as we
[SPEAKER_00]: move from Arizona to Colorado to Ethiopia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to see the same microbes more
or less, but probably in different ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: or in different functional groups?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I hear a lot of talk about using
indigenous microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are culturing or
promoting what is already successful in
[SPEAKER_00]: their area.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are there any dangers with bringing
in these outside microbes into a new
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to just kind of touch on this
subject a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, it's a conceptual
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, you hear about,
as a microbiologist, one of the terms that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes up often is ubiquity, especially
environmental microbiologists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is everywhere in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you are going to see,
in most cases, that's more or less true,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's going to be vast differences
in their relative abundances of certain
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial groups and microbial functional
groups in some environments relative to
[SPEAKER_01]: others because, again, the environment
selects and favors some over the other
[SPEAKER_01]: based on some of the conversations we had
earlier in this talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, in some cases, for sure,
in extreme environments, for sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to see very unique species
that just can't persist other places
[SPEAKER_01]: because that environment is not going to
nurture the vast majority of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen, I've actually experienced
companies and worked with companies who
[SPEAKER_01]: are manufacturing, microbial manufacturing
companies, and they're trying to get their
[SPEAKER_01]: product over to Australia, as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Australia, the regulators in Australia
were like, whoa, we don't want these
[SPEAKER_01]: invasive microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I guess I don't blame them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The word invasive is pretty tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want these invasive microbes in
our country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how this particular company got around
that is they proved that the microbes in
[SPEAKER_01]: this particular product they were making
were in their country already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think everything, more than not,
is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how it's packaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the relative abundances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some real variability in how
different microbes at different relative
[SPEAKER_01]: abundances can be packaged to perform
different functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've realized that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's this whole other level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scale is my favorite word ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's this whole other level of
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do we even know what a species
is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'll tell you right now,
you know, there's numerous species of E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to give this extreme
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very few of them are even bad for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only hear about the bad ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use that example because everyone's
like, whoa, E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli will kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to work with E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain strains of E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, the genus and species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be distinct, but that's
not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a cultivar in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many varieties within a
cultivar that have different traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, microbes have the same kind of
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a strain specificity that shifts
more so than species specificity around
[SPEAKER_01]: different regions, around our geography of
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's harder to measure that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's this other level that as
microbial ecologists or the industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: general, the area of environmental
microbiology is changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just now starting to wrap its head
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we measure this with confidence
within any one species?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an ongoing challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot to add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gives me a lot to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other question or something I did want
to bring up that I thought was interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: from hearing one of your talks,
though, was that when you talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've used the word consortia quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we talk about these microbes
as being generalists or very targeted,
[SPEAKER_00]: you did some research that found that any
one bacteria in mammoth pea by itself did
[SPEAKER_00]: not have the same effect as all of them
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sum is more than the parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just touch on that really quickly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was kind of touching on that in my
last little rant there, where there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: real magic in the interactions of microbes
in those relative abundancees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no single species that act in
nature alone because microbes have evolved
[SPEAKER_01]: to interact not only with other plants and
other biotic counterparts, but with other
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial species in particular at the
very beginning of the creation of life,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we realized, knowing that what
we knew as microbial ecologists from our
[SPEAKER_01]: academic training, was that we needed to
create a consortia of microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, again, almost the same word for
a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's assembly of different species that
come together to interact to perform a
[SPEAKER_01]: unique function or have interactive
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was our goal the whole time,
to create consortia of microbes in any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of product that we were going to
deploy for agriculture, because we felt
[SPEAKER_01]: like they would be more efficacious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that they would have a higher
functionality because it mimicked a
[SPEAKER_01]: natural system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as an example, if we had a highly
functional stable consortia and we entered
[SPEAKER_01]: them or we added them to any one soil,
they would have a lot higher chance of
[SPEAKER_01]: persisting and engaging with the existing
community in the soil and plants in that
[SPEAKER_01]: environment than a single species,
which would be very much out of its
[SPEAKER_01]: element and probably have a lot more
competitive pressures for food and
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise with the not only endemic
microbes with the other biotic life in
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we tested the theory or the
hypothesis by not only testing the
[SPEAKER_01]: consortia and nurturing this consortia
that we have at MAMSP, but then we broke
[SPEAKER_01]: down the individual species within this
formula and tested their functionality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we combined all two, threes,
and four combinations to realize that in
[SPEAKER_01]: this formula, and at that concentration,
we had optimal functionality, which
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't be achieved by any of the lesser
counterparts, meaning the one or two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three species combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really fascinating stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to touch on some of the,
one of the topics we had put on here was
[SPEAKER_00]: the myths of cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the beliefs growers have held
over time around certain growing practices
[SPEAKER_00]: and are they legitimate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately though, we're out of time
for today, but I would love to maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: follow up with you another time down the
road, if that would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a whole session on
myths.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably know a couple of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few ideas, but I would love to
hear what you have to say with your
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we sign off, I want to put you
on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you maybe give listeners one
actionable thing that they could do in
[SPEAKER_00]: their gardens to promote microbial health?
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides using mammoth pee, what else can
you recommend growers consider just as a
[SPEAKER_00]: good practice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what I'll say.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just remember that carbon is the currency
of all life on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what distinguishes healthy soils
and high cation exchange from lower cation
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange are not so fertile soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what distinguishes natural systems
from agriculture systems that were heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: farmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's soil organic matter or carbon content
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can nurture and maximize your
carbon content at some level, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to nurture the soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to nurture the soil health
not only in the ability of the soil to
[SPEAKER_01]: hold on to nutrients, but you're going to
harbor the microbial life that can help
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: The carbon is the key for all of us on
earth and it's no different for the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate your time today,
Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to talking to you again
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just recorded a podcast comprised of
listener questions and it was a lot of fun
[SPEAKER_00]: being on the other side of the microphone
and John did an excellent job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to share it with you here
shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to the cannabis
cultivation and science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
Thanks for listening.
