[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_02]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now before starting the podcast,
I want to remind folks that we do have a
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon for growers who want access to the
raw podcast weeks earlier as well as extra
[SPEAKER_02]: content that we don't share publicly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also recently published a review of the
BioSaluna LED light on our YouTube channel
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can check out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're in the market for LEDs for
your facility or have questions about
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting, please do reach out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest this week is Christine De Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christine operates at the intersection of
regenerative organic agriculture and
[SPEAKER_02]: social justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: For five years, she's been perfecting a
highly efficient organic cultivation model
[SPEAKER_02]: while managing operations for Galenis
cannabis in Akron, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior, she worked in Food Justice,
ran a farm for Great Lakes Brewing
[SPEAKER_02]: Company, functioned as a campaign
coordinator for Marijuana Policy Project,
[SPEAKER_02]: and co-founded the Midwest Canna Women.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was featured in the documentary
Polycultures, Food Where We Live with
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael Pollan and at the My Global
Kitchen exhibit at the Cleveland Museum of
[SPEAKER_02]: Natural History.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christine is a creative writer,
a columnist for Cannabis Business Times
[SPEAKER_02]: Magazine and holds degrees from both Kent
State and the University of Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_02]: In her current role, she focuses on
keeping plants, processes, and people
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy and productive while delivering
top tier quality cannabis flower to Ohio
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christine also works with home growers to
bring commercial level success to their
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Christine, thanks for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, why don't we start off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me a little bit about yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've spent the last six years with
Galenis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an indoor living soil certified kind
or certified organic grow in Akron,
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to that, I worked in vegetable
farming for Great Lakes Brewing Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: spent 13 years in the field growing 30 or
40 different crops and just learning how
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow vegetables, hops, pumpkins for the
pumpkin ale, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also worked in policy quite a bit,
worked for Marijuana Policy Project,
[SPEAKER_00]: created a network of signature gatherers
for various campaigns to legalize medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, did some lobbying, lobbied in D
.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: and spent some time really just kind of
building networks of activists to help
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially legalize medical marijuana in
Ohio, which now led to our adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three children, three wonderful
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even have my first grandchild now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've spent a long time raising kids and
growing healthy foods for all of them to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat as well and been involved with food
policy and food access in neighborhoods
[SPEAKER_00]: where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you, so prior to getting
into Galenis, had you grown cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it sounds like your background is
really in vegetable production.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So primarily I focused on vegetable
production and really that ties back into
[SPEAKER_00]: raising children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did grow cannabis when I was very
young.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was part of the marijuana
culture, I would say, from a teenager on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when my children were born,
I decided it wasn't worth the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, Ohio has been a prohibition
state for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me personally, the two just
couldn't work together, couldn't coexist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took my energy of wanting to grow
cannabis and put it in a vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: production until legalization passed and
then was able to finally dive full in
[SPEAKER_00]: legal cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so you had some familiarity with the
plant and some of the differences between
[SPEAKER_02]: that and say, you know, some of these
vegetable crops like like pumpkins and and
[SPEAKER_02]: you mentioned hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that experience, you know,
coming from agriculture help you when you
[SPEAKER_02]: move to I mean, you're moving from outdoor
production to it sounds like to controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: environment agriculture indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that process help you and what
things were?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you kind of have to get the speed on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it definitely prepared me quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It growing so many different vegetables to
like in a more polyculture farm setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just learned the essentials of
what plants crave, what they need to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was pretty well versed on growing
everything from like spring crops and coal
[SPEAKER_00]: crops to tomatoes, hops, which are totally
different perennials, fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just became sort of well versed in
plants overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was concerned for sure when I moved
into indoor agriculture and just because I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't essentially grow cannabis myself at
home during those years while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing vegetables, I definitely assisted
some other people in growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had close friends, of course,
that were growers and spent quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: time learning from them and kind of
preparing myself for when I would be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But moving into indoor production,
my biggest concern when I moved from
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors indoors really was, can I do the
same things that I'm doing outside inside
[SPEAKER_00]: without running the risk of failing crops
for microbials?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was honestly my biggest risk
because I've always grown organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always had like the soil food web
sort of production model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was definitely very concerned that I
would have problems failing for beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, essentially, or fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that fear led me to be more
restrictive over what things I use indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: until I started passing some tests and
making sure that I was going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of use the same systems that I had
used outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, it was a big adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some things I found are a lot
easier like, of course, you're not dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the weather and the rain and you're
able to control the climate and that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some things have been a little more
challenging, like just like using soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: managing the dusts really is a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're transplanting, when you're
moving soil throughout a building,
[SPEAKER_00]: being very cautious as to where those
dusts are going and doing a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitation, of course, to stay on top of
the residues and dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And buildups that you can get from using
soil in an indoor operation have been a
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge, but we've been very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 95% pass rate over the past six
years, which I think is very good for
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have the benefit of having
like a really nice turf profile yields and
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of an overall very high quality
that we've established, which I think a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of that is attributed to the
compost-based mediums and different
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques that we're using indoors that
our competitors essentially aren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you have the added challenge of Ohio
regulations to where you had to build
[SPEAKER_02]: vertically, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because of the way the laws are
structured.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about that a little bit and
describe what your facility looks like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Ohio has a different regulations
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not limited by plant count or
regulated by plant count, and they're also
[SPEAKER_00]: not regulated by canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Size, but rather by regulated room
footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently there was two tiers of
medical cultivation size.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was 25,000 square foot of indoor
regulated room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other was 3000 square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in the smaller grow, which was the
3000 square foot, but the ownership group
[SPEAKER_00]: of the company decided to essentially
exploit that legally, compliantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: By building vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I think Flora and Flame,
which was a guest previously on your show,
[SPEAKER_00]: the head cultivator there, spoke about
their grow being modeled after the Grove
[SPEAKER_00]: in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Galenis, where I work, was also modeled
after that grow, which I think is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a common theme for this being a new style
of producing cannabis indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was built, designed to have
three growing tiers in each of the two
[SPEAKER_00]: flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two flower rooms are both 1500
square foot, but have three tiers of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation across the, you know,
vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're essentially growing on all
those three tiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really operating at essentially
9,000 square foot of growing space,
[SPEAKER_00]: but only 3000 square foot of room
footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tell me a little bit about your
cultivation method.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are in containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have pushed back on this idea
of living soils, being in containers,
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, you know, if you're truly living
soil, you're reusing the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're in beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get quite as caught up in the,
those semantics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm fine with you using the term living
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as long as you're focused on
cultivating with biology in mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: with that concept of nutrient cycling
coming from the microbes in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that soil is alive and it's living
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what size containers are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that process sort of look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the living soil thing is
definitely a term that I had never used
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to coming into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a compost based medium or compost
based potting soil is probably the more
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil and what exactly that implies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's defined by pot size
or exactly the parameter is around
[SPEAKER_00]: officially using that term, but it's
definitely something very commonly used in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess I've adopted it a bit,
but we're currently growing in 10 and 15
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started the facility was
using five gallon fabric pots and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were running 2000 plants per room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've since over the course of five years,
reduced the number of plants down to 744
[SPEAKER_00]: per room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a substantial reduction in plant
count.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are definitely trends
that point or data that points to more of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sea of green and having a larger
population of plants that are much smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: in size can achieve higher yields in
certain systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's definitely a
place for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's potentially a way to achieve
greater yields in certain systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our building was designed essentially
for larger plants because the tiers are
[SPEAKER_00]: seven feet apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they didn't have gutters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were not designed for like an
automated watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my strategy was to reduce the touch
points essentially that people are having
[SPEAKER_00]: to do because labor being one of our
greatest costs, it made the most sense to
[SPEAKER_00]: when you have to take all of your plants
and put them on a scissor lift and lift
[SPEAKER_00]: them up 10 and 20 plus feet into the air
and then set them on a bench and repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: that cycle every 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made more sense for us to be using less
plants per bench, but in a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage to that also is that it is a
bigger pot and there's more soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant biology, I'm sorry,
the soil biology can stay alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: More easily, it's more stable because it's
in this larger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use 15 gallon pots on the bottom
tier and then we use 10 gallon pots on the
[SPEAKER_00]: second and third tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen a slightly larger increase
in yield per plant in the 15 gallon over
[SPEAKER_00]: the 10 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does depend on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen some cultivars that actually
produce slightly higher at 10 gallons,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the majority of them produce roughly
5% higher yield in the 15 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the 10 gallon, but in both size pots,
we're able to really keep the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology very stable and also have the
watering cycle that is the most efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: for our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was also, as most of the decisions
I've made in the facility, very team
[SPEAKER_00]: driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I go to the cultivation
technicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what would you rather do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lift 20 plants, 20 pots that are lighter
onto a bench or 10 pots that are heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consensus was always 10 pots that
are heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to load a room in essentially
12 hours and we're able to offload a room
[SPEAKER_00]: in four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been the most efficient method
we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also like the stability of the soil
and all of the other things that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: have less touch points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when we take moisture readings,
for example, like we use a moisture reader
[SPEAKER_00]: to detect and determine how much water we
should water in that the next watering,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can take a smaller sampling and still
get a good look at where each cultivar is
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as moisture levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing I would think would be more
apparent would be any sort of nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency or issue that you may have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would expect to see it in the 10 gallon
pot sooner than the 15 across the same
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the biggest advantage I've seen to
more soil is just sort of that buffering
[SPEAKER_02]: effect in terms of deficiency or nutrient
uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your experience with that,
though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do see the deficiencies that do pop
up more quickly in the 10 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do sometimes actually see higher
potency in the 10 gallons over the 15
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that's directly related
because, of course, if you have an excess
[SPEAKER_00]: of nitrogen, from my experience,
I've always seen that plants if we feed a
[SPEAKER_00]: little too much nitrogen in or if the soil
had a little too much nitrogen to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: with that we see a drop in potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do believe that's like in a fairly
well established inverse relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do see more deficiency earlier in
the tens, but they do also have different
[SPEAKER_00]: drybacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I think attributes sometimes to
or generally to uptake, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the plant stays a little bit too
dry, for too long, then that deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: could essentially be a dry back issue
versus a soil fertility issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would think maybe in the 10
gallons, in addition to nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: just the plant stress, unintentional plant
stress through maybe osmotic pressure on
[SPEAKER_02]: the roots or something related to your
watering or a lack of nutrients to the
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller pot that may lead to higher
translate to higher cannabinoid levels,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you were saying, typically at the
expense of yields, I would say,
[SPEAKER_02]: could be the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, I think that's an
interesting comparison between 10 and 15
[SPEAKER_02]: or let's just say a larger versus smaller
container size with what we're calling
[SPEAKER_02]: living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that ultimately,
as we expand and we move into four flower
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms or six flower rooms, we'll probably
go to a 10 gallon only just to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: everything completely the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because obviously, the more differences
you have in your system, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: accommodations you have to make in your
schedules and into the attention that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're giving the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would probably move to 10 gallons
for the whole operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's a pretty happy medium,
a 10 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to a 10 gallon, I was using a six
and a half gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely saw more issues with
deficiency than now I see in a 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 10 is more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four by eight benches and 10 tens
on that four by eight bench works pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: well with the canopy filling out without
having any which without having the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously too crowded and enough room to
work so that you can access all sides of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants and have the right airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not going water only throughout
the growth cycle in that 10 though either?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we definitely start with a pretty
heavily fortified soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 25, roughly 25% compost based as a
soil that I've worked with a local soil
[SPEAKER_00]: maker to be used specifically for cannabis
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a process that probably took us
a full two years to fully develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of started with their base soil
and added some more fertility,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more aeration, and got it to
where we wanted with the dry back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just like focus a little bit more
on individual nutrients and making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had exactly what we wanted with
the fertility levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was based really on tissue
testing, mid cycle, late cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: testing spent soil at the end and seeing
what was left and what we started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we, as I mentioned, we worked
with that soil maker to really develop it
[SPEAKER_00]: how we wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I decided basically
that one top dress per cycle with a
[SPEAKER_00]: granular, I use a granular chicken manure
based fertilizer that's also made here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one top dress at week two was about
the right amount of additional fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had it to add in a dry form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we also take that same fertilizer
and weekly from week two through week
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, I take that same granular
fertilizer, I mix it in a brute container,
[SPEAKER_00]: 44 gallon brute container, and put it on a
bubbler overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do maybe eight of those brutes per
room, bubble it overnight, which really
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially is just breaking it down and
probably doing some level of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we give each plant a liter of
that liquid once per week from week two
[SPEAKER_00]: through week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's essentially all the additional
nutrient that we water into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tried, I've done quite a few
different little R&D trials with just
[SPEAKER_00]: loading all of that nutrient in on the
front end into the soil and definitely not
[SPEAKER_00]: had nearly the same results as when we
sort of spoon feed it on a weekly basis in
[SPEAKER_00]: this partially decomposed way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do also push a lot of worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the worm castings are also made into a
liquid, not a tea exactly, but just an
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in veg, I like to really feed in a
lot of worm casting extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do taper that off at the
beginning of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also do a little bit of foliar
feeding with a couple different products
[SPEAKER_00]: that I like for just kind of the beginning
of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those foliar feeds, which are
essentially just like a soy protein
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolysate and a potassium product that I
like quite a bit, I use those also,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, certified organic products in
veg through week one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's the only other nutrient
that the plants get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's more front loading it in
the vegetative cycle to like build that
[SPEAKER_00]: structure that we're looking for in the
flower finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you brought up some good points in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the first one I want to highlight
is this idea that if you are in a
[SPEAKER_02]: container, and I look at a 10 gallon
container as sort of a smaller size,
[SPEAKER_02]: relatively speaking, for growing in what
we call on living soil here, you will
[SPEAKER_02]: probably get much better results.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may be able to make it through a whole
cycle, water only, depending on lighting,
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 levels, those sorts of other limiting
factors, higher watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can add fertility slowly
throughout that cycle, I would absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: expect to get better results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a really good point to
highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to touch on that before I?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I would just say that in the side by
sides that we've done of putting that
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient, the equal amount of nutrient in
the front end, I mean, the yield was
[SPEAKER_00]: almost half of what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we add it in little bits throughout
the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty dramatic difference that
I've seen from doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you watering to run off as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are essentially watering to run off,
but there's very little runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I like we have a saucer underneath
each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no like run to waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever does run off is recaptured and
reused by the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And going back to your formulation of a
soil, you said it took about two years,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think that's really interesting
because that's the number that I throw out
[SPEAKER_02]: to people when I say what it should take
to formulate the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like we had a similar
process, a thought process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you start with like what I would call a
base mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, that's something usually around
peat moss, pumice and a compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we add fertility to that,
and then we test and just turn one dial at
[SPEAKER_02]: a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once we get it kind of where we want
it, then we start running plant trials and
[SPEAKER_02]: then further refine the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just takes a long time.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you want to add to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I would just say it takes a lot of
time and takes a lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And R&D in general is really difficult in
a production facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, looking back, you know,
like if I could redesign the facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're in, I would definitely build
out a small R&D room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think if you have your own R&D
room and you can trial things on like a 10
[SPEAKER_00]: or 20 plant basis and take that testing,
you could really move things forward a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly than you can when every
square foot counts in your production
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your production facility,
your hands are kind of tied in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can only play around with so many
things per cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, that's generally maybe 10 plants,
10 to 20 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would much rather be able to do that
outside of the production space and be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to just have side by sides running
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the other issue with R&D is just
really, especially now when we have a team
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just so dialed in, is just,
you know, oh, you can only do this for
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do this differently for this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just hard to stay as
efficient, of course, with your task
[SPEAKER_00]: delegation when you have R&D going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our team's been really creative in
figuring out how to make little signs and
[SPEAKER_00]: markers and tags and things like that for
plants that are supposed to get some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of special instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been able to collect much
better data now that we have like this
[SPEAKER_00]: team that's really well established and
knows what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it definitely can be done, but it's
always challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger part of it too is the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so like the extra expense of
testing 10 plants specifically and now
[SPEAKER_00]: what are we doing with that small batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it going to be sold?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if the test results are different and
we don't want to release it onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: market?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then that small batch has to
essentially be frozen or used for a
[SPEAKER_00]: different purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it has challenges all the way
down the cycle that make it just take more
[SPEAKER_00]: time and cost more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is difficult, but we've definitely
been able to do a fair share of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that as long as you're really
being diligent about capturing the data,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the most important part,
because it's easy to start the experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's harder to see it all the way
through and then analyze the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's really cultivar
dependent, you know, so that makes a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the soil process, yeah,
I would say that took us a solid two years
[SPEAKER_00]: and we still, it's ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's times when a supply
input may change and say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to shift to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we have to kind of start the
process again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in certain situations, we realize that
something is occurring that we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve against slightly upon,
whether it's usually like porosity,
[SPEAKER_00]: drainage, dryback, things like that,
more so than nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel pretty locked in on our
nutrient levels at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because we get such consistent high
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also just get the yields that are
achieving our goals all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's always a question in the back
of your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what if we tried a little bit more
of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's an ongoing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it should always continue
because the research and development is
[SPEAKER_00]: what, you can't break the barrier until
you've tried something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk about these inputs,
you know, fertilizers, compost,
[SPEAKER_02]: castings, all of these things,
like they're consistent and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: homogenous and in the real world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They aren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that does require testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you're paying for when you
buy commercial soil, is that the company
[SPEAKER_02]: has done that testing for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to ask for testing results,
I think is a very reasonable request and
[SPEAKER_02]: expectation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then understanding how to interpret
those results, because I've seen tests
[SPEAKER_02]: that have been put out publicly by various
companies that highlight issues in my
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, yet they're being promoted as
a good test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think understanding how to read a
test is a really important skill.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more so, it's also not just the
batch testing that you're seeing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but even, and I found this with some of
the other soil manufacturers that I worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with previously, is that the quality
control of the product, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so like you might get the batch testing
every year, but your soil might come in in
[SPEAKER_00]: a different state than it had other times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had problems just like with
vegetable production, because I always
[SPEAKER_00]: started all my plants in a greenhouse from
seed every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking about like 10,000 plants,
where some years the soil just wasn't of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same quality, whether it was too hot
or it, you know, had a different moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: was able to hold moisture differently,
that the quality control from batch to
[SPEAKER_00]: batch is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worry sometimes, because I'm working
with a very small soil provider,
[SPEAKER_00]: that as these companies grow and get
really big and start supplying soil to all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the country, can they maintain that
same level of quality control?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the other thing I want to touch on
was you were talking about figuring out
[SPEAKER_02]: whether the soil got you for drybacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially what you were highlighting
is, what are the physical properties of
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have the right levels of porosity
and gas exchange and water retention that
[SPEAKER_02]: I want?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, you started looking
at fertility, which is sort of the
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical analysis, but we would get back
from on a soil test report, looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of, you know, calcium, magnesium,
potassium, nitrogen, all of these things,
[SPEAKER_02]: and balancing those second.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's really important
because there's sort of really I look at
[SPEAKER_02]: it like a triangle where we have when we
talk about soils, we're looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical, physical and biological
properties of soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are really the that's how I like
to approach I guess, soil mixing or soil
[SPEAKER_02]: formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a complex product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not very simple and
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when we started,
the soils that I first was trialing were
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially just too heavy for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I needed to lighten them up more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work to, you know, like add some
different essentially like more perlite
[SPEAKER_00]: and different things that could open up
the porosity of the soil a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more, because I really think that dry back
that you're looking for is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't get and I know I've
already said this, but if you can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: the watering and the dry back right,
then you just really start to see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think oftentimes, growers are
focused more on the nutrient issues than
[SPEAKER_00]: they are just simply on the water holding
capacity of the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say dry back, you're saying
the soil was staying too wet for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you weren't able to get any gas
exchange around the root system.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the structure of the soil being,
you know, really important, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: because also, how does it compact over
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how quickly does it compact and
close out that those those pores?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how does it retain that that that
porosity?
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you say dry back, how dry are you
letting the soil really get?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we are we talking about bone dry
or are we talking about just a lower,
[SPEAKER_02]: lower moisture level that allows you to re
re water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so what I so I use like our
cultivation technicians are using the the
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Lab pulse moisture meter,
which I like a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, it pairs with their
phone pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go through and just like stick a
lot of pots and get a general range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as that's calibrated with the
medium that you're using, I look for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants being around 30 percent when I want
to water again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can the plants get to that 30 percent
in the time that fits into our schedule to
[SPEAKER_00]: re water?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so like we we only actually
water our plants two times per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we water our plants on Mondays and we
water our plants on Fridays.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Wednesdays is when we apply a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, that's usually either
just a vermicompost extract or that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbled granular fertilizer, which is like
a nutrient tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those on Wednesdays, they'll get a
liter of tea, which is really pretty small
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on Mondays and Fridays, I'd like the
plants to be able to take a full gallon on
[SPEAKER_00]: both days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the plants can take that full
gallon, then I'm getting the dry back that
[SPEAKER_00]: I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want them to reach that 30 percent or
slightly less, but not over before they
[SPEAKER_00]: get that full gallon again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the plants get through flower
and they're they're really metabolizing
[SPEAKER_00]: really high in like week four through
eight, let's say, then we do an additional
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do the moisture readings before each
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we do an additional moisture
reading on Wednesdays and the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: now are drying back too fast as they're
really metabolizing hard and building a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of flower, then they'll get a midweek
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's usually very cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the majority of the plants are getting
watered one gallon on Mondays,
[SPEAKER_00]: one gallon on Fridays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as we get into that really heavy
bulking phase, then plants will get a half
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon, sometimes even a gallon,
depending on the cultivar midweek.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's usually only for about three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we taper that off again.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first off that Blue Lab Pulse Meter,
I did a full review of it on YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: channel for people that are listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got some really cool features in
terms of how it connects with your phone
[SPEAKER_02]: and allows you to even snap photos or
write notes about in relation to that
[SPEAKER_02]: reading that you're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get soil temperature and you get
moisture, which is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I believe I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also get EC, although we don't we
don't really use that component of it
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do get EC too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that can be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do need to correlate it with the
moisture level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are there is a relationship there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have found in a couple of places
that we visited when I bring that in and
[SPEAKER_02]: we go to test the soil, we found either
where we have issues, extremely high or
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely low EC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that allows us to figure it out really
quickly as nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sounds like you have a pretty
dialed in program for what you guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: doing with consistency to where you
wouldn't see huge swings and EC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're able to use the pulse meter to
measure your readings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you water, you're able to
water just twice a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I assume this is because the plants
are still establishing roots filling out
[SPEAKER_02]: the container.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not necessarily needing as much
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you said you then add because my
first thought was like, you only water on
[SPEAKER_02]: set days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in my experience, plants will need
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't correlate necessarily with the
work week as nicely as we would like it
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're able to do that by adding
another supplementing watering as the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots fill out the pot, the plant starts
growing more further in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're adding a third watering,
it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing is by using the
moisture readers, we determine how much
[SPEAKER_00]: water the plants get on Mondays and
Fridays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might not always be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a plant isn't drying back,
if one cultivar isn't drying back as fast
[SPEAKER_00]: as another, that plant may only get a half
gallon on Mondays and a gallon on Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using the readings to help guide
us into how much water each cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: should get at that watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to get to that gallon point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when they're getting the
gallon twice a week, that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolizing the way that I want them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really, you know, when you have a
plant that's six feet tall and a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar that only gets two feet tall and
is real bushy or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just not going to dry back at the
same at the same rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the moisture readings guide us as well
with how much water they get per watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not perfect, of course,
because we're not sampling every single
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 744 plants in a room, we're not
taking a reading off every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're taking enough of a sample size
per cultivar to be able to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, this strain seems like it's drying
back slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reading every morning at 50% or 60%
on Mondays versus the rest reading at 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut that down to a half a
gallon on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is adjusted more so than just by the
day, but by the amount as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are you getting that half gallon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a matter of counting when you're
using a spray wand or are you littering a
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon into another container and then
watering?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using just like a flow meter gallon
counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what you call it,
but just that little gadget that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just hooking on to the end of the hose in
between the watering wand and the hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just measuring the flow that's
going past that device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're an inexpensive little
piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of cycle through quite a few
of them because you'll use them for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of months or maybe six or eight
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a technician will say, I don't think
this one's reading quite the same because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're used to the rhythm of how long a
gallon takes to deliver to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like it's off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we replace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but I'd say they're pretty
effective overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, all the technicians just use a
hose watering wand with the gallon counter
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we determine how many gallons or half
gallon, three quarters of a gallon,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever we want to give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're just watching the meter
and going to the next plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're talking about water,
what is your water source?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the facility was built out with RO
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're expanding into another facility,
I think we're going to move to city water
[SPEAKER_00]: that's filtered versus using reverse
osmosis in the new facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a bit of overkill and it also
is pretty wasteful and it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: align with the company's mission,
but it works fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've always, I think there's a lot
of discussion over whether reverse osmosis
[SPEAKER_00]: water can negatively impact good soil and
soil microbial life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I've thought quite a
lot about over the past few years or five
[SPEAKER_00]: or six years is would it be better to not
be using reverse osmosis water?
[SPEAKER_00]: But since our plants don't run off at all,
I feel like the fact that if it is like
[SPEAKER_00]: over-solubilizing nutrients and it's like
corrosiveness essentially, and washing
[SPEAKER_00]: some nutrients out of the soil,
they're able to kind of go back in because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in a saucer and so it's all
contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were running the waste, if we were
running a lot of water out the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pots, I think it would probably flush
nutrients too quickly, but that's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: case with our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then considering that we do add we do
use it with our teas, at least we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: know where it's at and we know what we're
adding and we know that we're not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: any like antagonism from maybe the calcium
and magnesium that's in the tap water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are you running for PPFD at
Canopy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I run up to around 500, I'm sorry,
I start off at around 400 to 500 in veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: finish around 700 PPFD in veg,
and then run from 700 and top out around a
[SPEAKER_00]: max of 1100 in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm usually hitting right around 1050.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find like that's kind of the sweet
spot for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the lights that we're using at
144, fluent spiders in each room,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they're reaching the end of their
life here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am experimenting with some other
fixtures to see if there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of an advantage to trying something
new, but right around 1050 seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: where I don't start to see light burn or,
you know, plant stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get above that, which I have
experimented higher than that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't really seen a benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know a lot of people run
substantially higher than that and say
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're going to get higher yield,
but I usually just see too much plant
[SPEAKER_00]: stress above that, that it just doesn't
equate to higher yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know you have to obviously feed in
higher and, you know, the plants have to
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolize higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need more CO2 at higher
temperature, all those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is sort of hard to push in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my experience, it's not like
hydroponics, obviously, where you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: dialing in a certain feed level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I think we're pushing the
plants kind of as hard as we can nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to be the right point to
get us the yields and the quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are always a balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I know a lot of people push
really high yields, but those people,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I see their systems, I feel like
oftentimes it's at the expense of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's always, you're always trying
to find this sweet spot of quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: yield that usually hits it for me around
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are the CO2 levels that you're
running in the rooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in veg, I run around 800 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in flower, I go from that 800
PPMs up to about 1400 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just adjusting up by the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried some rooms of dropping the CO2
levels down in the last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think it's sort of questionable
whether or not it's just a waste of CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are really using it when you
start to drop temperature and you start to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold back on water and the plant
metabolism starts slowing down,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it really necessary to run that high to
the exact finish?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's been a lot of
discussion about that and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: disagreement about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do usually step down CO2 in the last
two weeks, but not back down to like 600,
[SPEAKER_00]: like some people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll usually finish around a thousand
PPMs CO2 in a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's pretty high.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1400 is high, I mean, in my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would speculate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think there's a ton of
research on this, at least that I've seen,
[SPEAKER_02]: that stepping it down in the final weeks
would be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're just not utilizing it with the
amount of light and metabolism that's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in the plant towards the very
end of its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming you have a plant that wants to
finish around the time that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know in commercial facilities,
you don't have the luxury of running a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant an extra two, three weeks to hit its
base.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe optimal cannabinoid or terpene
levels just because you're on a schedule.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that CO2 is kind of an elusive
one because it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like with any R&D, it's hard to
isolate one control, especially in a big
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we're in a room that's half of
our total production area, if I was to
[SPEAKER_00]: drop it to 600 PPMs in the last two weeks
and I saw 10% reduction in yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really difficult again to
experiment in these large flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also, there's just so many
variables, of course, every cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't really experimented a whole
lot with CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have changed more over my years in
the same system of production is humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that's probably the biggest
thing that's changed from where I started
[SPEAKER_00]: as to where I am right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, I've always ran a similar
temperature in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like in the peak metabolism phase of
flower, I'm running like around 80
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do definitely drop that down pretty
substantially in the last two weeks to get
[SPEAKER_00]: like the color and the finish and the
terpene profile that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that cooling it down and just
sort of preserving the terpenes at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: and not cooking things off is pretty
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have played around more with the
differential between day and night
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning, I was only running at a
five degree differential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've pushed that much farther apart
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have seen, again, it's hard to
attribute it to just one specific thing
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're making a lot of changes
each cycle sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially in cultivar, like we run
eight to 12 cultivars a cycle and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: always different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to really truly say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel as though bringing that
differential farther apart and trying even
[SPEAKER_00]: to achieve definitely a 10 degree spread,
but even up to a 15 degree spread in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last two weeks can really push yield and
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel as though I've seen that quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've definitely read some studies and
I try and dig into research all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's so exciting, obviously,
now all the new research that's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen some research that suggested
that a 70 degree night temperature and an
[SPEAKER_00]: 81 degree day temperature was optimal for
yield uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen that in certain cannabis
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel pretty similar to that spread
being probably the most effective of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different ones that I've tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as humidity, that's something
that I've really raised over my time in
[SPEAKER_00]: production here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was, it was primarily
fear driven at first, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like running a room at 72% humidity
and flour just went against everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that I knew about managing disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was very nervous to ever run
those higher humidities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I run that 72 to 74% humidity,
definitely through the veg cycle into week
[SPEAKER_00]: one and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I step it down, I step it
down much more gradually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really running in the 68 to 70%
humidity range through week three to four,
[SPEAKER_00]: and only really stepping it down into like
the 50% and potentially below in the very
[SPEAKER_00]: last few weeks of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have not seen any more problems with
plant disease at those higher humidities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I feel like running that 70%
humidity through well through the first
[SPEAKER_00]: half of flour has actually been beneficial
in preventing powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, I feel like I've definitely
clearly seen, I've dealt with powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew we've had a few instances,
primarily it comes from genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in new strains and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I have had issues, it's usually
been when there was a problem with the
[SPEAKER_00]: management of the HVAC system so that
there was bigger swings in the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that I've been able to tighten
that band up, which I really attribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: Blaze Dykeman, who is an HVAC specialist
that I brought in two and a half years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really changed some things about how
we run the air conditioners and the
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really run the dehumidifiers very
little now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's using like the reheat component of
the air conditioning to heat the air on
[SPEAKER_00]: the supply side so that we're doing most
of the dehumidification with the air
[SPEAKER_00]: handlers versus the dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference in that band and
tightening up that band has just been so
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial to the plant disease cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to maintain like a 5% humidity
band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when we were using the
dehumidifiers, there's 18 dehumidifiers in
[SPEAKER_00]: each room, the band would swing sometimes
20% from peak humidity to low humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again every hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that was a big driver of
disease spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think you're right on spot on with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting back to this idea you
mentioned, you're bringing in new
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every room, you're changing so many dials,
it's really hard to know exactly what's
[SPEAKER_02]: making a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a really important thing to
highlight because if we want to do a
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled experiment, it really does need
to be across a few different cultivars so
[SPEAKER_02]: we can get an idea of the genetic
diversity that's in cannabis and how it
[SPEAKER_02]: responds to a given mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where this, getting back to
this R&D room that you mentioned you wish
[SPEAKER_02]: you had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, every time we consult with someone,
that's the first thing I look for on their
[SPEAKER_02]: design is to make sure they have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not only an R&D room,
but it's also a quarantine space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you bring in new genetics,
you need to be testing those genetics to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure they're clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need to grow them out to make sure
that they don't have pests because some
[SPEAKER_02]: things will pupate in the leaves or in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to wait, give them time to
really make sure that they're clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely highlight that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A question, you brought up a ton of really
great stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A question I had though, going back was
all the way to CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, how do you disperse that
evenly across the room being that CO2 is
[SPEAKER_02]: heavier than air?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your method for making sure that
this massive vertical difference that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have across canopies stays as relatively
even as you can?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's definitely very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CO2 injects into one of the dock
socks on one of the air handlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially the air handlers then just
moving it through the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to be perfect because
they're not always running when the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: would inject.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it definitely isn't perfectly
homogenized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a lot of horizontal fans in
the room that are moving in a serpentine
[SPEAKER_00]: design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a serpentine design on each
tier where one row is blowing one way and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the next row is blowing the opposite
way for each of the four rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is replicated on the second and
third tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think just having that high volume
of vertical air movement, plus there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some vertical fans in the rooms as well,
and just keeping that air stirred really
[SPEAKER_00]: well is just our best strategy for
homogenizing all of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inevitably, the air flow and the climate
are not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have sensors on the third tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have sensors on the first tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the Argus control system,
which gives us a lot of data, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: over the environmental set points in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's extremely helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I've installed just some smaller,
cheap sensors to be able to see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening on the third tier compared to
the ground floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third tier definitely has more
swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the air handlers are all up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's substantially cooler when the air
conditioning is running.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can heat up quite a bit as the heat in
the room rises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see bigger swings up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've done over the years is
generally I just plant the shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars on the third tier, the ones that
have kind of a more compact canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory with that is just that these
shorter, stockier plants that have this
[SPEAKER_00]: more compact canopy are able to hold kind
of a boundary of humidity within their own
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sort of boundary layer that those
shorter plants create themselves is a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just a workflow management
thing, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a plant that has a ton of
stretch and you're trellis training it and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing all this work to harvest it and
detrellis it, it's much easier for that to
[SPEAKER_00]: be on the ground floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can just pay more attention to
it without having to get up on a scissor
[SPEAKER_00]: lift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those compact, more compact plants just
work better from a labor perspective as
[SPEAKER_00]: well on the third tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I've started doing
maybe two years ago was using air movers
[SPEAKER_00]: on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like a basic, big air mover fan
that you plug in that can really blow a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of air down the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put those at the ends of the aisles on
each side of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we noticed specifically was
the back corners of the room on the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: tier had a lot of problems with pests or
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just an airflow issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like creating kind of a pocket
back there where there wasn't much air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And heat would kind of build up in those
back corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would see things like thrips kind
of setting in in those back corners of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms because there just wasn't any good
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we put an air mover in those
back corners and we're always like blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: air out of that back corner of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps to just kind of keep that
air stirring on the floor as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that probably helps with your CO2
because your CO2 is going to come settle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you have this air movement,
not just above the canopy, but on the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor, you're moving air off of the floor
and kind of redistributing it back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was another question I was
going to ask you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you typically see most of your pathogen
and pest issues and plant stress stuff on
[SPEAKER_02]: the top canopy because it does have more
fluctuation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the first year that we were in
production, we only ran on two tiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second year we moved into the
third tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely took some time to figure
out how best to manage the climate there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also I mean, there's just like it's
it's multiple things because it's not just
[SPEAKER_00]: the climate, but it's just the individual
workers often can spend less time on the
[SPEAKER_00]: third tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just there's less eyes up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be catching something as
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have quite a good scouting program
so that we're making sure that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at all the plants every day and
that sort of thing from a kind of a bird's
[SPEAKER_00]: eye view as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's still difficult to get the
same amount of attention to the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: tiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everything is just more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, things take twice as long on
the second tier, but they take four times
[SPEAKER_00]: as long on the third tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just as simple as harvesting
the plants on the ground floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just cutting them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're carrying them over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're weighing them on the second tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're you're handing them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the third tier, you're binning
them and running them like we actually run
[SPEAKER_00]: them down like a pulley sort of thing to
drop them down in a bin to the people on
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're running that pulley back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything on the third tier takes
longer, and it's just more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the benefit of the third tier is
it also doesn't have a top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first and the second tier have
essentially a roof, which is the bench of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tier above them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the third tier is just open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did play around a little bit with
that because I was concerned about the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioners being up there, which
occasionally, you know, you have something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's leaking or a pipe that's clogged or
just a machine that freezes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the dehumes used to freeze a lot when
we use the dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're leaking water on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did experiment with like putting
like a plexiglass ceiling on the third
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as we were able to better manage
the equipment and dial that in more on a
[SPEAKER_00]: control system side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the big benefit of getting a
person working in the building on a daily
[SPEAKER_00]: basis, it's like an HVAC specialist and
it's really able to like do the
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative maintenance in a more
complete way.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we had less and less problems with the
machines, then I decided just to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: that third tier roof essentially,
because there is so much air that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: stirred up there just from the air
handlers running all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found actually that due to the
increased airflow up there, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a bigger swing in humidity and
temperature, you have substantially more
[SPEAKER_00]: air moving on the top and then it probably
offsets a lot of the disease pressure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would get from those swings just with
that amount of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you're up there, you just,
I mean, it's just like blasting you when
[SPEAKER_00]: the air conditioners are on and you can
see the plants even on the camera just
[SPEAKER_00]: really waving really hard in the third
tier when all that air flows up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it kind of balances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving the plants up and down,
you talked about dust management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you seeing more issues with microbials
and stuff with our things from the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: ending up on the buds as you go to the
lower levels from that top level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, during the transplanting,
there's definitely an amount of soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: gets stirred up and we see that just on
like the filters on the HVAC equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we wait until we do the
transplant, then we change all the filters
[SPEAKER_00]: because just from that one day of
transplanting, there's so much dust that's
[SPEAKER_00]: created that the filters just get dirty
from one day like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once the plants are in place and
they're starting to get watered in,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't really see much more problems as
far as dust management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do after the plants are in place for a
week or two, do a full cleaning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: benches with the plants in place so we can
eliminate all that dust and that can
[SPEAKER_00]: include wiping down the lights and the
crossbars and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to do that early in flower so
that you're not moving microbes around
[SPEAKER_00]: once the flowers developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once that initial cleaning is done,
which we like to just have that occur
[SPEAKER_00]: about the third week of flower,
then we haven't really seen too many
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with dust or microbes coming from
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use any sort of mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of mulch because I like
indoors because I mean, I love it
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, but indoors, I think it can host
problems like fungus gnats and different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to be able to see that dry back
and have that top layer of the soil dry
[SPEAKER_00]: out enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that we can control things like
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus we also do the top dress and we do
applications of like stradial alipscomitis
[SPEAKER_00]: that predator might in the soil to combat
things like thrips and fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to have the top layer of the
soil unmulched, but it does become
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging like when you harvest the
plants, especially if they're really long,
[SPEAKER_00]: tall cultivars, trying to cut down the
plants and making sure none of the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: drags into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we do, and again, I think we have
the luxury of being able to pay a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to these plants individually
because we are a smaller grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: is anytime a bud touches the soil,
that goes into a fresh frozen batch and
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't get sold as flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just eliminate the risk by if we
know bud is touching soil, it just doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get tested for a panel air.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing some foliar applications too
that I assume would sort of rinse the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants a little bit too of any dust that
might've got on them at transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so foliar applications are
interesting because outdoor farming for
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, I did a lot of foliar feeds,
foliar microbial products for disease
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course you're dealing with rain
washing those products off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of the product mix rates
are designed sort of for outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may, I don't know how people are
making the mix rates that work for these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, pesticide companies,
but my suspicion is that that's taken into
[SPEAKER_00]: account how long that product will
actually stay on the leaves until it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be reapplied and that rain do
things like that are a factor in how long
[SPEAKER_00]: it persists on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors of course, when you spray
something on a plant, it's gonna stay
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna wash it off, there's no
rain, there's no dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have to be careful with what
you're spraying on the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in flower because that might
persist a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did learn a little bit the hard way
with one particular product when I tank
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed it with another one and it kind of
created a population explosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like the product Cicillat from
BioWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacillus subtilis I think is a great tool
for disease prevention, whether it's cease
[SPEAKER_00]: or serinate or there's a host of products
obviously that use Bacillus subtilis as
[SPEAKER_00]: the active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've used quite a bit of that in
indoor agriculture as a powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are tested for total aerobic count
in Ohio, which a lot of states are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Michigan, for example, is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I primarily use it in veg,
but did use it in the beginning of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Ohio, there's a spray ban after day 21
of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't compliantly use most products
after day 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of products that are on
the list that you can use after day 21,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think are regalia, which I don't
know how you would use that once the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: is formed because it would stay in the
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use things like, I think,
Xeritol and there might be one other kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis specific product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's like a citric acid product or
something like that, that you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the after day 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've always just done all of our
sprays prior to day 21, which is how the
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance was initially established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there was some lobbying from certain
growers to use a couple of things after
[SPEAKER_00]: this spray ban.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we never spray after day 21 as a
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was applying these microbial
products prior to day 21, I never had an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue with the plants, the flower,
then failing for total aerobic until a few
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles ago when we suddenly started to see
a much higher aerobic bacteria count
[SPEAKER_00]: ticking up on a lot of our dry flower
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I had been using, and I actually
found it was very, very effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: is I was tanking mixing Ferticell Explorer
with Cease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by tank mixing those, I was
essentially, my thought was, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: every time you do a foliar spray,
it takes a substantial amount of labor and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an REI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can only pack so many of those
into a cycle if you need your employees
[SPEAKER_00]: working in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, in the beginning, did no foliar
applications on the plants because of just
[SPEAKER_00]: my fear of failing for something that
you're spraying on the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first few years I did no foliar
applications at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started using a little bit of the
Ferticell Explorer, which is a soy protein
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolysate, as a boost to increase our
yields a bit and give it a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailable nitrogen as a foliar
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was also using Cease as a
biofungicide, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought, well, why don't I just
tank mix them and this way we can save one
[SPEAKER_00]: spray and have less REI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in doing so, I found that the,
and this is just theory essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think I feel pretty confident that
this is what's been going on, is it was
[SPEAKER_00]: making the bacteria and the Cease live
much longer, kind of go through like a
[SPEAKER_00]: population explosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think what was potentially
happening was by feeding the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: like this nitrogen, and also the nitrogen
potentially being somewhat sticky,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was making like a sticker effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were seeing the aerobic counts go
way, way up once we tank mix those two
[SPEAKER_00]: products together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also was very effective at controlling
pottery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had previously had some pottery
mildew in the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were worried it was going to persist
into the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started tank mixing those
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it was like gone through the
whole facility and never came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the risk is that when you're using a
live product that's like a bacillus
[SPEAKER_00]: subtilis, you could fail your total
aerobic count for something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially a beneficial microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be very careful with
foliars because changing the mix rate or
[SPEAKER_00]: changing, if you're tank mixing things,
of course it can have unintended
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences and they can be beneficial to
the health of the plant, but then can lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to a potential fail if you're not really
staying on top of your test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And watching trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once we started seeing that trend,
we're like, okay, this might be too much
[SPEAKER_00]: of a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we need to go back to eliminating
that or not applying them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So foliars are always tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just of the philosophy of with
indoor production, you want to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: careful about how many you apply and at
what rates because they can persist on the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and there's no rain to wash them
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're coming back and doing a
water spray and removing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that creates more of a risk of
plant disease because you're wetting the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like in vegetable production
outside, you want to be careful about how
[SPEAKER_00]: much you wet the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not a big fan of wetting leaves
indoors, unless of course you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good airflow and the plants are
going to dry very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really interesting anecdote
and experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate you sharing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to change topics just for the sake
of time because we've already been talking
[SPEAKER_02]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to get one more question in
because I know people would love to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: to answer this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is your thought process around
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know you don't reuse the soil because
we talked about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you explain your reasoning behind this
and why that that's your policy at
[SPEAKER_02]: Galenas?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, there's definitely been a lot
of pushback from ownership to reuse the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, which I completely understand
because the cost of buying new soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: One reason though, well, let's let's start
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am definitely a proponent of reusing
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to reuse my own soil at home all
the time for my garden plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: my potted plants, flowers, all these sort
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that if you have the right
system in place to properly reamend your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and store it properly so that you can
reuse it, probably makes the most sense if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the equipment and the
infrastructure to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the footprint that we're on,
we don't even have enough space to park
[SPEAKER_00]: our cars, let alone reamend soil and store
it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we're right in downtown
Akron and we're very tight spot there that
[SPEAKER_00]: we just don't have the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realistically, if we were to reuse
soil, it would have to get hauled
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else, reamended and then sent
back to us, which I don't know if that
[SPEAKER_00]: would offset the cost very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as reusing a soil in the same
pot, I mean, just not possible in a 10
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, by the end of the cycle,
these plants are all roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's really not a whole lot of
soil left.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I have done to kind of find the
best of both worlds there is first,
[SPEAKER_00]: before Golinas established their Michigan
facility, which has now been up and
[SPEAKER_00]: running for three years, I was donating
all of that soil to a community garden
[SPEAKER_00]: group called Let's Grow Akron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were gladly bringing a truck
every month to fill up with all the spent
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and take that out to their community
gardens and use it to build their beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that went on for about a year and a
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once the Golinas Michigan grow was in
effect, I talked with our compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: agents, made sure that it was okay that we
could ship root, you know, chop the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: down and ship the root ball and the soil
to our Michigan ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been great in the sense that
we put it directly into the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: we've taken a field of seven acres that
was almost pure clay and really
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically improved it by adding these
hundreds of yards of soil quarterly to the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does get reused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only gets reused in the other facility
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other reason that I'm just hesitant to
reuse soil indoors is because I really,
[SPEAKER_00]: with such a short cycle, I really need
things to be, I don't want to say perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: because not every batch of soil is exactly
the same, but I need it to be as optimized
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible coming in so that there's just
no downtime, you know, so that the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: have everything they need as far as soil
structure, nutrient level, all that is
[SPEAKER_00]: close to perfect as it can be each cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not a seven day period of time
where I'm figuring out why the plant isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: performing how I expected it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's such a compressed cycle
that it's just really important for things
[SPEAKER_00]: to start as perfect as possible in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm glad that we have this outlet
that we can send the soil and it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that working with a community
garden group or working with another farm
[SPEAKER_00]: to take that soil and repurpose it is a
total excellent waste stream management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Process because it still has a lot of
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't have the value that I need
it for to grow a crop in this system that
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to produce a certain yield each and
every time and a certain quality each and
[SPEAKER_00]: every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like it's a risk management
as well as a space limitation issue for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's, you know, I think that's
great that you're able to kind of explain
[SPEAKER_02]: the thought process behind it because I
knew people would ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to mention too, one,
I kind of call it my secret weapon,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do add, I do a lot with
vermicomposting at The Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that was something that was a
little bit difficult to bring into
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've now set it up outside of the
facility because of the just the bugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, you know, that you get obviously
when you have like some really vibrant
[SPEAKER_00]: worm bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that we've established these
outdoor worm bins, bringing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vermicompost, using that in like an
extract on a weekly basis or even biweekly
[SPEAKER_00]: basis and the veg cycle has made like a
dramatic improvement in our plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found a review, which maybe you
could put up on your page that I've been,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been even like carrying it around
with me for the past six or eight months,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I keep kind of looking back and
forth at it when I'm at work and thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about why is this working so good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are these worm castings that I make
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they so effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I, I was taught as
when I first started farming for Great
[SPEAKER_00]: Lakes Brewing Company by another person
who was a big proponent of worm farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've always used it in my vegetable
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Models in my home grow and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that it's really not that
difficult to create your own worm castings
[SPEAKER_00]: and use them in an indoor commercial
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take a lot, you know,
so they're really packed with nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and enzymes and microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can multiply that out in an
extract and hit a thousand plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: them and really get a lot of bang for your
buck with your own worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried packaged worm castings,
prepackaged worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't find them to be as live or as
effective as what I find when I make my
[SPEAKER_00]: own worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's just a really
undeveloped tool still for commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to really revamp their microbial
activities of their soils, and also just
[SPEAKER_00]: basically provide more bioavailable
nutrients and have like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the humic substances and all the
different things that come from worm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings packaged right in there so that
you're breaking down the nutrients that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the soil more quickly and providing
them in like a plant available format much
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just see incredible difference even,
especially in the veg cycle where we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: apply a worm casting extract on Friday,
and it's like the plants have like doubled
[SPEAKER_00]: in size on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really unbelievable all the
benefits that vermicompost has with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're meant to be for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll share the link to the paper on
the podcast page for people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just really quickly, what is your
bedding that you're using and what are you
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding your worms?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the worms are just getting all food
scraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have my employees, all they're
interested in bringing in their food
[SPEAKER_00]: scraps, take home a three gallon bucket
once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they bring it back on Tuesdays full of
compost and we feed that directly to the
[SPEAKER_00]: worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do also use a lot of the, like when you
buy an Amazon package and you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: brown paper, that's the packing material,
you know, as a bigger operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get a lot of Amazon packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we get a lot of that brown packing
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just tell my employees that
bring back their food scraps, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's everything pre-plate, nothing
post-plate so we don't have like salad
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing and things like that involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just your pre-plate, vegetable
trimmings, eggshells, coffee grounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee filters, any sort of fruits and
vegetables without a super concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: of sometimes like, I think it's good to
just have a good mix, like not all onions
[SPEAKER_00]: or not all lemons or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just don't swing your pH too much
in your worm bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, it's just food scraps and
brown carbon type papers, newspapers,
[SPEAKER_00]: brown packing paper and no soil,
just straight food scraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have four large bins now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make my bins so that the worms
can go into the ground when it gets really
[SPEAKER_00]: cold outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use hardware cloth underneath the
bins and cut big round holes in the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they can just migrate into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets too cold, you're not killing
your worms and like a real deep freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found just from my own personal
experience, I've had one of these bins in
[SPEAKER_00]: my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time they stay through the
whole winter as long as you keep feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if not, they repopulate again in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just manage them so that I always
have old castings toward the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bin and feeding in the fresh food at the
front of the bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when we do pull the castings,
there's not a ton of worms left in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there are, we do put them in the
pots because they will make their way back
[SPEAKER_00]: out into the world and they do live
through the whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we try not to put too many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them in the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's primarily just worm castings put
into like a large compost tea bag soaked
[SPEAKER_00]: in 40 gallons of water and kind of
massaging the bag so that you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: all the extract into the water and then
watering that into the plants once or
[SPEAKER_00]: twice a week through veg into like week
one of flower if there's the time for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But especially in the veg cycle,
I feel like it's just like a total
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant that then you're creating like a
biodiversity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That starts the whole cycle of beneficial
growth for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, in that review, there's even
one study that was done on cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: vermicompost that showed that even if you
soaked seed in vermicompost extract that
[SPEAKER_00]: they saw greater yield down the road with
the cannabis just from simply soaking the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think on the inoculation side,
there's really a lot that we still haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: learned about how beneficial this can
actually be for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a few thoughts on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and again, the article will be
available on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vermicompost is incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that worms are able to take and
translocate nutrients into more plant
[SPEAKER_02]: available forms, increase biological
diversity and nutrient cycling in soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a ton of a ton of incredible
benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: The things that I think of also though
with this is when we talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency and we talk about compost or
vermicompost, I just want to remind
[SPEAKER_02]: listeners that that's not we're not all
applying the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vermicompost using these studies is
probably different than your vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think trialing this is really
important and seeing what results are
[SPEAKER_02]: getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, your mix is working really well
in your facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in general, it's much harder
to screw up vermicompost than it is
[SPEAKER_02]: compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's just something I want to
throw out there because with with compost
[SPEAKER_02]: tea, for example, people take research on
that and try and extrapolate results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every tea is different, just for sure,
even even more so than when making an
[SPEAKER_02]: extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the freshness is really
important, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, yeah, well, I think there's
something to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you could maybe achieve if you
were to use packaged or commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: vermicompost to, you know, get it to the
right moisture level again, maybe add some
[SPEAKER_02]: food sources to it to reinvigorate the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could maybe get back to the same level
of what you're achieving or at least
[SPEAKER_02]: closer to it based on what you're sharing
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other thing I want to mention and
I've been hearing more and more about is
[SPEAKER_02]: this idea of PFAs or PFAS being in
cardboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've moved away using it for sheet
mulching.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do wonder if some of it could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I don't know how this is broken
down by worms or by things, but I've moved
[SPEAKER_02]: away from using it as bedding to in worm
bins for that reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, this is a really new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still learning about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even have available testing for
it in most cases, and it's certainly not
[SPEAKER_02]: being tested for in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like with microplastics and PFAS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's with so many things, you know,
because everything has some amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals and everything has some
amount of of plastics and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that, you know, you're really
there's nothing that's pure and nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's truly clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that as this review is
pointing out, there's there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible amount of remediation that
these microbes that are either in the
[SPEAKER_00]: worm's gut or that kind of coexist in a
symbiotic relationship with worms have an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of being able to biodegrade even
things like these types of chemicals that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're finding from plastics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in that study, it did even point
something out about PFAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of a lot of real
value to the sort of remediation factor
[SPEAKER_00]: that vermicompost provides that could even
potentially remediate things that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil prior to adding the vermicompost,
such as heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that it's quite an
interesting compound that vermicompost
[SPEAKER_00]: creates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, like I said, using it fresh I think
makes a big difference because all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these enzymes and different microbial all
this microbial activity is just is still
[SPEAKER_00]: so vibrant and diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's really kind of a new
frontier of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting because in indoor
agriculture, it's somewhat more
[SPEAKER_00]: applicable, you know, in the field,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a lot of sheet composting in my
field with spent grains from the brewery
[SPEAKER_00]: process, which is a great warm food,
by the way, spent grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they love that would come up and feed
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could really build your worm
populations with spent grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did a lot of sheet composting using
cardboard and things like that for
[SPEAKER_00]: mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can obviously encourage large worm
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe there's some degree of of toxic
compounds and some of these things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using that could negatively
contribute to your soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in indoor applications, it's difficult
to find something that you can make in
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a small amount that doesn't take a
lot of work, but you can spread it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: get the benefit to all the plants in the
form of an inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just really feel like
vermicomposting is one of those sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: special things that you can actually
instead of just buying your inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can create your own live input in a
very simplified manner that doesn't take
[SPEAKER_00]: very much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually quite engaging to the
employees to be able to bring in their
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and see it broken down by worms
and go back to contributing to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually really stimulated some
people to start composting at home who
[SPEAKER_00]: were not composting previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's something that's small,
but that you can multiply out on a fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale and provide like a really
substantial amount of benefit to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants through a very simple and small
sort of system that doesn't take very much
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it was one way of bringing sort
of that outdoor regenerative agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: or world indoors in a system that so far,
at least I haven't seen any negatives in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense of higher heavy metal loads on
my flower or a microbe that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's like some degree of
balance that these microbes create that
[SPEAKER_00]: are working in harmony to balance the
negative pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of detail in that review
too about the pathogens suppressing
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of vermicompost to even be able
to negate things like fusarium and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases that are very serious for
cannabis that could be potentially offset
[SPEAKER_00]: or prevented by using vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of interesting stuff,
a lot of interesting uses for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vermicompost is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different ways we can use
it in our gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I highly recommend that people set up
their own vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot more we could talk
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may have to schedule another chat
sometime in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you having me, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, when I launched into the
cannabis industry, like almost six years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, your podcast gave me a ton of
knowledge and confidence to be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that I do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the collaboration that you
provide to the industry just can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: valued enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still, unfortunately, a lot of
people that are very tight-lipped about
[SPEAKER_00]: what they do and what techniques are
working for them or not working for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it holds back the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: In vegetable production, there was much
more collaboration, much more sharing of
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I stepped into cannabis,
I felt like closed off to other farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your podcast really, it's very
exciting for me to be here because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of come full circle that it was so
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me to hear these voices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've networked with a lot of people
that you've had on the podcast now and
[SPEAKER_00]: created long lasting relationships with
people specifically from hearing them
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope we can stay in touch because I
think you're totally right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more we can collaborate in this
industry, the more transparency we have,
[SPEAKER_02]: the better off we all are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially in promoting this side of
the industry, this concept of regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture and more sustainable
cultivation and organics and things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it in the craft brewery industry all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my husband being a brewer,
he even says to me, all these brewers come
[SPEAKER_00]: from other breweries all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We open the doors and we greet them with
open arms and we share knowledge and share
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's part of what makes craft brewing
so special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's finally kind of coming
full circle in Ohio where there is a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more collaboration now and industry wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see it just get better and
better with the education and the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and the sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're on the right track.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
