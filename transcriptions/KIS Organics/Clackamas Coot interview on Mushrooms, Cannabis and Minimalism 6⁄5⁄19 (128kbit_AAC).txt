[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Jim, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to chat with you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to talk with you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've talked a lot off air,
but I wanted to record a video because I
[SPEAKER_01]: know there's a lot of people that have
wanted to hear from you and hear what
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know personally you're less involved
with the cannabis scene as you used to be
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've been getting more into
mushrooms, but do you want to just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: fill people in on what's been going on in
your life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to pay off our house a few
months ago and I don't know, I just
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to remodel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been here 17 years and got rid of 17
years of junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through 17 years of computer
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I buy this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been kind of a semi-approach to
minimalism, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really got really, really tired of being
involved on any level at the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: scene, so I contract my growing to
somebody that I trust outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get extremely nice yield of high quality
flowers and let everybody go have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for some recreation, I guess you'd
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy growing things,
still do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got involved in growing mushrooms and
working with a fellow that you would know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is SetItAndForgetItOrganics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked through some different recipes
for the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the books that I used was Organic
Mushroom Farming and Soil Remediation by a
[SPEAKER_00]: gentleman from North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first how-to book that actually
mentioned things like earthworm castings,
[SPEAKER_00]: rock dust, so I kind of felt a kindred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been really fun and growing
your own food.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as the medicine on the lion mane
and what you would know as maitake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some in the Northwest refer to it as hen
of the woods, but there's several turkey
[SPEAKER_00]: tail and other mushrooms that we can grow
that have long established histories in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of medicinal primarily out of Asia,
China, and Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, the food, the culinary
mushrooms are really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow oysters, which are the
easiest mushroom in the world to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I would recommend people start
with so they don't get some stumbling
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wouldn't start out with growing
lion's mane, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably do mushrooms and then kind of
work up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially for the outdoor gardens,
we can use the wine caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are we growing food, but it's
also doing some wonderful things with the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and deconstructing the carbon sources
that are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe like luck, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's better than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You create soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of potty soils have a lot of wood in
it, wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: By using mycelium, we can deconstruct that
and it just adds to the image of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the nutrient profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a win-win.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not only improving the soil,
but we're also growing viable food,
[SPEAKER_00]: good source of B vitamins and protein,
what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a couple of things, a couple of
questions I had, because I am not a
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love eating mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved the interview with Paul Stamets on
the Joe Rogan podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was sort of what some of the stuff
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, stuff around lions mane,
creating new neurological connections in
[SPEAKER_01]: your brain, and some ways that people are
using fungi, which is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always had been a little bit of,
I think there's a term for it and I might
[SPEAKER_01]: have it wrong, but I think it's
mycophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mycophobia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sense of like going out, my brother,
for example, will go out and harvest wild
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes me really nervous,
not knowing what I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because of the dangers associated
with them and learning how to do support
[SPEAKER_01]: prints and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always heard that you need to have
very sterile conditions to grow mushrooms
[SPEAKER_01]: and you need to be very careful and it can
be somewhat dangerous because some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these mushrooms are toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's almost like there's this fear
based thing around mushrooms that is sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of more of the public opinion that it
doesn't sound like is really accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Culturally, that phobia, or whatever we
want to call it, goes back millennia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this isn't something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I suggest people consider is that,
for example, Paul Stamets up at fungi.com,
[SPEAKER_00]: he sells a spawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the part of the process that requires
the sterilization and almost lab
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, we'll say.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect they sent you a link this
morning in preparation for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but several varieties of mushrooms that
you could buy with confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the spawn is already colonized with
the correct, whether it be oysters or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's got shiitake and probably
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's other sources too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for people that are concerned,
I mean, I'm not going to go walk around
[SPEAKER_00]: the Pacific Northwest and go, well,
I think that's a, I mean, take a class.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the American Mycology Association
that has branches and state organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's one or two in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get out with a group of people and an
expert and if you're going to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest take in a class and do a
lot of reading with books that have,
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to get the digital version so it's
on your iPhone or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do some identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of them you're not, I mean,
obviously you're not going to confuse a
[SPEAKER_00]: lion's mane with a toadstool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the other ones that we find
growing on the timber itself, like reishi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those you buy the plugs, they're
already inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you drill a hole and you insert the
plug and away you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably the path of alleviating
some of those concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people send me pictures, what do you
think this is?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we want to offer an opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be cooking and eating it unless
your drunken brother-in-law is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always start with a positive
identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a disclaimer to throw out
there to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And barring that, until you feel
comfortable, then I would buy spawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inoculated or colonized medium,
more often than not wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know, for example, Doug at Northwest
Redworms he used to grow oysters,
[SPEAKER_00]: the white oysters, the standard one I
guess you'd say, in these plastic bags
[SPEAKER_00]: that you hang from the rafters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always got pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did you use as a medium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, newspaper and coffee grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I saw a video, I'll find it
for you, but the guy grew it on old tennis
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, this is really an important
thing, I think, in this whole discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungi was here before plants,
which preceded the animal kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be around long after
the insects are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the role that one of the most
important books a person could read I
[SPEAKER_00]: think is, I think you read, you have a
copy of this, Mycelium Running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that should be like the primer
for anybody to get a grasp of how much
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, the role it plays in our world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're primary decomposers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you say an old shoe or coffee
grounds, they're going to be one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that's really efficient at breaking
down carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for example, a popular one would be
straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you've got a good source of
lignin and carbon, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started thinking it through,
then I was like, wait a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are they doing in Asia?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look, and rice hulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for me, it's a lot easier messing
around with rice hulls and getting a bale
[SPEAKER_00]: of whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can just run up to Concentrates
and get the stamp like you buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell it by the pound or 50 pounds or
by cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a lot of rice hulls for under 20
bucks, I can tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have to mess around with
straw, trying to bust up a bale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though, I have done some work with another
gentleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used bales of straw that we picked
up from a feed store, and put some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: colonized spawn, use that to then
inoculate the straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're working with colonized spawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know essentially what you're saying
is you don't need sterile media to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: that spawn out based on- Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the way that I was taught,
and we use pasteurized substrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: not sterilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to go back to your
expertise and history with dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes in a soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want a completely sterile
medium because nature abhors a vacuum,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you pasteurize it, you're still
leaving, and I really dislike using this
[SPEAKER_00]: phrase, but this is a popular one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You leave the good guys there,
the good microbes there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pasteurization, which just simply means
you're soaking the material and water it
[SPEAKER_00]: between 160 and 180 Fahrenheit for a
period of, well, I'll go with an hour and
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is going to give you a clean
substrate, but it's not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so especially if you're growing the
most popular, because it's the easiest one
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow, the most widely grown are the
oyster.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a good way, they're very invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it hits, that substrate,
they take over, and that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like we do with our compost teas,
you want to put add the correct aerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial colonies, which will keep the
anaerobic colonies at bay or destroy them,
[SPEAKER_00]: what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still the same science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it, because you can go to
Amazon right now and for under $20 get a
[SPEAKER_00]: cardboard box with a oyster mushroom start
in it, and you open the box up and set it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get to watch it grow over the next
several days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I think is really cool because it
gets people caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I could do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if they're manufacturing this
wherever and shipping around the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're getting repeat business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously it's not some big feat to
grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would then give the person
confidence to buy the colonized spawn from
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Stamets and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some that you want to maybe grow in a
plastic tub, but other varieties you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: want to put out in your garden like the
wine caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wine cap is actually one of their
nicknames is soil buster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have really hard soils,
you know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather get out the Eltero rototiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use this and plus it's then going
to give you crumb, which you know more
[SPEAKER_00]: about that than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The importance of crumb, the loopy methods
control microbiology in our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just fun, especially it's a
really good learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working with people adding spawn
to their worm bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to raise the fungal level
in the vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're doing that, we're going to
be able to harvest some food.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not pasteurizing the worm bin,
cause that would kill the worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because worm, uh, vermicompost and
the very nature, uh, and its ecosystem is
[SPEAKER_00]: very, uh, I wouldn't want to use the word
antiseptic, but it's a very clean medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We adulterate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not suggesting that we want to
grow in straight worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but that's a very, very pure,
uh, medium to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if a person just took really
quality vermicompost and I've done this
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and mixed it about one part compost
to three parts, uh, vermicompost with the
[SPEAKER_00]: three parts of a rice hulls, which I did,
uh, uh, pasteurize not sterile and then
[SPEAKER_00]: added just some kelp and you're going to
get tired of hearing this, but kelp name,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, kelp name, uh, and malted barley to
the substrate because, uh, the malt fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: are enzyme engines and we already have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, several hundred year history of using
those very enzymes created by barley and
[SPEAKER_00]: bread baking that it's what they call
diastatic malt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's added to the dough to increase the
activity of the yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's yeast yeast is a single cell
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I decided, huh, I wonder if this
will do anything for the ones I was trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow and sure did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went, wow, this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a product for 80 cents a pound
that I added to a substrate recipe and
[SPEAKER_00]: said it, forget it organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's been doing a lot of work with,
uh, on substrate recipes and trying to use
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are, would be easy for people
to locate like, uh, core even coconut
[SPEAKER_00]: core, uh, or sphagnum peat moss or things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, we're trying to use, use every
day, not trying to make it some exact,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause it doesn't need to be, uh,
you know, trying to keep it easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I don't, you know, there's,
there's some good books out there and one
[SPEAKER_00]: is, uh, not exactly the most exciting
name, but it's called mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's strictly about outdoor gardens
adding different varieties of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, edible mushrooms that we can use and
not only to improve the tilt in our garden
[SPEAKER_00]: plots, but also provide us with a good
viable protein source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for vegetarians and even, uh,
vegans, this is a good alternative for a
[SPEAKER_00]: meat-free diet or people like yourself
just, yeah, I like the taste of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, Yeah, I actually would spark this
cause I knew you were doing this journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: In doing these experiments with various
mushrooms and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I went over to my mother's house out
in Fort Ludlow and she had gone to the
[SPEAKER_01]: local farmer's market and picked up some
fresh oyster mushrooms and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, flavor on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit of a meaty flavor,
almost a little bit like chicken,
[SPEAKER_01]: but different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want people to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's like chicken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it was good and so much
healthier, you know, to be eating this
[SPEAKER_01]: that, uh, other than the price cause they
were expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they were, they were great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it made me think about ways I could
start growing these at home and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and learning more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I really, I really did enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, uh, one of one way is, uh,
to use, go over to a Home Depot or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever place like that Walmart,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, uh, tubs, the storage tubs,
the, uh, the, like Rubbermaid,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use those even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if it didn't pan out,
then, uh, you know, you'd still have a
[SPEAKER_00]: storage tub or, you know, mixed soil or
whatever, you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, it just, you put a
substrate in there, find a recipe that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're comfortable with that makes sense
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I can't, it's hard for me to
envision.
[SPEAKER_00]: How anybody could really fail with,
uh, something like, uh, the oyster
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just that easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started a hundred years ago at the,
after, uh, during world war one in Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: and out of necessity feed the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after, in the twenties and
thirties, it spread like wildfire
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that it became a, it's a major crop in
China and, and India because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a lot of protein and you don't
have to, it's not like trying to grow an
[SPEAKER_00]: exotic plant, like say orchids,
you're not going to break the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about, you know,
growing mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really like a poor man's a hobby,
which appealed to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent enough, uh, time and effort and
money on growing learns thinking I did to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow cannabis, you know, or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, this is really, uh, and it's
almost incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you get, you see the results of
your work in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say I wanted to try going oyster
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've talked a little bit about
this process already.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said they're the easiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take me through all the steps from
beginning to end, you know, like going to
[SPEAKER_01]: the website, ordering the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What should I have at home before the
spawn arrives?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to have your substrate
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the beauty is that commercially
some of the things that are used to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: oysters are really intriguing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you know, uh, my good friend,
uh, Doug over at Northwest, he was using,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, newsprint and, uh, coffee grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, not, and not just
getting one crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one cycle, you know what they call,
uh, anyway, is there like a pH range
[SPEAKER_01]: though?
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's, here's the thing when you say
coffee grounds and newsprint, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not going to a very nutrient rich
source for these mushrooms, which makes me
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder if these mushrooms might be a
little less nutritious than if I had grown
[SPEAKER_01]: them in a, in a, you know, higher,
higher nutritive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really, really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one that I can't give you,
uh, a specific answer to, but I have
[SPEAKER_00]: wondered the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the reasons I bought the book,
uh, organic mushroom farming is that that
[SPEAKER_00]: issue is addressed to some degree by
instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember when you first showed up at,
uh, or we did, I mean, I'm about the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time over at ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember how much bad information there
was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well imagine that you'd been there 10
years earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: About how bad it could have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's where the mushroom forms are
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's appalling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I read things like, well,
yeah, you want to add, uh, limestone
[SPEAKER_00]: because you need all those minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what nutrients are we talking?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I want nutrients, I use basalt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something besides just calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, and kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the richest, uh, plant on the
earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a kelp story to tell you,
but, uh, just, just to simplify things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you're, you're saying,
uh, for a substrate that that's what you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to have ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're recommending starting with
something I think you mentioned rice holes
[SPEAKER_00]: or yes, that's your carbon source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or yeah, that's your carbon for,
I mean, you can use straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more traditional straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I live in, you know, the city and
I got to drive 15 miles to a feed store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then God knows how, you know,
the whole drill, at least with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the rice holes that I get from
concentrates are organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cross your fingers, you know,
uh, with rice holes, I worry about,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, arsenic levels potentially being an
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a heavy metal perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just talk organic straw for,
so let me try and find a source of organic
[SPEAKER_01]: straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would sit in a tub.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would, you heat the water to between a
hundred and a hundred and eight degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: and keep it there for you said at least an
hour and 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, to make sure that we've pasteurized
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what happens then do you need to
get the spawn on it right away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what you do, you're going to,
uh, you want to drain and squeeze out as
[SPEAKER_00]: much white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember fungi are for many, many decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was taught at universities that fungi
were a subset of the plant kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now know that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're closer to animals in this regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use oxygen and expel CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want that substrate, like our soils
in this regard, you want it moist,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't want it drenched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so, uh, what I do is I just get,
uh, I got some a hundred percent cotton,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, pillowcases, put this substrate in
there and just squeeze it and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, keep twisting it and twist and
get as much water and then let it hang
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe for a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, no, it's not like, okay,
we got a rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you want to be, take caution,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, when you'll know the
consistency, you want it so that it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's that word we use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so loamy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So air passages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you dump in your, uh,
spawn, which in the case of, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: oysters, they're probably, I'm not sure
what Mr. Stamets is using, but let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: it's chips, wood chips or shavings or what
have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I found it easier in my experiments to
use organic sorghum or Milo, whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it is really inexpensive because
it's, uh, it's a feedstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably feed it to your chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's part of the mix of your,
uh, chicken, um, mash or whatever it's
[SPEAKER_00]: called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, because, uh, sorghum has a shell
like corn, popcorn, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we have found that to be easy to
inoculate and colonize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, you're kind of wide
open, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're mixing that in with the straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're adding neem and kelp and
rock dust to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just sprinkle it in just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, about like what I did with,
uh, soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, say a cup of, uh,
neem to cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a cup of kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a funny, that's an interesting
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, studies that I downloaded from
India using neem and Karanja, not only did
[SPEAKER_00]: it suppress the contaminants as the term
is used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increased the yield factor on the fruit
that they were actually wanting to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it was oysters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which sounds, well, if it's a
fungicide, yeah, but it's not a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't want to get into that
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's one of the silliest conversations
in the cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, so just out of, uh, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started adding kelp or excuse me,
a neem meal to the, uh, recipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw the same thing, a suppression of
contaminants and an increase in the yield
[SPEAKER_00]: of the, the target, uh, fruit that we were
trying to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one nice thing about oysters is
they're, they have a very distinctive
[SPEAKER_01]: look, so you can feel pretty confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you're not getting something,
some contaminant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the contaminants are usually that's
kind of like soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember we used to talk about,
uh, on the cannabis boards that if you see
[SPEAKER_00]: the term was mold, I think, uh,
if it's this color, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's that color, you're not so fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so blues and greens, you don't want to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: White is, you know, we're, we're dancing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the same thing in the
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, you know, you start seeing green and
just call it a day and talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're talking about molds,
not actual fruiting mushroom caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying if you see mold growing in
the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all has to do with color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to, you're going to see
white, which is what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, just like in our soils,
we didn't want to see what pinks,
[SPEAKER_00]: blues, and greens, if my memory serves me
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only ever saw white, so I never
concerned myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have to poke holes in the,
uh, pillowcase or will it actually grow
[SPEAKER_01]: right through the cotton?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, I just meant, I use that to get as
much water out of the substrate as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're growing it in, you then put it
into a tub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you, you drill some two inch
holes for ventilation and use that tape
[SPEAKER_00]: that if, uh, they use on bandages,
uh, you can see through it, but it has
[SPEAKER_00]: little like microscopic type holes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that to cover that, that, uh,
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, contaminants getting into your tub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, I mean, you buy it at,
you know, any by, uh, where you get your
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriptions, you know, drug store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that, that tape you use to wrap
around your bandage.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your bandage to breathe,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like athletic tape or first aid tape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that first aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the heavy duty stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, uh, it's, I don't know, $3 for,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, 300 feet or something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, you drill these two inch holes
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're back to find out you need
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need good ventilation, but you
don't want, you want to have a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: block the bad guys from getting in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need to put a fan or anything on
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've had some other interesting
ideas going into a aquarium store and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at some of the stuff they use to
create air bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was long, uh, skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking to myself, well, you know,
if you build a frame out of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: put that on the bottom with an air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, this is open to a lot of
investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beauty is that it's not going to
break the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like, well, let me try this
thousand dollar super duper light from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we'd be growing weed or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I didn't work, I didn't,
you know, it didn't pay off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is like a poor man's hobby,
I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long from the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: You inoculate the spore into the straw and
you get it into the tub.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long until we'll start seeing
mushrooms with the, uh, oysters because of
[SPEAKER_00]: how, and I mean this in a positive way,
how invasive they are 10 to 12 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just like, you know,
you're cutting constantly and getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this thing goes on for several
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why, so the, uh, you don't want me
to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're looking at three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how'd you, you know, how'd it pan
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd those seeds work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you don't have that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is like instant gratification
almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're as close as you can get to instant
gratification.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, and the other thing is with the
oysters, uh, sometime when you're bored,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like 22 major varieties and some
of them are just, I mean, they're pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: of art.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could hire a professional photographer
and shoot them and sell postcards of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of the exotic blues and pinks
and all kinds of neat colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's something like, I believe I'm
quoting Paul Stamets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to be careful here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to misquote them,
but something like, uh, 15,000 specific
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of, uh, fungi that are
cultivated either by intent or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount that fruit is fairly
limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for example, uh, morels,
everybody likes morels, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually the fruit of, uh,
ectomycrohysel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we get them at the base of
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the fruit from that, uh,
variety of, uh, fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found that really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some grow in decomposing logs on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some grow on living trees like reishi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's where you find those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and when you buy like say logs,
uh, that are already pre-inoculated,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the big one is, uh, uh, the ones from
Japan, uh, um, shitake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get this log.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, for this discussion, we'll call
it, uh, sawdust held together bound by a
[SPEAKER_00]: resin of some type that's been,
uh, inoculated with the spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a one-time use, but,
uh, that's an easy way to get started too,
[SPEAKER_00]: just for the gratification part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You order and they're not expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you order a log and you grow some
mushrooms or, uh, and it just gives you a
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I did this, you know, so that then
leads you to some that maybe are a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what I'm going to start
with here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a local guy who makes him,
he makes a few different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know I can get the logs from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why Paul Stamets is domiciled up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Pacific Northwest is one of
the epicenters of, uh, well, let's use the
[SPEAKER_00]: word, uh, mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a lot of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, many were native and some were brought
in, you know, just the sort of the human
[SPEAKER_00]: race moving around and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, that would be, if you know
somebody that's putting together the
[SPEAKER_00]: Shiitake logs, that would be way cool just
to have it in your store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people come in and go, look what I
did, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, we had one actually set up
and, uh, uh, this is funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one night our security alarm started
going off and we couldn't figure out what
[SPEAKER_01]: it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing was covered and there was
movement inside our, uh, farm store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out, uh, what had caused it was,
uh, one of the mushroom logs had released
[SPEAKER_01]: spores and then poofed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these spores had hit the camera,
caused the alert to go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no one there, but, uh,
we figured out after the fact that we'd
[SPEAKER_01]: put the mushroom log too close to the
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, I've seen some videos of,
uh, time lapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most fascinating thing that I've
ever been involved in is, uh, just this
[SPEAKER_00]: learning, uh, about, especially for myself
was medicinal mushrooms, the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cordyceps and, uh, the lion's mane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually though, the lion's mane,
there's one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get, and you can find them here in
the Northwest cause this is foodie
[SPEAKER_00]: central, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle, Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get, take fresh, uh, lion's mane
and you cut them into steaks and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: treat it like lobster crab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just spread some butter on it with some
herbs and then grill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what a great, what a great,
uh, you say, uh, you and your wife are
[SPEAKER_00]: having a dinner party.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to impress people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's a non-meat meal that I
prepared for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you could do some things with,
uh, well, my talkie, uh, wood ear oysters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can really create some really
wonderful, uh, now where I come in is I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: a real big bread baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like making artists and pizza doughs
and then using, uh, mushrooms on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not with a ton of cheese either the,
you know, you want the flavors to come
[SPEAKER_00]: through of these wonderful, uh,
things that we grew in our gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I could see like at your farm having
like an exhibit area for the children to
[SPEAKER_00]: see, uh, mushrooms growing and how they're
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then might even turn it into a profit
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can have come pick a mushroom
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, we've tried inoculating some
logs, but we didn't have anyone that was
[SPEAKER_01]: really staying with it and making sure it
was successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's important with any living
organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping to try again once we get the
farm, you know, Well, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right around the corner from Paul
and his operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So picking up the, uh, I don't know if he
has will call or whatever, but even
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping, you're going to have it there
the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's, uh, and his staff are really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good about answering questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I mean, when you go into this
substrate business, I got a couple of guys
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be interested in talking to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, uh, my wife and I have been taking the
lion's mane and a few of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: All Stamets is company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they've been, they've been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels good to take something that's
healthy and safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy a different product, but,
uh, he, uh, he worked for, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Stamets is an extractor for over a
year and then, uh, set up his own business
[SPEAKER_00]: down in Ashland in Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he's got one, uh, product,
all his products are $50 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your prescription or the dosage is
four grams a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 110 days worth a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for $50, it's cheaper than
supplements and, uh, yeah, Paul's Paul
[SPEAKER_01]: steps is expensive, but fortunately we had
a wholesale account because we're retail
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, uh, a lot of the staff and stuff
will get an employee discount and is able
[SPEAKER_01]: to, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the one he, uh, the, uh, John,
I can't remember his name, but anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, he has one that's a 10 varieties and
they're different, uh, primarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I shouldn't have said that,
but a lot of it's from China and have been
[SPEAKER_00]: used in a traditional Chinese medicine for
centuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grown here, just originally, originally.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, like I was telling you
yesterday, a friend of mine, his,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, wife is, uh, is Chinese and they have
a little boy and they're in China right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, visiting grandpa and the aunts and
uncles and what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of his wife's, uh, uncles is owns,
uh, well, an herb traditional medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: store thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you in Chinatown that you'd see in
Portland or CL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave him a list with all the Chinese
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, see if you can get these,
uh, dried and then, uh, we can do,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, this isn't as complicated as I'm
making it sound, but we can do a Jurassic
[SPEAKER_00]: park thing and, uh, get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those, uh, those spores reactivated so
that we can produce them and grow them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like some of the ones that are really
beautiful mushrooms, like turkey tail,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a big, uh, medicinal one and,
uh, cordyceps, which is written.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fascinating of all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, that's the one that will
actually eat insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the zombie fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it will cause them to act.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually affects their neural function
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, that's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, when you get into the
world, it's like, what's really cool about
[SPEAKER_00]: it is that it hasn't been bastardized yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that it can, because my
college is a, is a really big universe to
[SPEAKER_00]: go play in and.
[SPEAKER_00]: There just aren't that many Paul Stamets
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, or people who can explain the big
picture as well as he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so you're not going to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you're never going to see a can of
con for mycologist.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have a, there's an old
song from like almost 55 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the rolling stone and the title of
it, you know, it's all you need to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: is, uh, it's the West coast under assist
the under assistant West coast promotion
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I was looking at,
uh, an upcoming event in Portland in
[SPEAKER_00]: August, like who is going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the first thing I thought it
was that song by the rolling, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: button down, uh, you know, selling the
dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that that is ever really
going to at least, uh, and well,
[SPEAKER_00]: my lifetime, maybe in your lifetime,
I don't think you're going to see that
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be, it would be, it would really
blow my mind if it did, that you would see
[SPEAKER_00]: that the whole thing would get turned on
its head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cannabis sure has changed in your
lifetime quite dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really funny is that I was
thinking about this the other day in a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go back to when Lyndon Johnson was
president.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as our friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were there before it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on this level, you know,
just so many people lighting up or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know, we're supposed to say
getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, you know, we lived through the
whole thing and watched it morph into what
[SPEAKER_00]: it, whatever it is, you know, now,
and it just boggled my mind that in one
[SPEAKER_00]: year, prices could drop 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I mean, there used to be a time
where you could grow some pounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you shuffle them off for 3,200
and you know, it was a nice little adjunct
[SPEAKER_00]: to your income, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but not probably as many as you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to a few, uh, rec farms or
whatever you want to call them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first thought was, man,
you guys are in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I would want to grow
4,000 tomato plants without a big crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scaling is a definite, is a definite
challenge that we deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still like dealing with people that,
uh, you know, still it's in the sunshine
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm just an old curmudgeon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't buy into this garbage about,
uh, no, indoors is the best taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that isn't, but you know, you're just
afraid of being high, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, when I started, when I started,
when I started on this journey,
[SPEAKER_00]: my first crop went to ground 43 years ago
and the word sense of me, uh, hadn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: been popularized yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't know what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, go out and chop down some
weed, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were going to the scene
straight out of Thailand and India and Sri
[SPEAKER_00]: Lanka, what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it started in the late seventies,
early eighties, the name game started out
[SPEAKER_00]: of California course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, all these wacky names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, in the late eighties,
when the two, uh, first of the two major
[SPEAKER_00]: seed companies today, what you would know
as, uh, since these seeds was,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they had a catalog called the SSSC
super sativa seed club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in their listings, they gave credit to
several seeds, it came out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest from a group called sacred
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a reason that Williams wonder
will look on a map and Williams Oregon and
[SPEAKER_00]: wonder Oregon on the opposite side of a
Valley down in Southern arc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the main one of their, what do you
call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the forerunner of many of their
strains is the Afghani hashtag one,
[SPEAKER_00]: number one, Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was one and they, this is,
they're giving them credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought that from sacred seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other big catalog was,
uh, I can't think of his name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but anyway, the seed bank and he hooked up
with, uh, Sam the skunk man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you got the haze and
Northern lights came out of, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: British Columbia, the BCGA British
Columbia growers association and that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's when I saw it change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we don't want all those imports,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can know we'll make it better because I
know this guy that's got this really cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, fill in the blank and I can
cross it with my fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the seed thing was on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never imagined that it would get the
insanity that I'm making a Peyton Manning
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really Obama Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I'm looking at a book right now
that one of the authors is, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Victoria Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see the, uh, birth certificate
on that before I buy into that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, you know, I'm, you know,
I mean the whole, uh, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, grabbing people's genetics and in a,
in a copywriter or whatever that scam is,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, somebody actually I had about
four people tell me, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got some of your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get bastardized with the first
person that buys it because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this guy and he's got this,
you know, special Kush from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever, uh, but Pimple Texas,
man, you know, we're going to cross that
[SPEAKER_00]: and make a super strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still waiting for that super
stream, but you know, so far I retired
[SPEAKER_00]: from the business and said, yeah,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been waiting for 40 years,
but I haven't seen it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still don't, I don't believe that
American breeders for an, and not a
[SPEAKER_00]: criticism, just a statement of fact will
ever hit the levels of several hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: years of hand selected seeds from places
like Sri Lanka and Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in other places, that's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that sense of, uh,
longevity or in terms of, uh, seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: big picture, it's all about immediate
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, okay, here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest, uh, developers of,
uh, dahlias is here in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dahlias are down near a few miles
south of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go to their show every year and the
family's been growing dahlias and breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: them since the 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost, you know, 90 over 90 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking to one of this,
the grandsons or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was telling me, yeah, this took
seven years, you know, to develop this and
[SPEAKER_00]: this one, you know, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Oh man, you need to get some weed
growers in here and these guys can crank
[SPEAKER_00]: out a new strain in matter of a month or
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need, you need to pick up the pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just shook his head and he said,
yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm just saying that, you know,
there's, uh, I don't sense this,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, what are we going to leave the next
generation?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 200 cushions, I don't know,
or, or whatever they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's just the idea now that
using, you know, science, science,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can, uh, and genetic markers,
we could identify, within a particular
[SPEAKER_01]: strain or cultivar varietal, what,
you know, say for example, that specific
[SPEAKER_01]: marker that's associated with,
uh, helping with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So reducing, if we can identify that and
we can increase the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the particular cannabinoid that helps with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we can grow out, you know,
200 different phenotypes and identify
[SPEAKER_01]: within seven days, if it's male,
female, what, what percent of that marker
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to, it's going to express,
then we can really quickly make,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, decisions and, and, and make changes
that would have taken a regular grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, generation and cycle and cycle
to, to actually know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that to me is both scary and exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I hear what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do agree with you that we like,
we don't have the same relationship with
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant that we, that these,
uh, you know, uh, indigenous cultures that
[SPEAKER_01]: the tree that like sacred medicine had and
that they did there was I think much more
[SPEAKER_01]: spiritual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to just throw that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, I don't think the cannabis plant
is just a chemo var or, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a particular expression of these,
uh, chemicals there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more to it than that, you know,
and maybe that's just the spiritual side
[SPEAKER_01]: of me thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, it's, it's, uh, look, we've had 82
years of insanity since the 1937 law was
[SPEAKER_00]: passed at the urging of, uh, DePont and
other big chemical companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the, uh, campaign
politically publicly has been,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's, it's, uh, unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I'm suggesting is, is that the deal
that started in the late eighties with
[SPEAKER_00]: this, you know, there's something magical
about my strains better than your strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think was to the detriment of the plan
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I used to have a tagline on my,
when we were before social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were doing forums, you know,
once you take the look down to a
[SPEAKER_00]: chihuahua, there's no going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of think, uh, that's a little
bit where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, we're, that's a lot where we're
at tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it that we want to grow heirlooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we want flavor and color and,
and, uh, robust plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sick of romas and tomatoes on the
vine, as they call it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just to get in the store, the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, you know, they last the
longest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was in the produce industry for
several years and yeah, your biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: concern is what they call legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the time we pick it, how long optimum
time to get it into a distribution center,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, you were probably
uninterested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, but in the nineties,
Calgene was a big project that involved
[SPEAKER_00]: Monsanto, UC Davis, and they were going to
create the tomato that had the longest
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf life or something by, uh,
replacing one of the, uh, DNA or RNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, from using a potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, they were just stumbling around
with, with the genetic modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, plants and, um, the publicity against
it and the media, it just killed the
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look up Calgene sometime and it
was a mess and it was a harbinger of
[SPEAKER_00]: things to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, um, I don't want to eat Franken
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just trust the people at Monsanto as
much as I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't need your goodwill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where to get tomatoes seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need your garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but the average consumers walking
into, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, there's a line from a song by,
uh, Grace Slick that said, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if my lettuce has DDT on it
as long as it's crisp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where we're at as a
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, but the tomatoes are so
pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, you see those lights they put
in there that hit, you know, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the special lighting that gives you that
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, it's Franken food and all you
need to do is go to a mall and look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of obesity that is struck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or children.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look, diabetes, type two diabetes
used to be an old person's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you got like in your fifties
or sixties from, well, being a dickhead,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, drinking too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I laugh at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I know you're battling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad's battling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, well, yeah, I mean,
you know, we didn't make good decisions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, let's get honest here,
but to see children.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've locked 20, 25 years off their life
expectancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's just horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if we treated our dogs,
like we treat our children, we'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you gave a dog a cup of coffee and a,
you know, Winchell's donut in the morning
[SPEAKER_00]: for breakfast, somebody had probably come
and arrest you for, you know, the animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put, you know, a cook machine in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to have a thriving human
being with all that junk going in their
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies from the time they get up till they
go to bed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and then let's add in the,
let's sit in front of and play whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: the latest in a computer game is on there
or worse or worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll, uh, you only have to walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk around with your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And play, you know, I don't even know the
games anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, that's my, um, but back,
back to the fungi, I think fungi will
[SPEAKER_00]: bring, I know it sounds corny to some,
but I, the more I've delved into this over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last two or three years, I agree with
Paul's standards that fungi will be what
[SPEAKER_00]: saves the human race from itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, that I sincerely believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you're, you just had the
experience of eating fresh, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: oysters the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not be a hard diet to acclimate
yourself to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could say, you know,
I could do without meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could have this quality of protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see moving towards a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a plant, but you get my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: A non, uh, meat, uh, diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I think it has a really big
important role to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can know like from your own experience
that taking the, uh, taking, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, using the oysters, excuse me,
the lion's mane and, and whichever ones
[SPEAKER_00]: you choose the cordyceps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, my, my recipe that I get is,
uh, equal parts by volume or weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, uh, Rishi cordyceps and lion's
mane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a really nice balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm not promoting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, uh, I'm sure that there are other
people offering the same, same type of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, mixes and what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I get those mushrooms or when I do
get those mushrooms from China,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be more than happy to share those
spores with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even have an electric stir plate,
you know, for, uh, mixing the spores with
[SPEAKER_00]: the honey water and all that stuff or
inoculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we, uh, I, we emptied our house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've, you've seen that book about
how to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Marie Connery condo book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stripped this house clean furniture,
everything gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do the floors right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot less money if they're not
having to move furniture around.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of it, so part of it was an
economic consideration, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, since we've done that and I haven't
bothered to go get a lot of furniture,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of Nordic recliners.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not a minimalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not sitting here with the
Adirondack chairs from Walmart or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, but, uh, I just thought,
you know, owning a bunch of stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: really a downer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, is then you got to be, then you have
to be responsible for, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to maintain it and store it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell somebody about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, uh, I had a friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really brilliant in high school and
he got a scholarship and went to Harvard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, about a year after he
graduated at Harvard, he began a downward
[SPEAKER_00]: trajectory, alcohol and you know,
whatever other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember one time he said to me,
he goes, you know, the people are still
[SPEAKER_00]: really impressed that I went to Harvard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, yeah, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, uh, you know, write a book or
something, I guess, you know, my years at
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvard, uh, I, I don't know this,
uh, last year, uh, getting ready to fully
[SPEAKER_00]: retire and, you know, unloading the house
payment that was really liberated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, all I got to do is come up with
$300 a month for property taxes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, I paid more than that when I
got a high school, you know, rent,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 300 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I don't feel I need to,
other than toys, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: some, uh, there's another camera I want to
get, um, because I know I really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn just for my own pleasure,
I guess, is how to do video editing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: iPad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, there's, and there's a really
professional work being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying I'm going to compete with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, but just to see the challenge there
of mixing audio tracks and with the video
[SPEAKER_00]: that I shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, it's, you know,
it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot better than I got powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: In your case, I'd take a machete and take
it down and hope, you know, for better,
[SPEAKER_00]: like next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm glad, I'm glad you're doing
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I'm glad we got to talk about
mushrooms and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minimalism and, uh, cannabis a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we were doing this, I was just thinking
in my head, it'd be cool to come back on
[SPEAKER_01]: and not talk about how to grow a
psilocybin mushrooms necessarily,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to just talk about some of the effects
and usage and, um, some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences I think would be cool to share
in a separate interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're open to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I can really, I mean,
you know, my first experience with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, psilocybin was, let's see,
1968.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 51 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give it all away,
but I would like to say that, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the micro dosing became a really big part
of this transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would say in your life,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I started, uh, I went to see Paul
Stamets give us a talk in September from
[SPEAKER_00]: about nine months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, that was the one I sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from that, uh, presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought, I'm going to have to
give this a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started October 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what eight and a half months
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing that I can say is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When somebody asked me, well, what did it
do for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me was the biggest gift I
could have ever been given at this stage
[SPEAKER_00]: of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And had such knowledge been out there 10,
20 years ago, I would have, anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I don't sell things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, it matters not to me,
but I've just know that people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering from depression, long-term
hardcore depression that, uh, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: my daughter, for example, she died,
uh, after struggling for 12 years with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, she was diagnosed as, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, schizophrenic 12 years, you know,
it was a real tragedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wonder if that could have been
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, if we just get rid of this silly,
uh, social and political crap about how we
[SPEAKER_00]: treat different situations, one is that,
for example, end of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hard thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody to deal with, you know,
you're given a diagnosis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be, you know, tidy up your
affairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so research at John Hopkins and other
major research have found that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, administering the psychotropic,
uh, mushrooms help people make that bridge
[SPEAKER_00]: psychologically so that it isn't just
doom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can put things in perspective and why
wouldn't we want to do that for our,
[SPEAKER_00]: our friends, our parents or anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, why wouldn't we want that
available or at least research it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Research not, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to listen to dead or Jimmy
Hendrix, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, I guess that if I had a soap
box, that would be it that we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm involved with the group here in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get it on the ballot next
year, uh, not to legalize, not to even
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalize, just to allow a legitimate
research that has been done at Harvard and
[SPEAKER_00]: John Hopkins and universities in Asia and,
uh, Europe and what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we can bring the phrase I like
to use, you know, put some adults in
[SPEAKER_00]: charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have an agenda trying to
promote, you know, ABC mental health
[SPEAKER_00]: services or something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to call it, uh, Oh, stay bombed,
uh, pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought it would be a really good
name for a cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, but, uh, in a serious sense,
I mean, the way that we're treating our,
[SPEAKER_00]: our citizens and our, and our friends and
our family is, it's really horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I watched my daughter go through every
Prozac and I mean, I can't even name them
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just saw this downward, you know,
watching your child die over 12 years was,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, well, it's not something that I would
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would wish on my, I don't have enemies,
but I would wish on nobody that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, we have to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I don't, I don't have
the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a medical doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pretend to be, but what I do know is
that what we're doing isn't working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, how is your father?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, uh, he's semi retired now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's got a whole bunch of projects
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're having, they're out on the
Olympic peninsula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they actually had a whale wash up on
their beach, a gray whale this last,
[SPEAKER_00]: my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, seeing one of those in person was
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we went out there for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to, they were able to move it
fortunately because the thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, stunk like you would not believe as it
started posing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or that famous video from the sixties
when they blew one up on the Oregon beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I heard about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have been a slow news day,
but, uh, yeah, the, uh, we, we go to KTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for whale watching here in Oregon and
to see them moving north or south,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been a time of year, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty, uh, they're pretty incredible
creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to take away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, ideally it never would have washed
up on the beach, but since it did,
[SPEAKER_01]: we took the opportunity to actually get to
see it up close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I wanted to add this one,
one final thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the life I'm not trying to
get into, uh, anybody's religious beliefs,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, certainly not that, but if we
could agree that life came from the ocean
[SPEAKER_00]: and the form of plants, I think that's
what is so remarkable about kelp,
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp meal and its purest form,
like the form that you, uh, use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to pull it out of the ocean,
dry it in the sun and chop it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much benefit there,
not just the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a given, you know,
for, uh, agriculture and horticulture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, taking a capsule a day is
remarkable,
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the quality that we get,
uh, uh, Acadian sea plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, material.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming out of clean water,
cleaner water than I would want to
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily do the Pacific with all the
tankers and what have you moving across
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, I started taking kelp,
uh, caps just, uh, I'd have to reweigh it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's probably a little bit more than
maybe a little bit more than a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw it because I, when I got this
puppy from my good friend said it,
[SPEAKER_00]: forget it organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me this bulldog puppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went to this, uh, we'd be cool,
holistic, I love that term holistic pet
[SPEAKER_00]: center and they had kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm reading the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same variety that we use in our
soil mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at the price, it was $18 a
pound because it, it, they ground it
[SPEAKER_00]: finer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can live with it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started giving her a teaspoon in the
morning with her meals and then a teaspoon
[SPEAKER_00]: at night with her meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the puppies that came out of that
same, uh, litter, most of the puppies,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the gift giver to us sees those
puppies and he said, man, without a doubt,
[SPEAKER_00]: your dog is the biggest, the strongest,
healthiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so talking with a rep from ASL to
trade show one time, he said, look,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim, he says, you know, we love you guys,
but if people quit using it in their soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: we wouldn't even mention it at a
stockholders meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you guys are nothing,
uh, which is, you know, true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of kelp is used in
biomedicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: For human and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, you want stronger, whatever it
is, horses, dogs, livestock, kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: My chiropractor has draft horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got like 20 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about a weird hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, do you write them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't write graph horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, he's just beautiful to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, uh, we were talking one day and
yeah, and guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They, uh, part of their diet includes rock
desk and, uh, kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found that really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, uh, turned them on to using
concentrates because of the selection and
[SPEAKER_00]: quality price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got them off of a glacial rock
dust and over to a salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he, he was really impressed
with the changes that he saw in his,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, but anyway, so there's more in
commonality with plants and animals than
[SPEAKER_00]: we probably want to address or can
address.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I just find it
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started adding it to my mushroom
substrate, I went, wow, this is really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is like, and I want to get
back to you on that question because you
[SPEAKER_00]: asked a really legitimate question that I
cannot find a definitive answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we tweak the substrate and increase
whatever properties is that we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to a more meat-like flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say in a oyster mushroom,
can we manipulate that with the subs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you can grow it on newsprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just don't have the research on it
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm positive that it would change the
flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's, that's what happens
with all vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why the pathway is with
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, uh, something that,
uh, my friend and I have really been
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on is trying to bring some of the
practices that we've been doing for
[SPEAKER_00]: several years in the area of, uh,
soil mixes, which one of those can we
[SPEAKER_00]: bring over here to this and make,
uh, see a benefit, a viable benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I think that we, we are,
um, but, you know, it kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you already know, I don't want to sell
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to listen to, you know,
I just, uh, well, well, Jim, I gotta,
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta run for today so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we'll have to, we'll have to talk kelp
at some point, cause I got some stuff I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to share with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I'd love to talk to you
about some of these, uh, psychedelics and
[SPEAKER_01]: just, just trying to talk about
experiences and, and, and some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we'll do this again soon, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
Okay.
