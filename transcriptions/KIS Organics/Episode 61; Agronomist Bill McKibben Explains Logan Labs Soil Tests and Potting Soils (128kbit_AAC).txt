[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Kat Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biocontrols conference from last
podcast was a lot of fun and I met some
[SPEAKER_00]: great growers who attended the cannabis
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see more folks at future
biocontrols conferences and was grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: for the opportunity to speak on how to
evaluate commercial products when making
[SPEAKER_00]: production decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week's podcast relates to soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers and cannabis consultants
use soil tests to make fertility decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: for this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I learned in the last two weeks
really changed the way I view these tests
[SPEAKER_00]: and my conversation with our next guest
will hopefully explain in better detail
[SPEAKER_00]: how these tests work, what information on
them is most useful, and what we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: basing our production decisions on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week's guest is Bill McKibben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill is an accomplished agronomist and
author of two books relating to soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Art of Balancing Soil Nutrients and
The Grower's Guide to Balancing Soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been consulting on soil fertility
since 1976 and graduated in 1975 from The
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio State University with a master's of
science in soil chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a consultant to Logan Labs and the
owner of Soil Tech Incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to Bill in the past regarding
soil testing, but this latest conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: we focused on potting soils or highly
amended soils, what many of us in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry call super soil or living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Bill, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you coming on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to give listeners a little
background into how I ended up chatting
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually talked, we talked quite a
few years back, but this time around,
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael over at Maincraft Cannabis,
he's a good friend of mine, we were
[SPEAKER_00]: chatting and he had called and talked to
Susan, the lab director at Logan Labs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he called me up and he's like,
hey Tad, I was talking to Susan and she
[SPEAKER_00]: was saying that some of these numbers on
the Malik 3 test, which is your standard
[SPEAKER_00]: soil test, are not very usable when we're
doing these soil evaluations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had a conversation with her about
how much they're using in a sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: about the exchange capacity and what these
numbers look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they mean when we're talking
about potting soils versus, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: native soils or agricultural soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Bill, I just wanted to kind of talk
about, you know, a little bit about what
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these numbers mean on a soil
report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for listeners, I'm going to have a
Malik 3 and a saturated paste of our
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial growers mix on the podcast
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please go check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what Bill and I are going to be
working off of when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: different numbers so that we're all on the
same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all on the same page for looking at
the same test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bill, can you talk a little bit about
the Malik 3 test and what they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and how much material they're
using and just a little bit about that
[SPEAKER_00]: process before we start looking at
numbers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really work at Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the agronomist to Logan Labs,
but I'm pretty familiar with whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Susan and I talk almost daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the Malik 3 and we've had
this discussion that really, really the
[SPEAKER_01]: Malik 3 is designed for soil extraction,
not so much the modified mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call them MGMs, modified growing mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people call them soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've talked to people on the phone
that said when I said soilless mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, no, it's the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if it's modified with all this peat
and everything, core fiber, it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: not a soil, especially once you get these
organic matters up to above 25,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: This test was really not designed for that
kind of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Malik extraction is a pH of 2.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is fairly acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in these modified mixes where you're
adding lime, it can dissolve that lime and
[SPEAKER_01]: make it look like you've got a lot more
material, a lot more calcium on the
[SPEAKER_01]: standard test than maybe what's really
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I want to highlight
regarding these tests as well that you
[SPEAKER_00]: brought up is the original goal of these
tests was to, you know, you're using soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: so sand, silt and clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the amount of the
fractions of these different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very different, like you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, sort of the colloquial trade term
for a lot of the soils and what we make is
[SPEAKER_00]: called, a lot of people are calling them
living soils now, but you're right,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're soilless mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a living soil by this industry cannabis
standard is really what a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: are calling super soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a heavily amended soilless
mix that is then reused multiple cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to make sure we're all on
the same terms in terms of like
[SPEAKER_00]: nomenclature here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I like to point out
when you mentioned the sand, silt and
[SPEAKER_01]: clay, and that's really what the Malik
extraction was designed to do was to
[SPEAKER_01]: remove nutrients off of the colloids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, really, these modified mixes don't
have a lot of colloids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a bunch of minerals that's
floating around in an organic substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that again poses a problem for some
of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to come back to that when we
start talking about exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one question that I was wondering
about, regarding these tests, when you
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about these peat mixes or cocoa mixes
is all of these things have a purported
[SPEAKER_00]: cation exchange value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can go online and look up an
average compost or an average peat mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that translate when we're talking
about these Malik 3 tests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, see, this is where I think it's a
little bit fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that when you look at a soil and
you say, well, the organic matter is
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing to the exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a humus that's contributing
to the exchange capacity, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: than just the fact that it's organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm sure some people might disagree
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's kind of the way I look at it
is, again, I know that when we look at
[SPEAKER_01]: these organic matters in these modified
mixes and then the calculations done for
[SPEAKER_01]: ENR or the estimated nitrogen release,
those numbers are very dependable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, so I think that they might be
able to say that there's some exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity there, but I think it's very
minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're under the impression that these
things don't actually have the exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity that is purported to them when
you start looking online, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other question around this would be,
if that is the case, then what's keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: these?
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, when you're talking about
organic matter and humus and things
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down, well, humus is one of the
most controversial things in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: science field anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, the concept being that
organic matter is slowly breaking down all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this organic matter is breaking down
into something that eventually is
[SPEAKER_00]: undistinguishable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't tell if that original organic
matter was plant matter, a human foot,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever sort of organic matter you want
to think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now virtually indistinguishable on a
microscopic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has this excellent biological
capacity and also excellent cation
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange capacity or ability to hold on to
nutrients when we're talking about humus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, the higher your organic
matter, the more it's breaking down and
[SPEAKER_00]: the more you're building humus over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And traditionally, this takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of speculation on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound about right, or do you
have more that you'd want to add regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you're looking at it on
some sort of time scale, if you're taking
[SPEAKER_01]: a peat in there versus a humus that's
developed in the soil, there's a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in the time scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, maybe I shouldn't say that there's no
exchange capacity on a peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think as it continues to break down
and actually it's going to now make the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter kind of more concentrated
or get to the point where it is not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to break down any further, that's when I
think it has the maximum amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, peat is interesting because it is
harvested and it is traditionally
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's already fairly old,
relatively speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already organic matter that's been
breaking down in these bogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of speculation,
too, about how sustainable it is and how
[SPEAKER_00]: long it takes for peat to form is a whole
other topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to cocoa core, which is a
relatively fresh material relative to
[SPEAKER_00]: peat, it certainly seems like peat would
be breaking down towards humus or be a
[SPEAKER_00]: much more stable component when we talk
about its humic fraction relative to
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that's a fair comparison
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen peats where you can actually
see the sticks that are still in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, I think the quality of
peat, there's a whole scale of quality on
[SPEAKER_01]: peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not all peat is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though I will say one thing that Tim
Wilson discovered was that peat is not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily sterile either, like a lot of
people assume it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you throw it under the microscope,
there's quite a bit of biological activity
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in there, which from an organic
perspective is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before we dive into the TEC too much,
one thing I wanted to touch on is you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned free calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, when I mix my soil,
I'm putting in agricultural lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fairly fine mesh or grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost like flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in theory, if that's not been cycled
yet by the microbes, it could really skew
[SPEAKER_00]: these tests or show up as free calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, what typically what growers do
when they have calcerous soils is they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: do a fizz test with vinegar and then they
may get the AA 8.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that test
and how that's more accurate in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium before we get into the exchange
capacity stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, this is where you and I
probably will separate company here on
[SPEAKER_01]: this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The you know, I'm not a big fan of
adjusting the malloc or the monium acetate
[SPEAKER_01]: to 8.2 only because it's basically at 8.2,
8.3 is when calcium carbonate stops
[SPEAKER_01]: dissociating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're doing at 8.2, 8.3 pH
extraction, you're basically looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: what calcium in there that is not calcium
carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying that for some people
that might not be good information,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for me, I'm not concerned that much
with what is not calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'll show up things like
calcium chlorides, gypsums, those type of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's gonna leave the calcium carbonate
on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Applying this is a huge factor here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, at 8.2, it should just be
taking out calcium, showing up calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: that is not calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is when I look at the 8.2,
that is, if you're gonna use it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you use it for, I would think,
for just pure calcium, because I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: really underestimates magnesium and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not saying that there isn't some
value in it, but for me as a consultant,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a real big fan of using that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you find that, wow, I really get some
benefit from it, then that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't argue with success.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would just soon do the MELEC and the
PACE analysis and make my judgments from
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you know then if you're not
getting over reported calcium values on
[SPEAKER_00]: the MELEC test, on the standard soil test?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think when you run the MELEC,
it's gonna, unless you've got so much
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium in there that it neutralizes the
MELEC extraction solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is gonna be really, really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to dissolve that calcium and
that's gonna show up as part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, my concept of these
modified growing media is I've got these
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in there floating in the organic
substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the question is, okay, I can look
and I can tell you with the MELEC that the
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium we have in here is potentially
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I rely on the PACE to say,
do I have enough sitting out here in
[SPEAKER_01]: solution that will feed the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking for sufficiency values
on the PACE test?
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking for sufficiency levels?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to see a balance in the PACE,
but I also wanna see certain sufficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well let's save the PACE,
saturated PACE.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do wanna talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's, can we talk a little bit more
about the MELEC test, so the standard soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test in regards to how the lab processes
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was not aware until it was brought to
my attention that for the MELEC test,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really only using two milligrams
of material, sorry, two milliliters of
[SPEAKER_00]: volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're using a five mill scoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a five milliliter scoop now,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a relatively small amount when we're
talking about a potting soil that's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not homogeneously mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how you can make a
recommendation across 50 yards of soil off
[SPEAKER_00]: of five milliliters in theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the inherent problem in trying to
run a soil test on a modified MEX.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point in time, I don't know
how you get around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what happens is when you dissolve
that calcium, it's now picked up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: extracting solution, run through the ICP,
and it shows you maybe in a much higher
[SPEAKER_01]: TEC because of the calcium that it
dissolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the exchange capacity,
because a lot of the numbers on this test
[SPEAKER_00]: are based off of essentially whatever that
reported exchange capacity is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm hearing from the lab director,
Susan, and then from you too is that that
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange capacity is not a number that we
can trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could, well, not only do I wanna stay
quiet, I wanna hold that because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that exchange capacity when you're looking
at modified mixes are, I would not use it
[SPEAKER_01]: to determine desired values.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I think when you take the desired
values off of these things, because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the exchange capacity is used to
determine desired values.
[SPEAKER_01]: The values found, that's just reported
what it's found.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the desired value that comes in here,
that's based on the exchange capacity and
[SPEAKER_01]: setting these mixes up at 68% calcium,
12% base saturation and magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: and 4% potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have to have desired values,
well, then you better be aware that those
[SPEAKER_01]: can be over exaggerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would like to say that the exchange
capacity, I think probably be best if we
[SPEAKER_01]: would use that like we would at EC number.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, I think someplace between
maybe 10 and 16 exchange capacity,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get much above that 16 exchange
capacity, you're setting yourself up for
[SPEAKER_01]: some salts problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, and that's interesting because
we've seen, you and I talked about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: how there's quite a bit of variation that
you've seen on these tests and I've seen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've seen some pretty high salt levels
that still are very productive soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis soils and vegetable soils,
because we do have some growers using our
[SPEAKER_00]: soils with vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I want to talk about
definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of this idea of using
essentially a teaspoon of material as our
[SPEAKER_00]: basis for a soil test and then taking that
teaspoon and then calculating out an
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange capacity that really doesn't
represent it, because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants out there making
recommendations off of these tests using
[SPEAKER_00]: that exchange capacity and using these
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a lot of growers honestly
using these tests and saying that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, making their soil decisions
based off of these tests and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing, you know, how much just in a
broad sweep, do you feel like this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: tool that you use in evaluating a soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, there's, you know,
the physical properties of a soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the biological properties,
there's the chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about nutrient values,
where do you think these soil tests fall
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of like, how much can you really
trust them when you're making decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: about a soil mix like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: On a modified mix, I don't think you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't really think that,
I think that in a modified mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the desired values should be pulled
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should set your own
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficiency levels for these mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not try to have them set up on a base
saturation like you would a standard soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you look at these,
and you're right, I mean, there can be
[SPEAKER_01]: some big variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if you go to a bigger scoop,
I'm not sure that's gonna solve the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an inherent problem with the
test, if you've got a lot of chunk
[SPEAKER_01]: material in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people say, well, why don't you
grind those samples?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you're gonna grind some of
those minerals out and make them more
[SPEAKER_01]: available too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think the thing to do is
to realize that the TECs are not correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna continue to use them as an EC
number, but I think you should set up
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficiency levels of your calcium,
your magnesium, potassium, and go with
[SPEAKER_01]: those numbers and not try to let these
desired values determine how you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I typically see, if you go to,
for potassium, you know, if you get up
[SPEAKER_01]: there much over 4%, I see a lot of
potassium does not hold onto the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it just seems to pass right into
solubility, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you get up there much above
4%, then we start seeing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium in the paste test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how do you feel about trusting the
base saturation percentages as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: this test?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, I wouldn't be...
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not looking at those all
that much because I'm setting desired
[SPEAKER_01]: values.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I'm setting specific values
that I want using more of a slant approach
[SPEAKER_01]: than on all break balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you're saying I wanna see this
PPM for sulfur, phosphorus, calcium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've kind of set those values at
what you think is optimal for a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right, and then by looking at those
and say, okay, well, at least I have those
[SPEAKER_01]: showing up in the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then turn around, look at the paste
and see, well, are they moving into
[SPEAKER_01]: solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's a combination of
things, not just... I think if you use
[SPEAKER_01]: this soil test or any soil test like this
on a modified mix without using a paste,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I've been doing this now for five or
six years, trying to better understand
[SPEAKER_00]: these soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll admit, I have a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like a lot of what I was
understanding around them was frankly
[SPEAKER_00]: incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this has been really eye-opening for
me in the last couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've always struggled with using the
values found in terms of exchangeable
[SPEAKER_00]: cations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I've just been looking at base...
I've been skipping straight to base
[SPEAKER_00]: saturation percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trend I've seen is that,
for example, you mentioned potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see potassium drop below 5%,
I get grower-reported, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller buds in what appears to be
potassium deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other trend I noticed,
which makes a lot of sense because these
[SPEAKER_00]: are fairly weak ions, they move through
the soil faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium and nitrogen seem to be used up
by the plant or by people's watering
[SPEAKER_00]: habits, you know, much faster than any of
the other nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, typically when I re-amend,
I find I'm not adding... Like this mix
[SPEAKER_00]: right here that we're looking at,
I'll find that the calcium and magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: values will still stay fairly similar to
where they are now, but my potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: levels will drop quite a bit, as well as
my nitrogen levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with people that are watering with
nitrogen, there's literally no runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, those are the things that I've been
kind of keyed to looking at these tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd be curious what your thoughts are
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I think 8%, that seems high to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, when you look at these
numbers, you do have to look at them in
[SPEAKER_01]: comparison to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, when you're looking at this
test that we're looking at right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we found almost 2,200 pounds of
calcium, which is a double charge against
[SPEAKER_01]: 500 pounds of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there is something to be
said for the balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question might be, well, do we have
too much calcium in there that's blocking
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium uptake?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the soluble salts thing that you've
said you've seen some really good results
[SPEAKER_01]: with salts up to 2,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of intriguing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think you have to look at some
relationships here, but are we just too
[SPEAKER_01]: high in one?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at potassium,
again, it's not held, it moves into
[SPEAKER_01]: solution pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly potassium is one of those
nutrients that tends to be luxury
[SPEAKER_01]: consumed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm like you, there's a lot to learn
on this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when you're coming from a
soil to a soilless mix, the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships is even more critical
because there's no stability in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you talk about nutrient
relationships, you know, you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about essentially mineral balancing,
which was sort of founded by, started by
[SPEAKER_00]: William Albrecht, as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of people have gone off and
come up with different, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly different base saturation
percentages, but looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between all these minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, for me, the confusing part,
like when we talk about that, like
[SPEAKER_00]: Albrecht loves a 6812 relationship between
calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was sort of his level, if I remember
correctly, but some people like Tejans
[SPEAKER_00]: have gone upwards of 90%, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people like Arden Anderson will
say, you can't get enough gypsum in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they're all for a lot of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the big driver when we
talk about agricultural soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the actual numbers that
Albrecht settled on was 65 and 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was some later research
that said, well, you could go to 70 and 10
[SPEAKER_01]: and then 68 and 12 came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, getting into that
perspective there, I think is what you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to look at, not necessarily is it 65
or is it 68?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're trying to split hairs
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing is when you look at
this soil and you see that it's a malic
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction and it's dissolved stuff,
that's not, I mean, how do I want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's been dissolved,
but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: plant available at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, looking at these whole tests on
a modified mix, you have to be really
[SPEAKER_01]: careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how better to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, what I try and tell people is the
soil test is sort of it's a tool just like
[SPEAKER_00]: a rake or a shovel or any or a tractor or
anything else you might have in your
[SPEAKER_00]: repertoire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, we're not going for the
perfect soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going for plant health and plant
plant growth or yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, that's our
metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's not a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, how is our plant look and
what are we yielding off of this crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and that's why I say it is the pace
test becomes the main tool here,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that is that's a water extractable
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the plants are seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we talk a little bit about the pace
test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about what how a pace test is
is processed by the lab, what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and then what what these numbers
kind of kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they they tend they take the the
sample that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe they're used in some place
between two and four hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the lab uses two hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the original research would
use four hundred grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we're also striving for
consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as long as you it can stay
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but so the lab takes two hundred grams
versus maybe five grams that they would
[SPEAKER_01]: use for Melick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll take that two hundred grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they bring that up to kind of a
patent pancake batter consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they leave that set for 24 hours,
then they vacuum that water off and then
[SPEAKER_01]: run it through the ICP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like they run the extract solution on
the Melick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so once that soil has set for 24 hours,
they vacuum off and then then we're get
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how we're getting the data here for
the for the pace test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, soluble salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll use a meter in the in the mix
before it's vacuumed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then they'll measure measure the
bicarbs and the chlorides in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the data collected is pretty much
the same as on on the standard test,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the exception of bicarbs,
soluble salts and chlorides.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it's an all water soluble
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and when you when you look at some of
the data, I think it was Barbara and Olson
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're showing that most of the
nutrient uptake, with the exception of
[SPEAKER_01]: copper and about 50 percent of the iron is
is taken up by by mass flow and diffusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is nutrients in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept here is that the pace
saturated pace test is it's essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're taking the soil,
putting it in water that's fairly neutral
[SPEAKER_00]: and then just whatever seeps out
essentially into solution is is what shows
[SPEAKER_00]: up on the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is in theory what is plant
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not it's not a strong extraction
like we had with the standard,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an acid that's going to pull more
nutrients out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really just what's what's available to
the plant in theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the correlation they're going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're looking at the the DI
waters, what's what's typically used and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's right there close to seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you look at rainwater today,
it's about six six is what I've I've
[SPEAKER_01]: tested it at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly a lot higher than what it used
to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're looking at the DI water
extraction, it's very similar to what you
[SPEAKER_01]: would get with rainwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but we've also used we've had people
use their their water as the extracting
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can go you can go two
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lab will take your water and use it as
the extracting solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really interesting because
that's going to obviously give you
[SPEAKER_00]: different values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important that people
test their water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to highlight that because a
lot of times I'll see buildup of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things and like usually it's the pH will
continue to rise or sodium or calcium will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it is tied back to their
water when we start talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: successive cycles in this type of media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to encourage listeners
again to to please test their water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those values are really that's really
valuable information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me say one thing about the waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you that's not exactly what we
wanted to do today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that you can look at
a water test and you can say based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters that are out there is that
they'll say, well, that's a pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a as a soil guy, I want to know
what the effect of that water accumulation
[SPEAKER_01]: of nutrients will be on that soil after
four or five irrigation cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at the balance of the of
the nutrients in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: After four or five irrigation cycles,
there's a lot of times it will start to
[SPEAKER_01]: look your pace test will start to look
more like the water test than it than it
[SPEAKER_01]: did originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about, you know, I know we weren't
talking about water, but I think this is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of people having good
success by pH pHing their water down to
[SPEAKER_00]: six five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Michael at Maincraft Cannabis
claims that he got even better growth by
[SPEAKER_00]: going down to five five with his water
using phosphoric acid instead of citric
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts regarding,
you know, pH in your water like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think he's probably I think when
you get I think you're getting down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at five five, it's certainly in a
modified mix where you're not looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe the biological activity like you
would in a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you start getting down to
five five, in a standard soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you start shifting the biology
maybe in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I certainly have I see better,
better availability at five eight to six
[SPEAKER_01]: two on on the pH is then I do even at six
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, it's funny because most of our soils,
six eight is probably the lowest I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to be a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we're using a lot of peat moss
and due to the amount of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cations and alkaline alkaline
amendments that we're using because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: using biochar, which is fairly alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using, you know, compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding in a lot of cations and
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our soils tend to run more with more
alkaline than acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet they seem to perform pretty well
when we talk about, you know, plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant, a lot of organic growers say,
you know, you can throw away your pH pen
[SPEAKER_00]: or your pH meter, which I don't agree
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do see results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does appear to that we're getting
better results by phing the water down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the research I read is that you really
can't impact your overall media pH all
[SPEAKER_00]: that dramatically by by watering,
especially with something like citric acid
[SPEAKER_00]: that's such a weak has such a weak
buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how what's the what do you think the
ability of the water is to really lower
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH over time in your in your soil is
media?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think I think lower that pH down
to that six five or six two or wherever
[SPEAKER_01]: you want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, what you're trying to do is
you're mainly getting rid of bicarbonates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're burning off bicarbonates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which has a huge impact on calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the soils dry down,
it will precipitate out calcium and then
[SPEAKER_01]: that will precipitate out phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get that domino effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the the other thing about pH is when
you look at at some of these mixes and
[SPEAKER_01]: let's just take a look at the one here we
got in front of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, pH is six point eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when when we're measuring pH,
what are we measuring?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're measuring hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you start having these salts
up here this high, that tends to block the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of hydrogen ions that can get to
that to that sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're tending to dilute the hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have you could still have the same
amount of hydrogen ions, but because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the higher salts content in the water,
it tends to block that hydrogen through
[SPEAKER_01]: the through the meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, salts typically are they're
supposed to be pH neutral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can put a you put a potassium
chloride, a potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a strong acid, strong base.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not really supposed to change the
pH and they probably won't change the
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrogen ion concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm telling you that that we will see
increases in the pH just because of salts
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how concerning is that when we see a pH
that's, you know, above seven or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this is where you're getting a
little out of my comfort comfort zone here
[SPEAKER_00]: when you start talking about this testing
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you saying that this pH number may
or may not be completely accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying it can be you could actually
have it could be masked a little bit by
[SPEAKER_01]: the salt concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be in theory lower than it
actually shows on the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes more sense to me because you
look at a pH availability chart and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: try and put one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the podcast page as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that a lot of the
nutrients that we want for plant health
[SPEAKER_00]: are more available at lower pHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be careful there,
too, because we start getting too low and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to get into territory where
some of these heavy metals are more easily
[SPEAKER_00]: uptaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can get dangerous for people in
regards to the passing heavy metal testing
[SPEAKER_00]: with their soil mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ranges we're talking are plenty
high for aluminum and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really that's really,
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this pH number may not what you're
saying is it may report on these tests
[SPEAKER_00]: higher than it is in reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because of the salts, because of the
salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other thing is when you look at a
pH chart like you were talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: remember that that is a static
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can look at if you look at one of
those, you look at a calcium on pH at five
[SPEAKER_01]: and you say, oh, my calcium is not very
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can show you solubility tests that
there's plenty of calcium available.
[SPEAKER_01]: What what those pH tests are are saying
that if you're looking at a regular soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've got a this is a soil that's not
that hasn't been modified or changed very
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a pH of five, the odds are
very good that you've the calcium has been
[SPEAKER_01]: leached out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, but that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so those when you look at those charts,
remember that is that is look trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: say if this soil is is a virgin soil at pH
seven, well, the odds are there's more
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium or more magnesium or potassium,
there's more cations there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't necessarily mean just
because you have a pH of five,
[SPEAKER_01]: five or five, nine, that you don't have
enough calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when we used to look at rainwater
that was pH five, five, we saw when we got
[SPEAKER_01]: a rain, we got a real bump in the in the
crop response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at six, six, we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those those pH charts are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there that that is a a static static
environment that that that you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at in perspective on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my takeaway would be from this is that
when we look at these numbers to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to consider is our soil is not just
this nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all these different micro pores
of aerobic and anaerobic activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that just from the biology we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH is not the same across all of these
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of different interactions
going on, frankly, most of them we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: fully understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of like biological
pockets that are going to impact and
[SPEAKER_00]: change the pH right there in that in that
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this just gives us a general,
I think, idea of where we're at,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, it's not it doesn't mean
that certain nutrients are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: completely unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't totally use that chart,
it sounds like, as a way of evaluating a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, just just because you have a pH
of seven, seven five, you say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I'm not going to have a phosphorus
availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if that pH is seven five because of
sodium or potassium, both potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate and sodium phosphate are are
very soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, it's the factor that's causing
that pH to be high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, calcium there, when you talk about
some guys modifying their water with
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphoric acid, if you got much calcium
in there, that's going to be a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're going to precipitate that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would that necessarily be a bad
thing if the calcium precipitates,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we have too much of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I did that one time and we had a
well water that we put phosphoric acid in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the drip irrigation, it plugged
up the nozzles.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's the issue with precipitation
is that it could clog irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other issues in terms of the
soil itself over time with management?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you start, if you overdo it and you
get too much phosphorus in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, phosphorus really ties up
zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we look at the saturated paste test a
little bit closer and can you talk?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked a little bit about soluble
salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think those three things are really
confusing to to growers in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about soluble salts,
chloride and bicarbonate, those those
[SPEAKER_00]: three numbers right there, can you talk a
little bit about what those are and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of evaluate them in your eyes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, soluble salts, when I talk to a lot
of people, they're saying, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think my sodium is that high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The salt is all the cations and anions
combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's you know, that's ammonia,
that's nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sulfur, calcium, magnesium,
potassium, phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things are thrown into the
soluble salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's what happens is
when the soluble salts get too high,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it causes the plants to have to
expend energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They better have better phosphorus numbers
if the salts are high because that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: has to expend energy to pull water in
where the tendency is if the concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: of salts are higher on the outside of the
root, then it wants to pull fresh water
[SPEAKER_01]: back away from the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the and plants in general, they have a
wide range in which they can operate in
[SPEAKER_01]: the in the salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I look at it, I really don't
like to have salts over over 1200.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're you're saying that you're very
successful at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not going to disagree that you
may.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I look at these numbers here and I
think, you know, to me, these numbers are
[SPEAKER_01]: on the high side, but you're successful at
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think one of the other things,
too, and we're talking about soluble salts
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've had guys I've seen numbers three
thousand, four thousand, five thousand on
[SPEAKER_00]: these that they claim they still have
good, healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what what I would say is, like you
mentioned regarding water, we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about pretty intensive cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically they're CO2 supplementation,
very high light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of nutrient uptake going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the big thing there, like you
mentioned with water is irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using an irrigation system that keeps
water levels fairly high relative to what
[SPEAKER_00]: you would see traditionally outside,
you know, to where they're either
[SPEAKER_00]: continually receiving water, like using
these blue mat systems that we use or
[SPEAKER_00]: people are watering every two to three
days to keep that soil evenly moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the the combination of high
nutrient uptake and biological activity
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of offsets some of these soluble salt
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think you're I think you're exactly
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salt's become a problem when when the
soils tend to dry down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and so because the salt concentration
gets higher as the soils dry down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this this sixteen hundred if you let it
go dry, might might go up to three
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so that's so keeping keeping your,
you know, in the water you're injecting
[SPEAKER_01]: into this thing is, you know, maybe it's
got a soluble salts of two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you're running that dilution
down all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're adding water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you let if you let it go dry,
then then the concentration really gets to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and the peat so hydrophobic anyway,
that causes an issue with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: potting soils, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lose lose when we talk about
letting these soils dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will also tell you that I think that
you can get your salts numbers too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the salts are going to be an
indication of nutrient concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your salts get down there,
probably less than five hundred or four
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred, you might have not have enough
nutrients in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, too, the other thing to keep
in mind is with these soils, the original
[SPEAKER_00]: concept was that we were doing a one time
fertigation right at the beginning when we
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed the soil so that people could
literally just water their plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: not continually adding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to have higher salt levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's we could we could debate
about whether or not this is too much or
[SPEAKER_00]: what a maximum amount of you know,
soluble nutrients or soluble salt levels
[SPEAKER_00]: is appropriate in a potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you're trying to go a
full cycle, they are going to have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: higher than, say, someone who's applying
fertilizer, you know, every watering or
[SPEAKER_00]: weekly or whatever application schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I think in virtually all these
cases that you're dealing with or with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, those are all transplants that
you're putting in there, starting seeds in
[SPEAKER_01]: these kind of salt levels could be a real
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have people that start seeds in these
soils, but it's not what I would typically
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to work OK, they claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that doesn't make sense to my
brain either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, some of those depending on the
seeds, you know, I think cucumbers or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, you know,
they're not going to take they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to take high salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe a tomato will or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a real variability on the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have to I'm like, I can't tell
you that exactly what it is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do that very significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little about chloride next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's something I'm not very
strong on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would love a little education on on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, now we got both two people
that aren't very strong on chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that can be a chloride
certainly has a toxicity, a lower toxicity
[SPEAKER_01]: level, much the same maybe as boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's a matter of trying to
keep that chlorides, chlorides down
[SPEAKER_01]: because the toxicity, where is that
toxicity at?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question because of all
these other things that that's entering
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it might be it might be a
two fifty three hundred toxicity range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just where, you know,
what's the toxicity range for soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: salts?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it might go from it might be up
there to two to three thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot narrower on chlorides than
than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, really, bicarbonates are is a
fairly narrow range, too, because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: of the precipitating effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where where are we picking up chloride
typically in these mixes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, chlorides, chlorides are in a lot of
things when you look at I'm sure there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: fair amount of chlorides in peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at standard soils,
you know, there's there's a fair amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorides there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't measure them a lot like
we do in these mixes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that's the that's one of
the anions that that balances the cations
[SPEAKER_01]: coming into the to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, nitrate would do that,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But chlorides, if you look on tissue,
sometimes the chlorides are extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the balancing cation or
anion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we picking it up from our water source
ever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, certainly we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and then moving on to bicarbonate,
you mentioned that's a narrow window.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of it coming in on water
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we manage bicarbonate levels and
what is that number?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the concern with bicarbonates in
terms of toxicity or chloride,
[SPEAKER_00]: really, too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, bicarbonates, the worry is
you get it so high that, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: as the soils dry down, they start
precipitating out calcium and then that
[SPEAKER_01]: domino effect of precipitating out
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it becomes less of a problem the more
you keep the moisture there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't let it go dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's mainly and how you handle this is
just by acidifying that water so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can burn off those bicarbonates as carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so we can lower it by applying
somewhat slightly acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water solution to it.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what we're seeing when we see like
on the edges of fabric pots, we'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: like a crustiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or on the top of the soil, you'll see that
white crustiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that just the precipitate of some of
these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably what's precipitating out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the salt that's precipitating out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would tend to think because we tend
to have a lot more calcium out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And calcium will precipitate out
relatively easy as opposed to,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's either calcium, magnesium
precipitate.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we talk a little bit about these
numbers moving down the saturated paste
[SPEAKER_00]: report?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just touch briefly on each of
these major anions and cations?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I want to for listeners,
anions are going to lower your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cations are going to raise your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just something that I just wanted
to throw out there since we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about these things kind of as a general
rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so where would I like to see these?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the calcium?
[SPEAKER_01]: And calcium is going to affect root
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got to be at the root tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to get root development,
you can't take calcium out of the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And move it down to the roots at the
bottom of the pot if it's not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So calcium is a huge factor in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the numbers exactly?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it should be less than 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how high it should be, that's a good
question, especially if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do this with just a watering regime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have to be higher than 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think a range is fine because one
of the things I'd like to highlight is we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really know what's optimal for this
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the research isn't out there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you and I have talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot we're learning about
what's best practice for cannabis because
[SPEAKER_00]: it isn't as well studied of a crop.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at 100, one of the things
we don't know between the standard test
[SPEAKER_01]: and a paste is we don't know what the flow
rate is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what the flow rate of
calcium is in the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could maintain 100, I think 100
would be plenty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the flow rate isn't there,
if we don't have calcium in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: fineness or the right type of calcium that
will continually flow and feed the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we're going to have to have a higher
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's really hard to
determine exactly where.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a better feeling saying that you'll
have problems in general crops if you get
[SPEAKER_01]: down to 10 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cannabis, probably you start getting
down to 30, 40 parts per million,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get into trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 30, 40 parts per million is great
on a soil in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a growing hemp in a field,
if you could get 30, 40, that'd probably
[SPEAKER_01]: be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just really hard to nail down a
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 100, 150, providing that you're
going to have a flow rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally speaking, if we're watering
with well water, we're going to always
[SPEAKER_01]: have some calcium there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on what the water quality is
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing is having enough
calcium is not only important for root
[SPEAKER_01]: development, but it's important for cell
wall integrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in these enclosures where you
can tend to get high humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't get calcium in that cell
wall, you're opening yourself up for
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildews and disease problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well the traditional response to any
plant or leaf deficiency was always add
[SPEAKER_00]: some more calmeg, which is higher in
magnesium relative to its calcium levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's what people were trying
to address with these liquid bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially what I'm hearing you say
regarding these things is really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're starting with calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're looking to make sure that
it doesn't matter if there's 2000,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 2200 PPM of calcium found in our
soil if that is not becoming available
[SPEAKER_00]: when we do this saturated paste test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do start with calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what I like to do is run
magnesium about five to one, or the
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium five to one magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in this case here, if I really
wanted a balance in the solution where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have 61 magnesium, I would need about 300
of the calcium to stay at that five to one
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I tell people that's what you want to
do, but then you've got to watch how high
[SPEAKER_01]: you push the high salts when you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I could get the potassium twice the
magnesium and the magnesium one fifth of
[SPEAKER_01]: the calcium, then I feel like I've got a
pretty good ratio or balance in the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a limitation of how you just
can't keep adding one to balance out the
[SPEAKER_01]: other because of the salt problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's going to raise your pH as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And magnesium, as I understand,
raises your pH one and a half times of
[SPEAKER_00]: what calcium does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be really careful when you
start adding magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in traditional soils, it tightens the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we're seeing that so much
with potting soils to be an issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that in theory is what people say is
magnesium tightens your soil and calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: floccates or loosens your soils in terms
of the tilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these in this situation, I don't think
that applies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this really doesn't apply very.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the reason why Albrecht looked at
the calcium magnesium ratios was to
[SPEAKER_01]: because it has an impact on soil physics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't really have soil in
modified mixes or in sands for that
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get into sands, you don't
have the compaction because of a clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can have compaction because of
the fineness of the sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the magnesium in a lot of sands,
I will I will push up to 20 percent where
[SPEAKER_01]: in a heavy clay, that might be way too
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so, yeah, it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the magnesium, of course, if you add
magnesium as magnesium sulfate or epsom
[SPEAKER_01]: salts, that is a strong acid, strong base,
and that's not going to change your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except when you if you get the salts too
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I just want to highlight is
it's much easier to add than it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important for people to
keep in mind that less is more in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to take that potassium
out of there once it's in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that applies almost more to
phosphorus, because I've seen PPMs over
[SPEAKER_00]: over six thousand when we're talking about
phosphorus on the Malik test.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, what issues do we have
besides a waste of money and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: leaching phosphates into our water supply
from a plant health perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: What issues does that create?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how much available phosphorus do we
want to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you correlate those numbers
when we're talking phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're if you're looking at the the
phosphorus on the pace test, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think two, two and a half parts per
million should be enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, as you as you push them up
higher, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really see so much problem with
phosphorus other than the fact that then
[SPEAKER_01]: zinc just drops out of the picture in the
tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the leaf tissue analysis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That because this is one of the challenges
of cannabis is it's really hard to get
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf tissue analysis done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you do get leaf tissue
analysis done, most people aren't sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's really hard to find accurate
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have heard of heard a lot about the
phosphorus zinc relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were looking at these numbers,
you just said we have sufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, but possibly excessive
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that excessive in terms of in relation
to our zinc numbers down below there that
[SPEAKER_00]: are at point zero three PPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that number low because the phosphorus
is so high?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could you relate back to the the
standard soil test where it shows six
[SPEAKER_00]: point eight nine PPM of zinc?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you kind of like correlate
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you look at six point nine and
and some of the some of the data you see
[SPEAKER_01]: out here from tri-state data and stuff,
which is mainly set up for soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll say, oh, six point nine is high is
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet at one hundred thirty two parts
per million phosphorus out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: I say you've got to run your zinc in a
relationship to your phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, if your phosphorus is
high, you have to have your zinc high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where that where that number should
be, I can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except that that I really don't believe
that six point nine is high enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at one hundred thirty two parts
per million, you know, that zinc could
[SPEAKER_01]: could very easily have to be up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty, thirty parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is all stuff that I want to
start playing around with as we learn more
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing some more controlled research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really hard to find this
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other challenge is like we're
not seeing any sort of zinc deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the facilities that we work with,
you know, in terms of leaf expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet I do wonder if we play around with
these numbers, if we would see some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of improvement in an overall growth due to
the increased zinc uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unless you're seeing it and not all
not all of these will display necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: as a leaf deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still stress a plant without
actually seeing it appear in the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue, which I think people is important
to emphasize, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's that thing they call
hidden hunger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I think, you know, zinc's a big
player in new growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tend to we tend to sample maybe older
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, bud growth, I think it will
have would be more impacted by by zinc
[SPEAKER_01]: than maybe maybe the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think regarding foliar
applications of some of these different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sulfates or even chelated
versions like that are organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we use the bio men products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're familiar with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in my experience, when I have
worked with growers that have gone really
[SPEAKER_00]: far down the rabbit hole with these trace
elements and trying to balance everything
[SPEAKER_00]: out using these soil tests, typically
their crop goes downhill, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so I haven't really messed with
these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, I don't want to add some of
these sulfates to because we want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: our soil organic and allow growers,
you know, you could say there's reported
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency now on the soil test if they
want to add zinc sulfate at a certain rate
[SPEAKER_00]: and experiment with it by all means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wonder, I guess I'm asking two
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, how how much trouble can you get in
playing around with these trace elements?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two, what do you think about
foliar applications, either of sulfates
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, chelated versions of the
these using humic acids or or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bio men sort of products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would I much prefer the EDTA
chelated traces.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some if you do sulfates,
you got to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably have less of a chance of burn
on metals as much as but you will have
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a chance of a burn for a sulfate
burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that that becomes the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get these soils and they're
so rich in in phosphates and the cations,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really worry too much about boron
because being an anion that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: impacted by the cations so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, calcium borate is very insoluble,
but boron just seems to be pretty much OK
[SPEAKER_01]: in a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but copper and zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've run probably almost 100
percent deficient in copper, and I
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly, you know, would not like to
just build these soils up with too much
[SPEAKER_01]: copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used to think that 20 parts per
million copper was toxic until I went and
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at some grapes in Portugal and they
had 300 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, copper is really bound up by
organic fractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one of the reasons why
we don't see much copper in these pace
[SPEAKER_01]: tests and why we probably should be
looking at at doing more more in the in
[SPEAKER_01]: the foliar feeding with chelates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one thing I do know that that zinc,
there is a there's kind of a response time
[SPEAKER_01]: here like zinc is more zinc likes the
plants like zinc much earlier than,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I get some work on on some of the
agricultural crops, spraying with zinc
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me early on, very early gave me
better results than if I waited,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can wait with manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, coming in with a spray
program with the chelates, I think you can
[SPEAKER_01]: put together a program, spray them every
10 to 14 days and and just cover a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: your bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you said you prefer chelates with
EDTA, chelate to EDTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to use products that are either
organic or allowed in organic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's a sort of a tricky
minefield when it comes to that subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are your recommendations there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you start going organic,
you know, there's certainly EDTAs are
[SPEAKER_01]: thrown out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at, you know, I think
sulfates about ends up being about the
[SPEAKER_01]: only thing you option you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know of anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the biomin products are approved for
use in organic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember exactly what the chelator
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all it's all a little bit
bureaucratic in terms of what's allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's not allowed in terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as clear as it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember exactly what they're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, they just they found a
workaround in terms of organic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't feel like it was necessarily
100 percent or, you know, any more
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're talking about the sulfates
to like you look at Megan, the sulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's this little pink ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously been, you know,
fairly highly processed by humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder, too, about if we, you know,
if we took some of these sulfates and used
[SPEAKER_00]: a chelator like humic acid, would that
allow us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a chemistry person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something we could apply as a
foliar application as a way of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: these nutrients on there in a semi or
quasi organic fashion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, humic acid has been,
you know, they probably use potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxide to extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not 100 percent organic either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the same as using like fish
hydrolysate or, you know, seaweed extract
[SPEAKER_00]: powder, these other these other things
that have some allowance for chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think any time you're using the
sulfates, using a real high quality fulvic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid is to your advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I've seen data that says we really
don't want more than five pounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate, a combination of sulfated traces,
more than five pounds per hundred gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of sulfated minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had to say you put a three
pounds of zinc sulfate, a pound of
[SPEAKER_01]: manganese sulfate, a pound of copper
sulfate, you're at the limit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, in a water solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm not sure that that under
those growing conditions, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: for pity sakes, always spray one or two
plants, you know, beforehand so you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: get into trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think putting putting the fulvic
acid in is is a real beneficial thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: get get those nutrients in and moving in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that brings up a whole nother
challenge, though, with labeling issues
[SPEAKER_00]: around fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's there's only one
commercially available purely fulvic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I'm aware of that's marketed as such
from BioEgg.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know we work with other humic acid
producers that claim to have fairly high
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of fulvic acid in their products,
but they're not able to put them on the
[SPEAKER_00]: label based on the way that they register
their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all a little bit confusing in
terms of what you're actually getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I know that NewTek has an Omri
approved what they call connectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a real high grade fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to look into that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just basically, you know, I I
appreciate you covering a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: this in terms of the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want to go over some of the
major takeaways from today and from our
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation in terms of these soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like we need to be careful
when we're looking at or evaluating these
[SPEAKER_00]: tests based on the way the tests are
taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be your major takeaways for
people in terms of the the male test,
[SPEAKER_00]: the saturated paste report?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to encourage users to still get
soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's certainly an air of caution in
terms of how we're consulting and
[SPEAKER_00]: recommending off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can make all kinds of criticisms
about, you know, whether we're using five
[SPEAKER_01]: five mil scoops or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other the other thing that comes
down to is how well are the growers mixing
[SPEAKER_01]: the product, mixing that sample and how
well are they sampling it if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling it during the growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are you taking a probe and
probing down through there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just taking some off the sides off the
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you really need to get a good,
thorough representative sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I think, you know,
needs to be addressed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of room for error in this
whole process, either on the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we got to take that into account
when we're looking at these tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't necessarily freak out when I
see a test that looks less than what
[SPEAKER_00]: people would consider to be optimal or
doesn't look perfectly balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always want to start with, how does your
plant look?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did your crop finish?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can't argue with success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that plant is successful,
then you're not doing all that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one last question I have, you know,
this is really confusing stuff for most
[SPEAKER_00]: people, myself included.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm trying to look at the
standard tests, the saturated paste tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, obviously other tests
like in methods, you know, like like Bray
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of those others.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we take these numbers and then come
up with any sort of like quantifiable
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding or recommendation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming that these numbers aren't
necessarily the end all be all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hear some consultants that are
so confident regarding their
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations around these numbers for
crops without ever really seeing the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how are we how can we really do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can we even do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, it goes back to how the
crop is responding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you look at these numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, OK, these numbers don't reflect what
what the water quality is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't reflect what the lighting
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've got to you've got to look
at this thing in a holistic fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is a part of this is a part
of the the tools that you have to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you if you you've got to understand
and really pay attention to what your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are saying back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't take into account the
biological activity of the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is cycling these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the things
that's really helped us with our soils is
[SPEAKER_00]: I and that's something I look at under the
microscope and have a better grasp of is
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of what's going on biologically in
these soils, because that's that's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately making a lot of these nutrients
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I have seen
more problems with is people that's
[SPEAKER_01]: recycling the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: What seems to be happening is more and
more nutrients are coming out during the
[SPEAKER_01]: first grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by time they get into the second
grow and then they they want to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: add their their normal fertility to that,
they're running into a salts problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want we almost need to look at every
growing situation as its own separate
[SPEAKER_00]: entity and then take a look at all of
these variables together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess for me, and I don't feel
confident making a lot of like
[SPEAKER_00]: quantifiable recommendations, but I can
look at a trend and say, hey, we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: the calcium is kind of staying where it's
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not add any more this cycle or we
added more potassium at this rate and we
[SPEAKER_00]: got this response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something we could up or we
could lower or maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I've been sort of been
doing been doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've I've been racking my brain for
years on trying to find a better way of
[SPEAKER_00]: quantifying things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't come up with it yet,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, as much and I've worked in
a standard soil for a long time and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: still not somebody tells you they got all
the answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just haven't been asked all the
questions because it's certainly it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an easy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll I'll definitely keep that in mind
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope growers will continue to test,
but just test with a grain of salt and
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that you need to look at this test
in the environment of humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, watering habits, biological
activity, all the things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned there need to come into play to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I really appreciate your time today,
Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was really enlightening for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that growers will reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about your role
in relation to Logan and what sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting you're doing on on these tests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm some I'm probably at a bigger
disadvantage than you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I as the consultant to agronomist to
Logan, if you if they request for me to
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluate the the the analysis,
it'll come to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I'll I'll write something up and
and send it back to the Logan and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll forward it on back to the client.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, and but again, I am at a
disadvantage because I don't see a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: those facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do have guys send me pictures and I
look at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but again, it's not like being there
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've been fairly successful in
helping people that that's in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sooner PC people do more testing
and try to stay out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I'm independent of Logan,
but you can either run it through Logan or
[SPEAKER_01]: they could contact me directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll put your information on the
website page.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people, if they ask for a
recommendation from Logan based on their
[SPEAKER_00]: test result, because what they'll get back
is literally just the sole report that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to put on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want a recommendation off of it,
then you're the one you're the guy that's
[SPEAKER_00]: who's making that recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: The buck stops here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're you're being transparent when
you say there's still a lot to learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: this crop and there's still a lot that you
want to learn personally regarding these
[SPEAKER_00]: tests and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people need to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I think that's every honest
consultant out there at this point in
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of consultants have been
basing their recommendations off of like
[SPEAKER_00]: you and I talked about today about numbers
that may not tell the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the big takeaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I had a guy I presented down
at Dallas and then I have a guy come in
[SPEAKER_01]: from California who says, well,
we run tissues every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I I thought, wow, you know,
that's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even make the correction within a
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got the results back and then you
made an application, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: retesting that with the material on the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people really go into extreme
details.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm more excess driven and saying,
well, you know, how's the plant look?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to I like to know the plants are
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're green.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're they're growing and and we're not
having burnt edges on the leaves or what
[SPEAKER_01]: have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and I'm hoping that you and I can
stay in better touch here moving forward
[SPEAKER_00]: to to improve this process, along with
other people that are that are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: similar things in this industry so that we
can all learn to make better
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I was going to say you
could look at a test like this and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, wow, here's something to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would watch the soluble salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could potentially be the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's ranges that we can
work at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at I'm I'm hoping to work with Logan
and maybe you did to put together a a
[SPEAKER_01]: little ring binder folder or ring binder
thing about these soils and what what we
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of project these numbers maybe should
be or should get into these ranges and and
[SPEAKER_01]: try to try to narrow them down for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hopefully do that by the end of
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Erica Reinheimer has been doing a
lot of work around this to coming working
[SPEAKER_00]: on a calculator around cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to mention her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been someone that I've really
enjoyed chatting with on this subject,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, Bill, for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to staying in touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the to the listeners who who
