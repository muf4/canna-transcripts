[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're enjoying these podcasts so far,
please take a moment to subscribe on
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes or Stitcher or whatever platform
you're listening on and leave me a rating
[SPEAKER_00]: and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really helpful and allows me to
keep producing good content by drawing
[SPEAKER_00]: more of the top names in the industry to
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sign up for our newsletters on our
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be releasing a compost tea
white paper and a bunch of new content
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the next few weeks and it's the
best way to find out right away when new
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part three in our series with Jim
Bennett, also known as Clackamas Coot on
[SPEAKER_00]: such forums as IC Mag and Lumper Dogs on
Grass City.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an organic grower and gardener who
has helped many people in improving the
[SPEAKER_00]: way they garden and move away from bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before we get into the interview with
Coot, I wanted to take a moment to address
[SPEAKER_00]: something I've been hearing about for the
past month or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some self-proclaimed cannabis
consultants out there that worked with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingham and have a series of biological
tests where they applied a neem seed meal
[SPEAKER_00]: or neem cake tea to the soil and they
claim it affected the bacterial to fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio of the soil in a negative manner,
allowing an increase in disease-causing
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also claim it kills beneficial fungi
and nematodes while increasing ciliates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard growers are literally throwing
out their soil over this and to me that is
[SPEAKER_00]: just crazy and I wanted to address it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I would say in response and
then I'll have Coot comment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I've done microscope testing on
neem cake and aerated compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That information is freely available on
YouTube and I've added it right on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast page so anyone can take a look for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person in question did not use a high
quality neem cake for the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products that we use and carry are of
the highest quality and we did a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: research before bringing them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never recommend making an anaerobic tea
with neem and kelp in full power.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ways we recommend using neem cake is
to add it to your worm bin, mix it into
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil mix or aerate it and use it as a
soil drench to combat fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anaerobic teas are always going to be high
in bacteria and ciliates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's common knowledge in the compost tea
industry and why we maintain dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen and aerated compost teas above six
milligrams per liter for the entire brew
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tests are only from one individual
and have not been replicated by anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on this fact alone, I wouldn't draw
any conclusions and the fact he is having
[SPEAKER_00]: people throw out perfectly good soil and
attempt to make neem into this
[SPEAKER_00]: catastrophic soil amendment is just
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this individual is just trying
to make a name for themselves so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: get consulting work by attacking someone
like Coot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even isolate for a controlling
variable, meaning they mix neem cake,
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp and fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on that, one could just as easily
conclude that it was the kelp or the
[SPEAKER_00]: fulvic acid or something else caused by
the combination of ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way you conclude that neem had
a negative effect based on that alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because someone shows you a soil
test or a lab test doesn't mean that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: real science.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first heard about this because
people were sending me messages on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, I went over to the guy's page
and took a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted my YouTube microscope link as a
way of sharing more information and to
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully start a discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I was really interested in
seeing if his claims were true and
[SPEAKER_00]: learning more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, he promptly blocked me and
deleted my posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in private messages, he told me I'm
just a bizarre old man and to go hassle
[SPEAKER_00]: other kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, first off, I don't think I'm that
old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yes, I do turn 40 in a couple of
weeks and my knees are starting to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like they belong on a 60 year old,
but in all seriousness, no legitimate
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher would delete data or not
welcome an open discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it really telling that he was more
interested in controlling the dialogue
[SPEAKER_00]: around the discussion and neem than
actually working together towards a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater understanding, which is what
science is really all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I'm concerned, based on what
I've read so far, I'm throwing this into
[SPEAKER_00]: the category of fake news as the
politicians or media might say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, at least until we can get more
data to support anything he is saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that neem has been used for
literally thousands of years by farmers as
[SPEAKER_00]: a means of improving their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I see here are some lab tests with no
controlling variable, a low sample size,
[SPEAKER_00]: poorly sourced inputs to which this
so-called consultant has drawn conclusions
[SPEAKER_00]: that just aren't proven and go against all
the other existing research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, let's not forget that the plant
can control the microbial population in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere based on the exudates it
puts out and cannabis appears to prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial soils like other annual crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've talked enough, let's get Coote on
here and see what he has to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you a lot, Ted, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't read the gentleman because he
blocked me several months ago because he
[SPEAKER_01]: did a bogus test on the so-called Coote's
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: The science out of that individual for me
is incomplete and generally inflammatory
[SPEAKER_01]: and again trying to promote some kind of
an agenda for consulting work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me clarify one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The neem tree as a part of human health
goes back at least 12,000 years and all
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the tree are used.
[SPEAKER_01]: In different ways, of course, the bark,
the leaves, the berries and the roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then of course the oil and meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a crop amendment, it picks up at about
8,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the 90s, you remember this,
I mean, at least reading about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: W.
R.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grace tried to grab control of the
international neem market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it isn't just India that produces neem
oil and meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the case went all the way to the world
court at The Hague.
[SPEAKER_01]: After spending $800 million because of the
work of Dr. Vedanta Shiva, which you know
[SPEAKER_01]: is behind the movie titled Dirt,
she's the one that led the cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: And W.
R.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grace wasn't successful, I'll leave it at
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read two, these are academic books,
Neem Atreides, which is four PhDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the actual authors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, they reference a body of work
that goes back to the 1800s as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the big one is the neem tree,
which was, I can't even try to pronounce
[SPEAKER_01]: his word, it's German.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he arrived in the Sudan after
graduating from Cologne University as an
[SPEAKER_01]: entomologist because there was a locust
disaster going on in the Sudan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when he arrived, he noticed that
the neem trees weren't affected by the
[SPEAKER_01]: locusts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he spent the next 35 years studying
neem, finishing up in 1993, and then put
[SPEAKER_01]: his research together in this book,
The Neem Tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also references over 500 scientists
and 200 research institution, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: something like 20 governments and their
body of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back, like I said, to the 1800s and
then more recent research that he and
[SPEAKER_01]: other contemporaries were involved at a
number of institutions and research
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The neem tree is found in over 72% of
Ayurvedic preparations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that, I really don't have much more
to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, any of us who have used neem,
and I'm probably one of the original in
[SPEAKER_01]: this discussion going back at least,
what, 12 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you and I met, I was already
firmly established using meal and oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: then picked up Karanja around the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've seen my work online and in
private photos that I've sent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there's something missing
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Jim, I mean, your plants always look
really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And haven't you also been in contact with
a lot of other growers over the years who
[SPEAKER_00]: have been using neem as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would even venture to say,
well, I'll just leave it at hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, enough on that subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back into our interview with
Clackamas Coot, talking about seaweed and
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to really know about kelp,
Dr. Michael Geary, G-U-I-R-Y, who's a
[SPEAKER_01]: Irish, see, consider one of the leading
experts in the world on marine algae.
[SPEAKER_01]: His website is seaweed.ie, which is
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you hit the nutrition tab on the
menu, he compares the three types of
[SPEAKER_01]: marine algae.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's red, green, and brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one we want is brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned the one that comes out of
the North Atlantic on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as harvested, and I wouldn't use
it because of the sheer amount of traffic,
[SPEAKER_01]: the shipping lanes out of Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Laminaridigitala, bladder wrack,
if you will, the ones that create the kelp
[SPEAKER_01]: forest that are really critical to marine
mammals in young row, hiding places from
[SPEAKER_01]: being eaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brown kelp produces some compounds that
are not found in any other plant on this
[SPEAKER_01]: earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big one is alginic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within the last 48 hours, you've
probably taken some form of alginic acid
[SPEAKER_01]: at least five different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a whole other reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fascinating how alginic acid
is used.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are compounds that you can't
replace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can replace nitrogen a number of
ways, like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got comfrey, you got alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of things that have
uber levels of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But things like alginic acid and phukodian
and some other compounds, those only
[SPEAKER_01]: exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the side-by-side
comparison of the three varieties of
[SPEAKER_01]: marine algae, or groups, I don't know,
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red, green, and brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brown's the one we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the red one is the one that has the
collagen that's used as a thickening
[SPEAKER_01]: agent, as you discovered on the rooting
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one, I don't know that we'd want
to use that in our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And green, well, you can see for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The side-by-side is really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some incredible photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's written three or four books on
marine algaes around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody really wanted to learn
about kelp, that would be a good resource
[SPEAKER_01]: without buying a book, because the library
repository is extensive and complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jim, just to change directions really
quick, I would love to have you back on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I wanted to, I thought
listeners might really enjoy, would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of your history in regards to
the one and that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anyone's actually heard
you tell that in an audio version.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was not, okay, the one came
about, it was a stupid, it was a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: There came a time that I needed money.
[SPEAKER_01]: The indoor thing was just really getting
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I lived in Laguna Beach for many
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the heydays of the Brotherhood of
Eternal Love, what Nixon called the hippie
[SPEAKER_01]: mafia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were responsible for bringing in
tonnage that you probably, or your
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners wouldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is one of those times where
government officials probably told the
[SPEAKER_01]: truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were also the ones that marketed
the psychedelic orange sunshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I had seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first seed, and I didn't know what I
was going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was only 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some seeds from Kandahar,
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right before I got drafted, I was hiding
under the bed, screaming, no, send the
[SPEAKER_01]: women and children first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I had to go off to save the world
for democracy or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was 40 years ago, this past
Christmas, the first load of tie sticks
[SPEAKER_01]: came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that summer, 40 years ago this
summer, I did my first grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we did, there was several of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, it wasn't even,
what was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was the old style, man,
plant them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know anything about newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure there were newts,
even miracle grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I knew you had to water them and we
had a well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, we made some stupid money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few years later in 84, this group of
nerdy wills that I hung with, they wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to get involved in this growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of them had an uncle or a
grandfather or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that had some greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took the Kandahar seeds and we did
an open pollination to get a good genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: base to work from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same with these IVLs now,
tie seeds from the first tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, long story short, I whittled it
down to 10 plants and they came over my
[SPEAKER_01]: house that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a goodbye party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, have a good life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't call me kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had the plants arranged against the
wall in my den.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most sativa to the one that had the
most indica expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I had done all the leg work,
I grabbed the most sativa and I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: the one here, this one's mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody made a joke about,
oh, so you got like the one, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anyway, as a joke, I named it the
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that, oh, like, you know, this is like
the best in the world or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I made the mistake of writing about
that on ICMAG one night and all of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sudden, oh, yeah, the one, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one to get the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a good plant, but it's,
you know, it's just, I just kept it around
[SPEAKER_01]: because I had better things to do than I
only bought seeds one time in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all I needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: To see that where this was going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought them from Neville, the Hayes
Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now remember being in Laguna, there were
loads coming in from all around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys were real criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: This wasn't, oh yeah, you know,
I got a half pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these guys were talking about,
you know, container loads of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can imagine that containers,
uh, there's a good book called,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, orange sunshine, the story of the
hippie mafia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find it online excerpts that
appeared in the Orange County register.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, these guys are crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they once rented a helicopter in
conjunction with the black Panthers and
[SPEAKER_01]: yanked Timothy Leary out of federal prison
up in Lompoc, uh, north of Santa Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's kind of money they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, that's how the one came about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all it is, it's a Kandahar male and
then a Thai Thai stick sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was the most, uh, sativa that I
could find out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we started out, by the time we were
ready to start really investigating,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had a hundred sativa plants and a
hundred of the, uh, Thai plant and we
[SPEAKER_01]: whittled it down to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another one called blue orca.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't name any of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were all named by the respect,
most of which I never saw again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a magic crystals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there was a Mary Poppins.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how kids are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just named stuff really stupid,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, that's how I got stuck with the
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's funny is, is that by today's
standard, cause you know, we now breed for
[SPEAKER_01]: size, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the big, it doesn't matter what it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, tomatoes, it's all about size,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yield is, you know, what drives
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause consumers don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what they buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the grocery store and call it that
called tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as a commercial plan,
I wouldn't recommend it because I couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: handle the crime and the whining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I only got, you know,
fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, this wasn't a lifestyle
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a, you know, uh, a daughter to
raise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had other things in my life going on,
but just growing some plants under a light
[SPEAKER_01]: was for my own personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's a guy here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just took a plant and named it the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got t-shirts and key chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's dancing and you know,
the thing's a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do this because I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of my friends that on Instagram,
he used to be known as Cool Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had it tested and posted from the one
of the labs here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had to take it down at 63 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I usually recommend 84.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another reason people,
Oh, that's too long, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not going to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, 12 weeks, but even at 63 days,
he rolled in at almost 27% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that if you took it to how long
I would do my records, 18 weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but even at 12, I know it would be over
30.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I hear people around the trade
here that they're talking about selling
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff to dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 21, 22.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems kind of weak to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I want to feel like, you know,
somebody hit me in the, my forehead with a
[SPEAKER_01]: fist, like Mike Tyson.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I smoke, I don't want to,
it's not about, I'll really make some
[SPEAKER_01]: people angry, but I don't want like high
school weed, you know, except,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Ooh, it makes you giggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's, let's get some THC
rolling here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know some people who have taken
that plant that you've, you've shared
[SPEAKER_00]: freely with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Bill took it like 70 or 80 days
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just said it was, it was a little
too strong for him personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard anyone who's ever tried
the one ever complain about the quality or
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor or any of the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like you have a pretty amazing
plant there on your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know what it's called?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I don't call myself a breeder because
I have some integrity and I would hope
[SPEAKER_01]: that other people who do call themselves
readers might want to take that advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to be a breeder means you're a
geneticist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because you took Bob's Kush and
Crosby, you've lost it with Harry's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make you a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes you, you know, you're just
throwing crap against the wall and see
[SPEAKER_01]: what sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be the first to admit,
man, this whole thing was with the luck of
[SPEAKER_01]: the draw, LOTD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never made a claim that I'm some
great breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, but hey, you know, it's better
than the crap I bought from a Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was shocked, shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause remember in Laguna beach at that
time, you could find people that had seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: from India, Sri Lanka, the really good
Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I was talking with Tim Wilson one
time about Oaxacan Spears circa 1978,
[SPEAKER_01]: 77.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff of legends, true lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now kids just grab a name and go here,
we're going to call it this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've asked these Kush experts,
have you ever been to the Kush Valley?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really have no idea what this is,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you, how can you not like
something that, you know, sounds really
[SPEAKER_01]: exotic?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely a lot of hyperbole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard because this was a,
essentially a legal plant for so long that
[SPEAKER_00]: finding out the actual history of it is
really, really tough when we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, I think that is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I, I, to me, it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if, if, if people feel better
about themselves because they grow dim,
[SPEAKER_01]: dumb, you know, Kush, Hey, how about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care, but it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to impress me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always ask, well, how good is the
weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the whole Kush thing got started
really big, there were three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was like circa, I don't know,
2005, 2006, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got a card, not because I needed
permission from the state of Oregon to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow weed, but I wanted access to these
after you get a card groups, because you
[SPEAKER_01]: could freely exchange, you know,
meat and because it was legal,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could exchange cuts and seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went on this campaign to find all
these strains that I'd been reading about
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was just a fool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I wasn't growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them never made it past day
28.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them didn't make it past day 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, I mean, I've been growing for 40
years, so I kind of knew where this was
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't have to finish a plant to
see if I want to keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, once one plant in particular,
and everybody I've talked to has agreed
[SPEAKER_01]: with me, I won't even name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, have you ever used that many
bamboo sticks on any other other strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all started laughing and go,
never.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll bet you I had 10,
this isn't a 10 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you I had to use 10 bamboo stakes
with zip ties to hold the thing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that isn't genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just silliness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one strain that's really popular when
it, when it first showed up at ICMAG a few
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, I seriously, seriously thought
it was a joke article from the onion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the structure was that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet it became a cottage industry with
several derivatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's as much marketing around cultivars
now as there is around bottled nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I will freely give any genetic I
have away, but you got to be in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: me because I'm not sending it and I ain't
driving it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Oregon, I can legally give anybody
plant material and be in compliance with
[SPEAKER_01]: the law, both the medical laws,
as well as the, uh, the recreational laws
[SPEAKER_01]: they implemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I don't, if you knew that not
everybody might know this, but Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they decided, we already had,
we were one of the early, not first,
[SPEAKER_01]: but one of the earlier States to have a
medical plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think it goes back like 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the recreational thing after some
stumbling came into being recently last
[SPEAKER_01]: year or two, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, any household, not person,
but household, any household can grow four
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really changed the dynamic here in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, I showed you those pictures the
other day of using the Rockwell cubes with
[SPEAKER_01]: my formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always have more cuts than I can
possibly use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I give them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you still got to have,
if you want to grow, you got to have good
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guarantee you that 90% of the people
that take them wouldn't even know what
[SPEAKER_01]: that term means.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and they're going to be
disappointed and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can't grow good tomato plants
in Miracle Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm not even going to try with other
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just kind of the way I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, uh, I plus I like control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, you want to know what's in
a product that you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm the same way about my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, I physically mix it myself and I
don't deviate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the same materials in the same
proportions and that way I get consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also how you're able to test
all of these other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only have changing one thing at a time
and you know this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So intimately from growing it for 40
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I do have a daughter, another Thai
plant from that era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I got this one in 86 at a fourth
of July party with a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to call them OPH, our personal
hero and Mr. Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had this party every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was some guys that were in the
seed as group of the brotherhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did a lot of business with,
uh, you might've heard about it where you
[SPEAKER_01]: live too, Oregon and Washington,
the sacred seeds and then the consortium
[SPEAKER_01]: out of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, they were supplying seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he brought these seeds back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, this is the velvet rush and he
didn't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I planted it and I went, oh yeah,
that's a Thai plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anyway, we crossed the,
uh, I had a friend in Hawaii cause this is
[SPEAKER_01]: not the best area of the country to
produce seeds because of our weather
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to see mold and do a seed plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he crossed the velvet rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the one and the problem is that I
showed you some pictures of those giant
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not what most people need,
but one of the people that I gave those
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds to found one that's really
manageable and we call it Agnes cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I, that's the name of my dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I sent some photos to you,
but this thing is just, it's got the mass
[SPEAKER_01]: of the velvet rush, but it has the resin
set of the TO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, this is my first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Run with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to tell you, man, it's just,
I'm almost giddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had a plant produced like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I ran into Brad March from March
biological and I bought some green lace
[SPEAKER_01]: wings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I think they're called,
you know, emerald laces or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about an effective, uh, pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's decimated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the advantage is that because you're
dealing with the larva, they don't leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like ladybugs do or others because they're
adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: These aren't mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes about three weeks till they,
uh, mature and you get enough for six
[SPEAKER_01]: plants for $11.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, would you spend $11 every three
weeks, take care of six plants in a
[SPEAKER_01]: personal garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: No sprain, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, you know, I was always a doubt
because I, you know, over the years I've
[SPEAKER_01]: tried indoor and outdoor ladybugs and like
who doesn't like ladybugs and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as a stick around predator,
they're worthless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, outdoors, boom, they're off to a
new adventure in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas these, the larva, they can't fly
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They not only eat the organisms,
they eat their eggs, which is really
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're breaking the, uh, you can't use
them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it gets cold, you know how it is in the
Northwest, what three weeks ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had temperatures down in the thirties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you got to reapply or when
it warms up, if I say the end of June,
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly I'm going to be having these
tags hanging on all my tomatoes and other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons, the problems here
where you and I live west of the Cascades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a big nursery area going
back to the 1880s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know how the, I mean, you've been
in a big nursery in Monrovia and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, hundreds and hundreds of acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk about monocropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, have you ever seen, you know,
50 acres of Arborvita?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really depressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that you would sell that many,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So around the world, there's like 3,800
species of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a study by OSU in conjunction with
UW of Puyallup, they identified almost 10%
[SPEAKER_01]: of the entire world's total west of the
Cascades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see some of the challenges
we're up against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is that when
you're in the nursery business,
[SPEAKER_01]: to stay in business, you have to offer
your customers new plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And new plants come from where?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody comes along for the ride,
mites, mildew, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have challenges that you probably
wouldn't have say in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you might, you'd have other
problems like whiteflies, but you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't have some of the incredible
levels of powdery mildew that we deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what got me onto Neem is that
it wasn't until I really started studying
[SPEAKER_01]: how to use Neem correctly and the
emulsifying and all the other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can now say without any caveats,
I've been mold-free for nine years,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I also practice IPMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some people, IPM means, oh,
I saw something, I better spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you got to spray every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to have good soil because the
plant itself can ward off most diseases if
[SPEAKER_01]: you've given it the tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tools are what we've been talking
about, comfrey, kelp, and in my case,
[SPEAKER_01]: Neem meal, for those that don't choose to
use it for whatever reasons, but all those
[SPEAKER_01]: things add to the dynamic and the quality
of worm castings that consider this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first like legitimate science research
of worms castings didn't occur until 1974
[SPEAKER_01]: in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in many ways, we're really on the
cutting edge of what this entails.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a book by, he spent 65 years
has two doctorates, one from Oxford and
[SPEAKER_01]: one from Ohio State, Dr. Edwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: His book, Vermiculture Technology,
is actually an anthology of about 30
[SPEAKER_01]: articles from different writers around the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was Dr. Edwards that developed the
vertical flow through, which I had built.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan Holcomb at Oregon Soil Company,
he's the one that he and Dr. Edwards put
[SPEAKER_01]: their heads together and built this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's state of the art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would I recommend it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, get a smart pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's far easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got complete aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to feed it so much this
week because the idea is that you feed
[SPEAKER_01]: from the top and harvest from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your big producers like Worm Power in
New York, they have all vertical,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's, you know, you're talking
millions and millions and millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars that were invested in that
factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to do some for, like you
said, 200 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think of everybody set up a 200
gallon smart pot with some quality
[SPEAKER_01]: material and added some amendments that
we've discussed and just a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, think about what that would do to
the gardening dynamic of the tomatoes they
[SPEAKER_01]: grew, the flowers, roses, whatever you
like, lilies, whatever your thing is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a single plant that's not
going to benefit from the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what makes worm castings different
from thermophilic compost is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: vermiculture process is driven in large
part by enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worms not only have enzymes in their
digestive tract, they also release them
[SPEAKER_01]: from their skins to trigger specific
microbial responses, just like plants do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know more about this than I
do, but plants release exudes into the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To trigger a nutrient uptake or to,
you know, whatever instruction sets from
[SPEAKER_01]: the brain center in the taproot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants have two brain centers,
one's in the Mary stem and the other one's
[SPEAKER_01]: in the taproot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which is why topping a plant makes no
sense whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to anybody who's ever topped a plant
and I'll tell you if they're honest,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, yeah, I lost about 10 days until I
got back online, but you can bend it and
[SPEAKER_01]: you still create the same hormone that
you're wanting to see to get lateral
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just those little secrets, not secrets,
just those little, that comes from owning
[SPEAKER_01]: a nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing I would do is go out there
and, you know, be topping plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one thing is shooting yourself in
the foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another to take your shoe and sock
off to make sure it's a good clean hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're trying to grow Japanese maples
that are going to sell retail for $3,500,
[SPEAKER_01]: $4,000, why would you do stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't top your plants, tie them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the kids call it LST, low stress
training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to super cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I first got on these weed
boards, I had a fellow there, a younger
[SPEAKER_01]: guy that had helped in real life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd send him an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's LST or, okay, what's super
cropping?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that cracks me up to a sea of
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chinese developed what the kids call
today sea of green 4,500 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were also the first society to figure
out rooting on a massive level,
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that method was taken up by the French
and then it was called the French
[SPEAKER_01]: technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Alan Chadwick, a Brit,
a master organic gardening type fellow in
[SPEAKER_01]: the fifties.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called it the French, not biodynamic
bio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bio-intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then one of his students in the seventies
or late sixties and early seventies,
[SPEAKER_01]: John Jevons at the ecology action center.
[SPEAKER_01]: He modified it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wrote the book, the title,
something like how to grow more vegetables
[SPEAKER_01]: in the smallest amount of land possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all was raised beds in a five by 20
foot beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would plan them really tight on
center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would then reduce evaporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would also limit the ability for weeds
to get all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I first started 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to his school, a week long school
in Northern California and to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: bio-intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the late eighties, some,
there was two magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another one was from Tom Alexander,
who I think you've met.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had one called sense of me at tips and
some Yahoo in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've got this new method,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called see a green.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm reading this, you know,
I'm going, what do you mean you invented
[SPEAKER_01]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, see a green became,
well, those weed growers are really smart
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, because they stumbled on a
document or a manuscript out of China.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they take credit for everything and
have done nothing, you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I practice at like, especially with
strawberries, where you want really
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy strawberries and you know how
strawberries are, especially the varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: that we grow here in the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like down here, we grow a lot of hood
berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the one that you folks have
that's real popular up in the Seattle
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, with the strawberries,
you want to keep a fairly hydrated soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: not sopping, but you know, the roots do
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas tomatoes maybe wouldn't want your
soil at that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the bio-intensive method of
planting, whatever it is on center,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can, it's easier to maintain that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a copy of his book in PDF,
if you want it, John Jevons on
[SPEAKER_01]: bio-intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot more work than most of us
are going to do, I can tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can feed a family of four and
something like a thousand square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've read some of the square foot
gardening and some of those, those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they, they, I don't like using that
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say they copied them,
but yeah, they borrowed a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bio-intensive from Chadwick and the French
and John Jevons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, he still runs the ecology center,
still a learning center.
[SPEAKER_01]: People still go take his classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's not popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one area that I kind of
disagreed with some of the professionals
[SPEAKER_01]: about don't disturb the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, I practiced bio-intensive where you
do the double dig method, and I did really
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was wrong, you know, because of
the fungal thing, you know, I found it to
[SPEAKER_01]: be in a very effective way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also to check your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's my worm count at?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, I still, I don't necessarily do it
because of health reasons, but I would
[SPEAKER_01]: still recommend double dig to those who
are serious about learning a, a method of
[SPEAKER_01]: farming that goes back several thousand
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, come on, there's
something to be said for a tried and true,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's fair to compare tilling
with digging a bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all for digging an indoor bed or a
raised bed versus going strictly no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know Tim Wilson feels otherwise and
others, this whole no-till thing has
[SPEAKER_00]: really taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted an article on our blog on Kiss
Organics exactly about this topic because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was something that I thought was really
interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, for reasons that escaped me,
I've been tagged with the no-till thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've never made a post good,
bad, or indifferent about no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have opinions that are probably counter
to the urban legends, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different from the wheat that I
buy is from a family co-op over in Eastern
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington and some families in Eastern
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shepherd's grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they practice no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a whole lot different than
growing in a container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you and I had this discussion with
Tim Wilson well too, like what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between horticulture and
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I don't care how good you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider myself pretty good,
but I'm not, I recognize that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: shortcomings in an artificial soil that we
might build.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, as hard as we might try, it's not the
same thing like you and your family's
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been pumping, comfrey on these beds
for eight years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also sometimes I'll take my garden
soil, potting soil, and I'll apply it on
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it where I can stick my hand and
my arm almost to my elbow down into the
[SPEAKER_01]: bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I dig around and look for worms,
I mean, there's just a mass of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And according to the experts, I'm doing it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I shouldn't be, I mean,
I do some of my things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't plant the tomatoes in the same bed
every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't call it crop rotation,
but you know, you establish the colony of
[SPEAKER_01]: problems in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's into some degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do a squash plant there next year or,
you know, the peppers or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and then, uh, I plan,
I do a lot of, uh, beans cause I like
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like stir fry, like what they call bush
beans, green beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like stir frying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that they also add to the tilt,
but basically my whole program is kelp
[SPEAKER_01]: meal and some neem every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worm casting is about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a skin on like maybe, uh,
an inch, inch and a half just to get some
[SPEAKER_01]: biology going, you know, especially after
this winter, what the worst record and
[SPEAKER_01]: what 75 years we went through in the
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: No snow and ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that too, but yeah, I mean,
this was the hardest winter I've been up
[SPEAKER_01]: here 30 years and I was thinking about
maybe moving back to Southern Cal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I want snow where I can drive to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like up at, you know, Mount Rainier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need it in my yard or driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get out of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I had a three or six
month old bulldog.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jim, I really appreciate you taking
the time to chat today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we got to cover quite a few
subjects and I know there's a lot more I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: still love to talk to you about,
but maybe I can have you back on again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, yeah, I'd like talking about,
you know, stuff that, I feel I've,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I wouldn't say perfected, but,
uh, got into a level that I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable telling others how to,
you know, like the worm castings and I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, how simple it really is to make a
worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I bought a hundred gallon for $24
hundred gallon Smartie for $24.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, thankfully I got a donation
of the black leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, as well as I do,
I mean, you guys are making compost up
[SPEAKER_01]: there at your farm, family's farm for
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't beat black leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you want really like super
turboed plants, this is the stuff to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope there's some growers out there that
will take some of this information and try
[SPEAKER_00]: out some of these ideas and, and hopefully
not only save money, but also improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of their soil and health of their
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving forward.

online forums and Instagram as
