[SPEAKER_00]: When to put blue mats in again,
that's going to depend heavily on how much
[SPEAKER_00]: water you're adding pre during post
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're really just going to want
to keep an eye on the moisture levels in
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, whether you want to spot
check like randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to a container or a bed and just
say, literally throw a dart and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what it is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to know what it is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then another really valuable
method to doing to keeping an eye on
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture level is, you know, get like a
plastic, uh, chopstick and put a little
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of flagging tape on it and just
stick it in the bed or in a container
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere at the exact same spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's your sensing spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time you want to take a,
you know, a soil moisture reading,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got a meter, you go right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chopstick put in the exact same spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you have a consistently
consistent spot to get a sense of how fast
[SPEAKER_00]: water might be moving through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's, there's, there's pros and
cons to both of those different methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as figuring out exactly what your
soil moisture is and when to install blue mats.
