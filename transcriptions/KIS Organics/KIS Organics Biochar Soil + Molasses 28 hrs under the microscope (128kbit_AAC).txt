[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to say this surprised me,
but in a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our soil mix, our regular soil mix
with a little bit of added molasses to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found the best fungal strand that I
found on any of my samples so far in this
[SPEAKER_00]: batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, I'm seeing a lot of
strands starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm comparing this, I'm comparing
this to compost, which should naturally be
[SPEAKER_00]: higher in microbial activity than a soil
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're putting a lot of stuff in our
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of nutrient sources and a lot of
ingredients as a way of hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing that microbial activity in our
nutrient cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we just zoom in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there went a flagellate.
[SPEAKER_00]: See a lot of bacteria cruising around.
Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's another fungal strand starting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we zoom in a little bit further,
400 times magnification,
[SPEAKER_00]: there you can see what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing about these living
microorganisms is this is really what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to promote in our soils for
increasing nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what makes all those amendments
that we're adding to the soil available to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's a lot of good
diversity in the different shapes or sizes
[SPEAKER_00]: or morphology as it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really happy with the way the
sample looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is just with a little bit
of molasses added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
