[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Tad here with KISS Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to share this talk because I get
a lot of questions about what inputs are
[SPEAKER_00]: safe to use in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear a lot of talk about this on
social media, online, as well as in other
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a talk I put together for the
Living Soil Summit this year in Pahrump,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to re-record it here to share
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question I was looking at is what
inputs are safe to use in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot that goes into what products
you choose to use to grow your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to be thoughtful about
those choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by looking at some common
agricultural fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industrial meat industry is awful,
and there's no denying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These animals are fed GMO grains and
antibiotics or crops that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed with glyphosate, which is also
Roundup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, these fertilizers will be
contaminated with GMOs and antibiotics and
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're contaminating your crop when
you use these inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, blood meal, bone meal,
and feather meal are not truly organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: One could even say they're fake organic
because they come from the waste streams
[SPEAKER_00]: of our industrial meat supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the alternatives?
[SPEAKER_00]: Amendments like fish bone meal or fish
meal are much better because they're from
[SPEAKER_00]: the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a good source, like wild
caught fish, then you are utilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner amendments in your garden,
and you're not supporting the horrible
[SPEAKER_00]: meat industry, and you're doing better by
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an all-around win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's a really compelling argument
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It aligns with my values as someone who
cares about organics and the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to do today is take a
deeper look at these claims and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: research exists to either support or
refute this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the conditions under
which animals are raised in the meat
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, they're not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, to me, is the best argument for not
using these inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I also look at it from a
sustainability perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we know that these fertilizers are
safe, that they're low and heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they do not contain GMOs or
pesticides, and are very affordable,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it makes sense to me to be closing
the loop, as realistically, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going anywhere, whether these waste
products end up in compost, fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even a landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know many folks in the room are into
biomimicry, essentially doing what they
[SPEAKER_00]: think Mother Nature might do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of anything more natural or
a higher use than using a dead body to
[SPEAKER_00]: recycle the nutrients to grow something
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the fishing industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it superior to the meat industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, most folks are familiar with the
issues associated with farm fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm fish are raised in high-density
conditions similar to the meat industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm fish have a higher rate of disease
and can be higher in contaminants due to
[SPEAKER_00]: their diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make up more than half of the fish
consumption within the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between 70 and 80 percent of the fish of
the seafood consumed in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually imported.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a bit of a misleading
statistic because a portion of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: caught by American fishermen, exported
overseas for processing, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: re-imported back into the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use open net cages that can leach
chemicals into the ocean, putting ocean
[SPEAKER_00]: wildlife at risk, and damaging ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm fish have been known to escape their
pens, which can spread disease to native
[SPEAKER_00]: populations because farm fish are
regularly fed antibiotics because of their
[SPEAKER_00]: greater propensity for disease and
parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many farm fish are genetically modified as
well and can contaminate native
[SPEAKER_00]: populations like I mentioned above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their waste can produce phytoplankton
blooms, which destroy local ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can safely say that farm fish are not a
reasonable alternative to the meat
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about wild-caught fish then?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's estimated that 80 percent of the
world's natural fish stocks are fully
[SPEAKER_00]: over-exploited, depleted, or in a state of
collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bycatch is a term referring to the
unwanted fish or other marine catch
[SPEAKER_00]: creatures that are caught by commercial
fishing practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the amount of bycatch that is
captured, killed, and discarded can be as
[SPEAKER_00]: high as 80 percent for certain fisheries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something like if they are fishing
for a particular fish species like salmon
[SPEAKER_00]: and they catch an octopus or some other
animal, that would be considered bycatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists agree that at current
exploitation levels, that many important
[SPEAKER_00]: fish stocks will be removed from the
system within 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, there's a massive fossil fuel
costs associated with wild-caught fish,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in the fishing itself and then the
transportation of the fish, that
[SPEAKER_00]: import-exportation associated with
processing that I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, resources from the ocean can
have negative impacts on our environment
[SPEAKER_00]: and challenges to sustainability as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to try and see what research
there was out on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a little bit of digging,
I found a paper entitled Chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: Characterization of Commercial Organic
Fertilizers by Kurt Moeller that was
[SPEAKER_00]: published in 2015 in the Archives of
Agronomy and Soil Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this paper, the authors talk about how
there are a wide range of commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: organic fertilizers, but not a lot of
research as to how heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic pollutants like forever chemicals,
PCBs, pesticides, and antibiotic residues
[SPEAKER_00]: persist in these fertilizers and how much
variation you might see in these
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a while to track down this
paper as it wasn't easily accessible
[SPEAKER_00]: online, but it did appear to address some
of the original idea of whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: these fertilizers are safe or should be
avoided for the reasons that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: at the beginning of the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they did was they took a collection
of 77 total fertilizer samples across a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of products ranging from feather
meal, bone meal, cocoa shells,
[SPEAKER_00]: clover grass pellets, flax meal,
gluten-based fertilizers, and many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They analyzed the material on a wide
variety of parameters ranging from pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: EC, salt content, organic matter
percentage, NPK, trace minerals,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with heavy metals, pesticides,
antibiotics, GMO, and PCBs, those forever
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some of what they found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to pause it if you want to go
back and look at the data, but depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on the product, they essentially found
varying levels of heavy metals based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the product source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, all the fertilizers had some
levels of heavy metals, though many were
[SPEAKER_00]: below the detection limits of the
equipment used in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some more of that information
relating to organic persistent pollutant
[SPEAKER_00]: content and the number of positive tests
for salmonella and pesticides in these
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to highlight some of the author's
comments and notes in the study as they're
[SPEAKER_00]: related to the safety of these different
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they state the concentration of
persistent organic pollutants was close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the detection limit on a very low level
for all sampled fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, all the fertilizers had very,
very low levels of these PCBs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a big difference between
whether they were plant-based or
[SPEAKER_00]: meat-based, but they were low across the
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a relatively good sign in saying
that from a perspective of PCBs,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much all these fertilizers were
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antibiotic compounds were not found and
all the samples were GMO-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is an important statement
because some of the argument I'm hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: against using some of these fertilizers is
that they're going to be tainted with
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just simply wasn't the case in the
study based on all the samples that they
[SPEAKER_00]: took of specifically the blood meal and
the bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only some residues of few pesticides were
found in the few waste of the food
[SPEAKER_00]: processing industry, including the malt
columns, residues of the corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: maize processing, grape palm, cocoa
shells, and potato peels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only fertilizers that had any
pesticide residue were actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-based ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides is not a concern with the bone
meal or blood meal as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another section that I thought was
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The toxic element contents of most sampled
commercial organic fertilizers were low
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to values found for
source-separated organic urban waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: compost, or digestates, poultry manure,
or other livestock manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, what they're saying here is
that all these organic fertilizers are
[SPEAKER_00]: much lower in heavy metals compared to
your compost source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, they single out poultry
manure or other livestock manures down
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, most of these
animal-based composts are probably a much
[SPEAKER_00]: greater risk for bringing in all of the
things that we talked about at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of this talk than your
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there were some exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was high cadmium content in the
waste of the maize corn processing,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably related to the high cadmium
contents in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For any plant-based fertilizer,
if that plant has the ability to take up
[SPEAKER_00]: those heavy metals and there's heavy
metals in the soil that it's grown in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could potentially be contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to consider as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there wasn't high cadmium content in
the bone meal or the blood meal or any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the meat-based one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there was high lead content in horn
and hooves, which could be related to
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination during the product drying
process using open fires in the source
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The authors suspected the way that that
product, the horn and hooves product,
[SPEAKER_00]: was processed is actually what's leading
to the high lead, not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_00]: initial parent material that was used to
make the horns and hooves themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high toxic element and micronutrient
contents in the potato peel-based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer might be related to higher
concentration of these elements in the
[SPEAKER_00]: potato skin and the nutrient grading of
these elements from the periphery towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the center of the tuber.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here being that the skin of the
potato contained higher levels or higher
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations of toxic elements,
so in this case, heavy metals or
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients, than the actual flesh of
the potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as potentially some soil residues
adhering to the skin of the potatoes from
[SPEAKER_00]: processing if that soil had higher levels
of micronutrients or heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the low micronutrient content in
animal fertilizers derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: slaughterhouse activities was likewise
noteworthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be primarily just containing
those macronutrients listed above.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a lot of micronutrient
content, which is fine because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we can always pick up
another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The measured contamination of the sampled
commercial organic fertilizers with
[SPEAKER_00]: organic pollutants was several orders of
magnitude lower than the values reported
[SPEAKER_00]: for organic urban waste compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I just want to highlight the
compost is probably a much bigger risk and
[SPEAKER_00]: source of contamination in your garden
than any of these commercial fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also state that the lack of any
contamination with antibiotic compounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers derived from animal
slaughterhouses is surprising as
[SPEAKER_00]: application of antibiotic compounds has
often become a replied procedure in
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional animal husbandry in the last
decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying, yes, they recognize the
fact that many of these animals were
[SPEAKER_00]: probably treated with antibiotics,
but they were not finding any actual
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotic compounds in the feather meal,
bone meal, blood meal, the ones associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, only the minor ratio of the
supplied antibiotic compounds is absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: by the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 to 90% is excreted by animal feces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the highest pollution risk with
antibiotic residues can be expected in
[SPEAKER_00]: livestock manures as confirmed by several
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea that antibiotics are ending up
in your blood meal or bone meal doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, those things are moving through
the animal systems just like with humans
[SPEAKER_00]: and ending up in the waste products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really this poultry manure compost or
maybe poultry manure fertilizer as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: cow manure, horse manure where you'd want
to be more concerned with antibiotics and
[SPEAKER_00]: you may want to look for an organic
source, input source to avoid antibiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, contamination with pesticide residues
was only found in waste with a low level
[SPEAKER_00]: of processing like the grape, the malt,
and the cocoa shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the compounds found are used
during the storage of feedstock materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have been treated with
insecticides while they were being stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the detected residues of
insecticides belong to pyrethroids and
[SPEAKER_00]: they list below, and even a fungicide in
the case of the grape pomace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these plant-based fertilizers were
more likely to have pesticide or
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicidal contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was none found in any of the
meat-based products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the commercial organic fertilizers
were derived from a very complex
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial processes including heating and
drying at the end of the processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, this leads to de facto
pasteurization.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pasteurization is going to kill off
salmonella, E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, and a lot of these pathogens as very
few are able to survive the pasteurization
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they stayed there for the hygienic
status of most of the commercial organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers derived from these complex
processes in the food industry can be
[SPEAKER_00]: assessed as high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one sample of bone meal that
tested positive for salmonella,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably resulting from a reinfection
after the heat treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may have been something in that
particular process that allowed there to
[SPEAKER_00]: be potentially indicator bacteria for
salmonella in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about mad cow's disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another thing I've heard
associated with risks with using bone
[SPEAKER_00]: meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would state that with any organic
fertilizer that we're putting out,
[SPEAKER_00]: one should use proper PPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of things that are dusty,
like even alfalfa meal, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should wear a mask or respirator to
prevent the stuff from getting into your
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially so though with these
animal-based ones because there are things
[SPEAKER_00]: called prions, which are resistant to heat
and normal sterilization processes that
[SPEAKER_00]: can make it through this whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were four deaths in Great Britain in
the mid-90s from using bone meal from
[SPEAKER_00]: cattle that had mad cow's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they banned in 1997, the FDA banned
using protein made from ruminants like
[SPEAKER_00]: cows fed to other ruminants like pigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary source is in commercial feed
of cattle from an infectious source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I learned that I wasn't
aware of is that mad cow's disease occurs
[SPEAKER_00]: spontaneously at very low levels in all
cattle populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But only five cases have discovered and
reported in the United States ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening at a very low level and
it's a very low risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that eating meat in a lot of
cases, if you're eating anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: could potentially contain brain or spinal
cord tissue, that's a much higher risk
[SPEAKER_00]: than using bone meal in your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just didn't want to address that
because it is something that people bring
[SPEAKER_00]: up as a potential risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of the risk level of it,
I just want to state that it appears to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about blood meal?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was another interesting one because I
saw on a website from a popular company
[SPEAKER_00]: stating that blood meal is full of
antibiotics and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to research this because
that to me is pretty scary and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to use anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasted a good morning one day before
the summit trying to find anything on
[SPEAKER_00]: Google Scholar that related to blood meal
containing pathogens, containing
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics or anything about blood meals
or fertilizer that might relate to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was unable to find any research to
support these claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it was only listed on this one
website, which I think it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequently removed now, and one other
website that used it as a citation to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I show you here one of the two
websites I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to say is there's no
research that I've been able to find to
[SPEAKER_00]: support this claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would go directly against the study
that I mentioned in this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And manure-based compost and commercial
organic fertilizers may be way more
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic than your blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: One paper that I found showed that
repeated applications of chicken or swine,
[SPEAKER_00]: pig-based manure fertilizers increased
antibiotic levels in soils, but then most
[SPEAKER_00]: of it dissipated over the course of a
couple months, but not completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even worse case, you are getting
antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not persisting terribly long in
the soil, which I thought was interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: These antibiotics are poorly absorbed and
metabolized, so much of it is excreted in
[SPEAKER_00]: the waste of animals and humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's very little research on the
impact of veterinary antibiotics on soil
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if we want to avoid animals or
fish altogether or look into alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: options in the ones I've already
mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about neem then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, neem has a massive fossil fuel cost
relative to other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're shipping it all the way from India.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the potential for heavy metals and
pesticide residues, even on organic
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned this before on the podcast
and other talks where my friend Suzanne
[SPEAKER_00]: Wainwright-Evans had worked with a farm
who had failed for a chemistry of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides that's no longer allowed for
use in the United States and hasn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed since the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tracked it down after their
cannabis crop failing, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tracked it down to the neem oil
product they were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so essentially, that neem seed meal
had been crushed, the oil had been
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted, and there was enough residue of
pesticides that had been sprayed onto that
[SPEAKER_00]: neem tree that it made it into the oil and
then contaminated the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the point is neem is not a
perfect option or solution either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about soft rock phosphates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a mined product, so it's going
to contain heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no way around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has large fossil fuel costs,
not only the mining process itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the transportation of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may be mines that are cleaner in
other countries outside of North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the cost to get that product here is a
massive fossil fuel cost that one should
[SPEAKER_00]: account for when considering what products
they want to use in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be ecological and
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same goes for guanos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work, but large fossil fuel costs
associated with them, they're harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: overseas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They damage the local ecology with that
harvesting in many cases, and they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are more sustainable options or
alternatives?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about alfalfa meal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfalfa meal has massive water
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I use in almost every
garden prescription that I make.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a relatively low NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires a lot of water to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a wonderful microbial source,
but it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's the point I really want
to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to talk about
sustainability, then we really have to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at reducing our carbon footprint and
our inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means learning to cultivate with
fewer inputs and not falling for the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing around hype products or things
in the bottles that we may really not
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we want to talk about
sustainability, insect frass to me is
[SPEAKER_00]: really one of the most sustainable
nutrient sources available on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, though, it does have
limited sources and it has variable
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is the most sustainable option for
closing a loop in our food supply because
[SPEAKER_00]: we can feed our food waste to these
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can process it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then essentially, their manure tends
to be very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains good microbial activity and
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tends to be a pretty good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what about compost and manures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are also a great option.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they can contain plastics,
antibiotics, pesticides, and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, if we want to talk about what's
organic and what's fake organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: truly, our compost and manures have much
more risk associated with them and much
[SPEAKER_00]: more contamination associated with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's just something that we
need to recognize when we're making a
[SPEAKER_00]: decision in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say this as someone who loves
compost, highly advocates for compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to be careful with it and not
demonize certain products over other
[SPEAKER_00]: products based on an agenda that may or
may not be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost is probably going to contain heavy
metals, so we need to use it sparingly if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in a regulated state or if the
compost inputs contain heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, where we land is trying to
source things locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even folks that purchase soil from
us that we ship to them, we then try to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with them to use the fewest number of
inputs as possible in order to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And try and source things as much as they
can locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the limitations with locally sourcing
things is limited options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be able to get all of the
products you want or clean versions of
[SPEAKER_00]: those products locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the reality of the
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may lead you to having to
purchase some things online and have them
[SPEAKER_00]: shipped to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best thing that we can do is reuse
our soil and reduce our inputs while
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point of this whole talk is really
not to say that like one input is better
[SPEAKER_00]: than another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not here to say that blood meal or
bone meal or feather meal are superior to
[SPEAKER_00]: fish bone meal or fish meal or other
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I could have made the same talk
around mine products like rock dust or
[SPEAKER_00]: peat moss versus cocoa core or just about
any other input in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to put together this talk as a
way of encouraging growers to think
[SPEAKER_00]: critically and separate out a marketing
message from reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times these messages are crafted
to sell you products by allowing a company
[SPEAKER_00]: company to differentiate themselves around
the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes these messages or concepts
can be really powerful because they tug on
[SPEAKER_00]: our emotions are fit with our values.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you dig just a little bit deeper,
the reality of it can be entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in closing, I want to challenge you to
think critically and deeply about how you
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be open minded to new ideas, but also do
your own research and don't accept
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that you hear at face value,
regardless of how authoritative or
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable this person may be or how
many followers they may have on social
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you practice JDOM or KNF or
biodynamics or soil food web, at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the day, there's wisdom and
misinformation in every one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until my good friend,
Tim Wilson, called me out about some
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I was saying about compost tea
that I had heard from the foremost expert
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry and challenged me to test
it out for myself that I became a more
[SPEAKER_00]: critical thinker and it made me a better
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always trial new ideas or products
in a test plot in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, if you make a hypothesis and take a
scientific approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, though,
regardless of what method you use or what
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments you choose to use in your
garden, there's a million ways to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you're being thoughtful and
with an eye towards sustainability,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's all good in my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for checking out this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please reach out if you have any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
