[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is an African Nightcrawler
earthworm castings combined with neem cake
[SPEAKER_00]: and molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, there's a, we're still
getting some fungal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about 28 hours in right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at 100 times magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we zoom in, 200 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get an idea of just how much bacterial
activity there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the entire, here's the fungal,
fungal hypha.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the entire slide looks like this in
terms of bacterial activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just teeming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're now at 400 times magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at the African
Nightcrawlers without any, any food
[SPEAKER_00]: sources, we didn't really see a lot of
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am inclined to think that the neem
cake is a decent food source, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: for bacteria here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't seem to be inhibiting
fungal growth as I am seeing it on this
[SPEAKER_00]: slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it is, it's minor,
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
