[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is a timely one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Bowman is founding chair of the
National Hemp Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also the author of section 7,
606 of the 2014 Farm Bill, a provision
[SPEAKER_01]: that grants U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers the right to cultivate hemp in
states where hemp production is now legal
[SPEAKER_01]: for the first time since Congress passed
the 1933 Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's known in some circles as Mr. Hemp for
his activism, and he has been instrumental
[SPEAKER_01]: in shaping the state of Colorado's hemp
policy as chair of Colorado's New Energy
[SPEAKER_01]: Future and served as co-chair of
Governor-elect Bill Ritter's Energy
[SPEAKER_01]: Transition Team.
[SPEAKER_01]: A graduate of the Colorado Agriculture and
Rural Leadership Program, Michael spent
[SPEAKER_01]: his entire adult life in rural advocacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has served as founding board member of
numerous environmental and hemp advocacy
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations, including the Rocky
Mountain Hemp Association, Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: Industrial Hemp Commission, the American
Renewable Energy Institute, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Sustainable Biodiesel Alliance,
to name a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is also a co-founder of the Colorado
Farm to Cafeteria Work Group, advisor to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Savory Institute, and a board member
of the National American Industrial Hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael is a Next Generation Fellow in
Columbia University's American Assembly
[SPEAKER_01]: and a 2008 recipient of Gamma Sigma
Delta's significant achievement in
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture by Colorado State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: With everything going on right now around
hemp, I thought it was the perfect time to
[SPEAKER_01]: get him on the show to answer some
questions about what to expect in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought on Nelson Lindsley from Poetry
of Plants to assist me in the interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the audio quality of this taping
wasn't as good as I would have liked,
[SPEAKER_01]: so apologies in advance for some of the
background noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you as well to Nelson Lindsley
of Poetry of Plants for coming on as well
[SPEAKER_01]: to help with the interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Michael, I really wanted to start out
just talking a little bit about your
[SPEAKER_01]: personal background and how you got into
everything that you're doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks, dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a fifth generation Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up on our family's farming and
ranching operation on the Eastern Plains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after college, spent a couple of
decades full-time with the family farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a rather large operation,
but I was always interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability and the environment and
rural development and technology and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that nexus of things that kind of keep us
on the cutting edge of what's next in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were plagued by the fact that
our operation was over the Ogallala
[SPEAKER_00]: Aquifer where we grew and grow a lot of
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that entire aquifers, you might know,
is one of the largest underground aquifers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are unsustainably depleting it to
grow corn predominantly in a way that...
[SPEAKER_00]: And under kind of an economic model where
it may be one of the worst economic models
[SPEAKER_00]: ever devised, we're pulling fossil water
from the ground with coal-fired power from
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming to produce a crop that needs to be
subsidized by the federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely a house of cards that
we've set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was always interested in what's
next?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we transition from corn to
something else?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we keep our rural communities
viable?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next magic trick to help us get
better at what we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, and this was in the late
90s and early 2000s, I was spending a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of time in Zimbabwe with Alan Savory on
soil management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil carbon interested me a lot in its
play and absorbing atmospheric carbon with
[SPEAKER_00]: good organic content and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those days, you could talk about
carbon sink or carbon absorption and
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly get blank stares from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I happened to be in Zimbabwe one trip
and we were sitting around a campfire one
[SPEAKER_00]: night and an Australian couple came
through and they had just been in India
[SPEAKER_00]: where they were talking about this
transition from a hemp economy,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a hemp-based economy,
to GMO cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the struggles that the farmers
were going through and the trouble they
[SPEAKER_00]: were having taking this centuries-old
practice and what they were doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp and moving into this
chemically-based world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, and still are,
there was a lot of suicides happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm country because of, because what
was happening in that society when you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't take care of your family
financially, there's an honor suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something over 200,000 farmers
today that have committed suicide that are
[SPEAKER_00]: generally related to this transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were doing it, and many of them
were doing it by drinking the very
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals they were being forced to put on
their land for the first time ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I came at this initially from a
social justice warrior perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, this is just wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to figure out what's happening
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I wandered through that
history and the story and the industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp plant, I became obsessed with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, our farm was in the
central Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were far enough west that they were
just breaking out prairie and starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: farm about the time prohibition was in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it put in place in 37.
[SPEAKER_00]: So industrial hemp farming never made it
as far west.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was never introduced to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I learned about the plant and
its need, basically something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally benign and something that
had thousands of products that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: made from the plant and could be drought
tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just checking every box for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay, why aren't we in the
United States doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Went back and studied the history of the
prohibition and what happened in 37.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then through 1970 with Nixon and the
Controlled Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then got really fired up about the
policy side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd done a lot of work in DC and continue
to do so around environment sustainability
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last couple of decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was no stranger to Washington and no
stranger to state politics as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so started my journey in Colorado of
educating people about hemp from 2006 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: I and another woman, Linda Parker,
and Denver did quarterly meetings and
[SPEAKER_00]: reached out to farmers and the bar
association and legislators and regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about this plant and why is it
illegal and could Colorado step up and be
[SPEAKER_00]: the tip of the spear on ending this
national prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so 2011, we got our legislature to
pass a resolution unanimously supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: the reintroduction of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early 2012 then, we got our
legislature to pass a phytoremediation
[SPEAKER_00]: bill, a small one that Colorado State
University could play in after the forest
[SPEAKER_00]: fires, kind of reclaiming some soil from
the vast fires we'd had this summer
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the course of 2012,
the fall of 2012, we passed our historic
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment 64, which ended prohibition of
the plant in its entirety from
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational adult use to industrial hemp
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we scored that as our win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State legalized that same
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a time zone ahead, so we like to say
we did it first, but we did it the same
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And off we went and formed a national
organization, the National Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: Association, of which I was founding board
chair, and worked at both the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: level and state levels then on getting
states to legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, from that night in November of
12 when Colorado and Washington legalized,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've gone from 2 that evening to 41
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the late May, early June of 2013,
I wrote some language and took it to then
[SPEAKER_00]: Congressman Polis, who is now the governor
of Colorado, and asked if he would
[SPEAKER_00]: consider including this in the amendment
process for the then House language for
[SPEAKER_00]: the 2013, which became the 2014 Farm Bill,
that became Section 7606, which was the
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment that really opened the door for
this industry to start doing what it does
[SPEAKER_00]: best, innovating and growing and creating
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you see now over the last five
years, 7606, by opening that door,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've created the beginnings, I think,
of a substantial and lasting industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think last year we had about 75,000
acres U.S.-wide in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the recent Farm Bill
that was signed about a little over a
[SPEAKER_00]: month ago deschedules the plant and does a
number of other things along with that
[SPEAKER_00]: language.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're well out of the barn now
and looking forward to creating these
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities and letting them get into a
place again where we can lead in
[SPEAKER_00]: production and development of products and
job creation and all the things we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: well when we have good policy in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can we expect for this year with
the addition of the 2018 Farm Bill?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you seeing out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's some irrational
exuberance about where we are,
[SPEAKER_00]: not about the plant's potential or where
we're going to go, but really where we are
[SPEAKER_00]: as an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per the Farm Bill, we still have a process
that has to be put in place by the feds,
[SPEAKER_00]: federal standards, state plans being
approved and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, the government wanted to
shut down the day after the Farm Bill was
[SPEAKER_00]: signed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing has been done per the
prescriptive remedies in the Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have to get those done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The states that are legal will be in the
process of submitting plans to the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that aren't legal are going to have
to step up this session.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to do anything,
but they have the opportunity to step up,
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize, and let their farmers be in the
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Iowa today and tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iowa is one of the nine that has not
legalized much to the chagrin of many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the producers here in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be trying to tease out
those legislators who have been somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: reluctant to step up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step into this space and get them in a
position of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be talking to a
conference of over 900 land managers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow who control a lot of land in the
United States that are interested in this
[SPEAKER_00]: as a viable third crop and new rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, if we're going to take this
industry to the fiber and bioplastics and
[SPEAKER_00]: composites world and hempcrete and the
things that we know that's fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's very good at, we're going to have
to get to a scale in acreage that's far
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think 2019 is still going to be,
I still see this as a transition year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll likely see again a bump in acreage,
but I don't think we're going to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: large increases until after this year
because of some of the constraints that
[SPEAKER_00]: are still practically in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael, what's the biggest pushback
you're hearing from the legislation and
[SPEAKER_02]: the politicians on the government scale
side of things to keep this from being
[SPEAKER_02]: legal in all 50 states?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a curious thing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it directly related to cannabis or is
it another?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it's still, I think,
a lingering the reefer madness here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is generational.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got, if you have a regulator or
a legislator who's maybe in their
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies or early eighties, they really
do believe that this is the devil's
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce, you know, no matter what you say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: To them, there is no distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, interestingly enough,
in Hawaii yesterday, Representative
[SPEAKER_00]: Cynthia Thielen, who has been a bulwark on
this, she's just an incredible,
[SPEAKER_00]: been an incredible supporter of this
industry over her years in the Hawaii
[SPEAKER_00]: state legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to put out a very terse press release
to the department, to the Hawaii
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture's bill that they
had submitted to their just convened
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature, where they still refer to it
as a scheduled substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in their case, there's a very active
DEA concern over there that has never
[SPEAKER_00]: liked the idea of legalizing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other cases, I'd say, in Iowa,
I think it's been, Senator Grassley has
[SPEAKER_00]: been very slow to warm up to this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think that's for him,
that's generational.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do, you know, they just believe this
is a slippery slope to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin for babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the question, where do we
stop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe you stop somewhere between
heroin for babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's, you know,
the jokes kind of write themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't mean that it's not funny
because this is a serious issue when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking, debating science, but it is,
amusing that in 2019, we're still having
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based arguments on this plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you mentioned was just
sort of maybe to mute the exuberance a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit for 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was something I heard a lot of from
other policy experts that are around hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm understanding you correctly,
you're thinking that 2019 is still going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the year of getting policy and
regulation in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it probably won't be till 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe even later when it's really going
to hit and we're going to have this boom
[SPEAKER_01]: with industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll still see some growth in the
industry this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, we've seen sometimes
two to three X growth year to year since
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will have some growth, but frankly,
we don't have the infrastructure in place
[SPEAKER_00]: to handle a large crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we don't want to do is make the
same mistake Canada did in 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1998, 1999, where they opened the door,
let the farmers, you know, the farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: grew, you know, a lot of acreage early on
with really no market developed,
[SPEAKER_00]: no infrastructure to take that seed into a
hemp heart or, you know, the stock into a
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber herd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got to have, this is an all
hands on deck opportunity slash challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: here to bring, you know, private interests
and money and government and policy and
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers together to build this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can do it quickly with the
right with the right partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we, you know, we have a lot of
probably the most the largest void in all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this is the lack of infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one other question I've had is I've
heard a lot of issues around cross
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination with type one plants,
a lot of concern from cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are growing high THC plants with this
idea of industrial hemp taking off and
[SPEAKER_01]: poor regulation on the part of farmers
will cause, you know, them to ruin a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of sense of mea crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is a, you know, that is a valid
concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to deal with that in Colorado early
on, you know, South Colorado, Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado and your Pueblo, where there was
a lot of both outdoor marijuana grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, you know, I think under
the threat of the county and state,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, instituting regulations,
they've self regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in Oregon, I think they,
if I remember right, that the first year
[SPEAKER_00]: that they canceled the industrial hemp
program the first year because of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most concerns of the established type
one growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that those are valid concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are concerns in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're frankly going to be concerns in a
lot of places, if not everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the, you know,
that is that is one of the issues we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really going to have to look at carefully
and you can keep everybody informed on
[SPEAKER_00]: that because we, the last thing we want is
a, and the possibility of a, of a train
[SPEAKER_00]: wreck where we have, you know,
people permitted to do type one and type
[SPEAKER_00]: two, you know, fence, you know,
fence row to fence row here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to incorporate that,
that it's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is the solution right now, regulation
around locations so that making sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: say for example, that any industrial hemp
is going to be at least five miles or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever distance is deemed appropriate
from say pre-existing type one cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at the very least it's going to
take some, you know, the state regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to map this and be able to,
you know, when an application is received
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, either, either respond or,
or, because I think it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little messy in the, in the beginning,
because there's going to be a rush of
[SPEAKER_00]: permits, you know, for, for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the lack of a, of a state or
county regulatory framework is going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: is going, we're going to, I can,
I think we'd almost be assured we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a couple of train wrecks this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean large ones, but we're going
to, we're going to have this collision
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere, somehow, how some way,
because there just isn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: enough oversight in place to at least even
just alert the folks, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happening in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so you think that some legal growers
in states are going to get hit with pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: just out of the blue at some point,
unaware that there was even going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: their area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, is that the concern that you're
raising?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think, yes, I do think that that's
exactly the, like the case tab that there
[SPEAKER_00]: will be, there will be some, you know,
unintended, these aren't going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, purposeful plants and,
and nobody's doing that to, to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to purposely harm another, but I,
I, I, I, I can imagine that we will have
[SPEAKER_00]: that scenario in more than one place in
19.
[SPEAKER_01]: Changing direction on the genetic side,
where are you finding most, most people
[SPEAKER_01]: are sourcing seed and are you seeing any
particular cultivars being more highly
[SPEAKER_01]: sourced or cultivated than others at this
point in time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, most of the seed for the traditional
grows, I would say just from my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, it's coming out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: The X 59 seems to be, you know,
very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some, there's a company
bringing in seeds now from, from Eastern
[SPEAKER_00]: or Western Europe that they believe will
be the wool, you know, when we get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and now that we're going to see a lot
of that until we get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more certified seed in place, more,
more of our own genetics in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Colorado is getting a hot bed
right now for genetic work, seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: seed genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so it, but you know, all the,
all, all, everything is coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your small quantity still test plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the bulk of this is still going
to be from the traditional side again,
[SPEAKER_00]: imports.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you see, I haven't seen an
industrial hemp field in person yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what I'm picturing is something with a
lot of genetic diversity and variety where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have plants of all heights
and sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't gotten breeding as I understand
it to the point where like another
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural crop where you'll see
consistency across the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we headed that direction or are you
already seeing some of that in the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, you know, from what I,
from my, keep in mind, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vast majority of acres in the U S have
been non-traditional, but the,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've seen some fields of the Canadian
seed brought in that was very uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have witnessed a field in Colorado and,
and one in Kentucky that was very erratic
[SPEAKER_00]: in its, in its heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, and I don't know what seed,
what seed stocks, the, the erratic heights
[SPEAKER_00]: were, but, but from what I saw on the,
on the import from, from the Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: side, they seem to be pretty uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got a two-parter Michael.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any way you could explain why the
wording regarding the FDA and the food,
[SPEAKER_02]: drug and cosmetic act authority was
included in the bill?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind that, you know,
this bill was, was predominantly written
[SPEAKER_00]: in Senator McConnell's office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it's been the bulk of that
language has been a kind of a succession
[SPEAKER_00]: of, of language from the 2000,
from the, from the industrial farming act
[SPEAKER_00]: that started in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say that I think that, you know,
as we're, as we're, as we're ending an
[SPEAKER_00]: eight decade old oversight of the,
the federal government by this and the
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns that have had their fingers on
this pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that where that be FDA or DEA,
you know, these, you know, these,
[SPEAKER_00]: these old regulators die hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I think that I'm going to,
I'm somewhat speculated, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the FDA has always had authority over
labeling and claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they will continue to,
to do that to the extent that we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in the supplement or food additive
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we're D even though that we're
going to be de-scheduled in an
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural crop, you know, I think
there, this is just a matter of a,
[SPEAKER_00]: of a, of a timeframe of how we kind of,
we lessen that oversight and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and get to a, you know, kind of,
you know, a less relaxed atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean relaxed in the sense that
we want to put anything out bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mean that, that the, the,
and I think, and I think we need to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the, the, the nuance and the rhetoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from that, from their
statements, their, their, their statement,
[SPEAKER_00]: which came out the day after, you know,
I think was, you know, when I look at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, you know, I think they had
to do what they had to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they still have their, their
framework and what they think they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this policy journey isn't done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have some, we'll have some
cleanup language.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we may, you know, over time,
see things like increases in the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that a year ago, Congressman Bob
Goodlatte, who was the chair of the house
[SPEAKER_00]: judiciary was open to moving that up to a,
to a point six.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I, I, I, I don't get too
tangled up in some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I watch a lot of social media feeds and
I generally don't engage because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a lot of, you know, hysteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of, it goes from hysteria
to concern to, well, this is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for, and for my world, which has generally
been politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think these, these things are,
it's just not one giant step and you fix
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue to tweak and, and,
and, and make it better for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I'm not a, I'm not really a
conspiracy theory guy on, on, on what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on here, but maybe they exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I don't, you know, that's not my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, and I don't really kind of
fall into that camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're demonstrating that this
is going to be a, you know, a serious
[SPEAKER_00]: robust industry with a lot of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and, and, and if there's anything
politicians understand is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the job creation and the things that,
all the things that are good about this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's our job as advocates to
continue to push for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: better and better language and
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, and it's the regulator's job to,
to take as a, generally take it as
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative approach as they can with
the, with the, with the regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been handed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere in the middle of all that we,
we find a way to, to all coexist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's, you know, that's,
that's my, my opinion and not shared by
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone, but that's, but it's,
but it's mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're in Iowa, like you said,
which is a state that is not legalized
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you seeing from farmers there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, crop farmers that have
been growing other vegetables and other
[SPEAKER_01]: crops, is there becoming sort of this
acceptance of, of hemp as a, as a
[SPEAKER_01]: possibility or people getting excited
about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there still a lot of negativity and,
and, and things like that around the crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I see, and I see and hear a lot of
enthusiasm for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, again, just the, the,
this general disconnect between
[SPEAKER_00]: policymakers and, you know, farmers and,
and rural advocates and those,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those on the ground, mostly rooted in,
you know, again, decades old myths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lies and, and constructs that,
that made no sense at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I think it's general enthusiasm and,
but, but in an Iowa's case, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very corn centric.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of genetics companies and
chemical companies here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this is all, you know,
built upon that, that house of cards,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we'd call the, you know,
the farm bill, the, and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that, that props that system
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, there's infrastructure and
history here and a legacy to what Iowans,
[SPEAKER_00]: many Iowans think they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a very, I think a strong
and growing group out there that know that
[SPEAKER_00]: we need, you know, we need a third way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a, we need a third, a legitimate
third crop to, to do a lot of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's cleaning up soil,
cleaning up the environment and creating
[SPEAKER_00]: new jobs for rural Iowa and rural America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brought up an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you mentioned remediation.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking about hemp right now,
how do you, how are you defining that
[SPEAKER_01]: versus say, a lot of what people are
talking about around CBDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I realized that it seems that a lot of
the cultivation that people are most
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about right now is not from like a
textile or more traditional industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp perspective, but really for the,
the CBD possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are, how are you defining these terms
and how do you think they're relevant in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of how people are looking to grow
the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd say in the regenerative space,
that is, that is, that is most definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in, in, in, in the traditional
grows, not the, not the CBD space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have, and one side we have
on the CBD side, you know, health and
[SPEAKER_00]: wellness and, and, and, and, and,
and, you know, grown naturally and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the job creation and doing what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then then over on the other side of the,
of the, the ledger with more traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: grows is where we're going to,
we're going to see the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the practice of regenerative soil
and, and, and soil remediation and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the things that that plant does
best when it's planted in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the, in the more traditional terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you seeing as maybe becoming part
of a more conventional crop cycle for
[SPEAKER_01]: Iowans is a way of remediating the soil
then is that, is that what you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it'll be both because I
think that the magic of this plant is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it presides, you know, it provides a
space for, for everyone, whether you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: small Iowa farmer, who wouldn't be
surrounded by traditional crops that
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to incorporate, you know,
some, some, a CBD grow for a young,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one of your children wanted to
return or you're a young person coming
[SPEAKER_00]: back, wanting to come back to the rural
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have, I think the,
and, and you're willing to put in that
[SPEAKER_00]: work in that time, you know, I,
the, the CBD space, you know, allows that
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to come to fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a more traditional Iowan,
if you're a corn and soybean farmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for a rotation,
maybe your, your buffer areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be better suited to a hemp crop
from, from a water quality and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity perspective, you'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, we're going to get back into,
you know, this, these spacing issues and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and the, you know, pollination
challenges with that, but, but we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could wave a magic wand and
create whatever policy you wanted around
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and cannabis, how would you set up a
state like Iowa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that we, we may see,
and it may be useful if we get it down to
[SPEAKER_00]: a more local level or from a county
perspective, you know, now that we've,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've, we've ended the prohibition of the
federal level, we have statewide
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, but I think ultimately this
is going to have to come down to some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some county involvement where we,
where, where we, where we map or they,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to have to be, I think
there's going to have to be a lot of work
[SPEAKER_00]: on the county level on, on how these
worlds are going to live together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any way of getting around that
because as in my, you know, my,
[SPEAKER_00]: my earlier description of, you know,
small farmers coming back, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of small, you know, small farms here in
Iowa who are trying to hang on,
[SPEAKER_00]: did over Minnesota and Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were spending a lot of time with the
last couple of weeks, there's small
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers wanting to get into this space
and, and, and, and maybe we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have regions where, where the counties
will permit one, but not the other,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they give priority to one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the permitting process has a,
you know, it has a priority chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and, but I just don't know how we're
going to get around not doing that,
frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think this crop could be a savior
for a lot of struggling farmers on the
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural side, or at least it might
have that potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I, I, I've seen it in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is, this is attracting
young people back to these small farms and
[SPEAKER_00]: towns that, that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, you know, these young people and,
and are very excited and they're excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're not going to come back to
these small towns to grow corn or soybeans
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this, this, this plant just opens up a
whole new range of opportunities for that
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you, I've spent a lot of,
again, going back to Minnesota and
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin the last couple of weeks,
you know, these, these small dairy farms
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just, you know, just dying on the
vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're not dead already as a dairy
farm, you know, they have land,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have barns, they have ways to,
you know, get back in the game and stay on
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, that's really
excited me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my maternal grandfather was a small
dairy farmer in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived in a county that was one of the
largest milk producing counties in
[SPEAKER_00]: Minnesota, you know, 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's almost no dairies left
today, but the whole, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rich land, the barns, these kids and
descendants who want to come back,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really, for me, I'm really excited
about that, you know, that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also excited about the regenerative
nature and getting a legitimate third crop
[SPEAKER_00]: in a, in a rotation for the corn and
soybean farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, what hits home the closest is
this opportunity for the smaller farms to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, have something that's going to
let them be viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this could be a big economic boon
for the state as well, I feel like,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially those states that are more
agrarian and have struggled, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of, it seems like, you know,
the center of the United States there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see, see hemp as maybe being that
possible crop, especially if we,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we eventually move to some intrastate,
you know, commerce on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more convinced than ever now that that
is, that is, that this, that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the real deal for the,
for that, for those communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael, when we're looking at the,
the regulations around the THC percentage,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you think that we'll get to a point
where there'll be some rounding on the THC
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage or is 0.31 going to be counted
the same as point, or, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10, you know, like, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a very, like the cultivars for CBD
hemp, and I did seven acres this last
[SPEAKER_02]: season, but they're, they're not super
stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have very, you know, a lot of them
have been back crossed into cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: strains to get certain turf profiles or
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my question is, how are they,
how are we going to be looking at this at
[SPEAKER_02]: the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then once you extract the,
the CBD, you're going to be left with a
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration that's above that limit of
THC that's to be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are they looking at this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And where do you think the future of how
they're going to treat the THC percentage
[SPEAKER_02]: in the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, we are, we are going to have to
have this conversation, both at the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal level, and as we see how the,
the, the feds put their standards in
[SPEAKER_00]: place, maybe we'll get a little flavor of
where, where USDA is going to come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at the state level, for instance,
in Colorado, you know, I do think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to, we're going to have to,
and I think we have the political will to
[SPEAKER_00]: set some kind of research, you know,
research category in place that goes from,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say 0.3 to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just throwing out some, it may be 0.8
or it may be something other, other than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in, in our case, I'm going to
use, in Colorado's case, we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature and a governor and a
university system who wants our farmers to
[SPEAKER_00]: flourish and understand that we're early
on in this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you know, not everything's stable
and there's, there's no reason what the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology and the science we,
we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And access to that, that's something
that's 0.31 should be destroyed and
[SPEAKER_00]: considered, you know, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to, I'm going to
guess that in this next year, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is going to be one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be others that they're going to
kind of step out and say, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to, you know, we're going to,
we're going to put a buffer here and
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, then, then, and then probably
have to go back from a policy perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: back to a federal level, to the federal
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and do some tweaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's what I kind of referred to
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: These, these policy changes are,
you know, they're just not a one and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, you know, this is going to
be a constant modification or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be a modification for,
for a period of time as this industry
[SPEAKER_00]: grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as we know, I, you know,
we want to get back to science-based
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been in private meetings with DEA
concerns who would say privately that they
[SPEAKER_00]: think that the standard ought to be 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're not going to say that
publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's against, you know, that's in the
face of the scheduling parameters and what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're forced to regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they would tell you that, you know,
that they think this, and we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not, there's no science behind the
point three, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think our next battle is going to be
proving that, you know, proving that out
[SPEAKER_00]: and putting something in place that can
be, from a scientific perspective would
[SPEAKER_00]: be, be put in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And would that also relate to other
cannabinoids that are in the plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: are not considered schedule one,
but may have a medical value?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a lot in the hemp and
cannabis hemovars that have more value
[SPEAKER_02]: that we haven't even discovered yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And has there even been a conversation on
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or has it just been a conversation around
PHC and CBD, which in my opinion is kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of limited?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind, you know, the language
does, you say, you know, all extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more to your point, to your question,
Ted, was no, the only conversations are
[SPEAKER_00]: really around, you know, THC and just the
general CBD discussion, but nothing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we have not drilled down beyond
that, you know, in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other thing I heard,
I got to hear Ron, Ronald Turco from
[SPEAKER_01]: Purdue speak, and I'm hoping to get him on
the show too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things he mentioned is a
lot of it was around timing of harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: When, when you harvest the plant really
determines that THC content and plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, may fail or may not fail
was really related just to timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, another one of those, you know,
that you're kind of that going back to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, making those, you know,
those science based arguments like he
[SPEAKER_00]: made, you know, to regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and again, you know, I think we're,
you know, we're so early in this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we, if we, if you really think
back, we, we, we took on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight decades of lies and myths and,
and, and turned it on its head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how often do we see that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in our federal government from,
you know, from policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, again, and again,
going back to that exuberance or
[SPEAKER_00]: irrational exuberance, I think what we,
what, what we've, where we've gotten to is
[SPEAKER_00]: monumental.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we still have a lot of work to go,
you know, a long way to go yet and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: this right and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can't rest on our laurels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to, you know, bring,
you know, tease these things out,
[SPEAKER_00]: test some of the state levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an argument in Congress for,
you know, for making tweaks and changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we certainly have, you know,
the activists in this community are
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we, if we can, if we can not,
if we can, if we can not mire ourselves in
[SPEAKER_00]: infighting and and, you know, and focus on
kind of what's next, we'll, we'll be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: better off for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there will be a lot of what's
next because we've got a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Michael, when I talk to other
individuals that are getting into the
[SPEAKER_02]: space or investors, a lot of what I hear
is that they're looking at international
[SPEAKER_02]: supply of hemp biomass and derivatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of hemp and that that's going to be where
the market that the market isn't going to
[SPEAKER_02]: really land in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't really believe that
personally, I think that there's a unique
[SPEAKER_02]: environments here that are going to be
specialized, but I'm hearing that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's a bit, it seems like the
international hemp market has a good
[SPEAKER_02]: headstart on American progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question would be, how do we
balance those imports with our,
[SPEAKER_02]: our own growth and how do we help educate
people on the value?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the timeline, essentially what it
appears to be a timeline on the market in
[SPEAKER_02]: a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I through through through my
glasses, and in my view, we are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have some imports.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of that happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether it's imports of biomass,
whether it's imports of Canadian money
[SPEAKER_00]: coming into the country to, you know,
to build this industry, what Americans are
[SPEAKER_00]: really good at is when you put a good
policy in place and turn them loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the world knows this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we innovate quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We you know, we do good big things fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I'm I'm I think we'll
have two phases here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see some of this
international.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see the importing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see we're going to see a
lot of positioning by by folks who want
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, claim that X is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe that I believe in kind of
an American ingenuity and what we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do what we can do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we are we are going to quickly
catch up with the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then then be a leader beyond
that point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of part of what I think is going to
help us become that is on the genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: development and innovation around the
cannabis genome and the research that that
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of cannabis companies are beginning
to do and how that will carry into hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with all that in mind, do you is there
a clear path for hemp seed USDA
[SPEAKER_02]: certification at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that still ambiguous?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I look at the some of the
regulations in California, because
[SPEAKER_02]: California has not issued farm ID yet,
but they're allowing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's this weird kind of wild west
cowboy gray area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they require is a a type of seed
certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they call it like foundational
generational.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's another term that I think
that's escaping me right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a hemp farmer in California
and you're required to start with some
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of level of certified hemp seed,
would that mean that you would have to
[SPEAKER_02]: purchase the seed out of the country like
for, you know, with some other
[SPEAKER_02]: international certified seed stock?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that something that we can create
under a research program with the right
[SPEAKER_02]: research institution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that they're going to have
to get the Oscar sort of the international
[SPEAKER_00]: certification is probably going to have to
come up like California is just you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I talk to folks, when you look at the
mess in California and the keystone cops
[SPEAKER_00]: in Hawaii on this thing, you just think
really, we are in 2019, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, well, some of us aren't yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so so I think that's I think
California is, you know, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to welcome California to the
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get their act together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your point, I think they're going to
they're going to have just some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: international certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the I believe I haven't stayed
like really close to the rollout of the of
[SPEAKER_00]: the down in the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do believe that there's a pretty
significant influence from the Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: seed market in that in that California
framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we'll see how that plays.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that in mind, what I've seen so
the hemp, the hemp cultivars that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: able to purchase, you know, I really look
at as a low THC cannabis cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were created under a research
program and certified under the purchase
[SPEAKER_02]: of another industrial hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just been a little unclear on how
there's a highway or a path for these new
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars to emerge where they can be
considered hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just being measured on THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is there going to be some?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this just still muddy and I'm asking
questions that can't be answered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think for me that you're probably
asking the question that I can answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that you have to be seen and
you have to you have to be seen how that
[SPEAKER_00]: plays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I I wish I could I wish I had a good
answer for that, Ted, but I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so and then the final thing I just
wanted to say is I wanted to thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: personally for being a part of this
movement and doing the work that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's opened up a considerable amount of
doors for a lot of people you probably
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know and a lot of people you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see that this opportunity is saving
a lot of struggling cannabis, cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm seeing a lot of pivots from
cannabis into hemp because some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding and experience will apply,
especially when cultivating the higher
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to thank you for all
that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention
that, you know, I've had the God bless the
[SPEAKER_00]: blessing of knowing the Willie Nelson
family for a little over 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my first conversations with
Willie back in the day and early on in
[SPEAKER_00]: this and he he said that, you know,
we will start saving the small American
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer the day that they can start growing
cannabis on their farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he was he was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just took us a long time to get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a place to start from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have one last question for you,
Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if so, if I'm if I'm a
person, a grower or a farmer that wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into hemp, do you have sort of a
pathway or any recommendations for someone
[SPEAKER_01]: who wants to start exploring that as a
potential field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the best place to start,
you know, is at least I know in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: and many other states are putting together
some really good information on their on
[SPEAKER_00]: their State Department of Agriculture
websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's always a I'd say
that's always a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're your regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to, you know,
go through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All roads go through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know Minnesota's, you know,
putting together a you know, has a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado does as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other national organizations
are great resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, both hemp and the HIA got some
great resources on on their web pages as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I, you know, kind of focus on
both and get to know your know your
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator and and then and then then move
into some of those those organizations and
[SPEAKER_00]: and and join the organization and and you
know, help support the cause because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're the front line of of
policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really appreciate your time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very helpful for me in learning
more about what's going on in the hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, good luck with your with all the
talks and speaking engagements that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have around hemp and everything you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided it'll be fun tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This conference is the key noted by by
Martha Stewart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have a chance to Ben Martha's here
this evening over over dinner about about
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get her in our space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Michael Bowman.
