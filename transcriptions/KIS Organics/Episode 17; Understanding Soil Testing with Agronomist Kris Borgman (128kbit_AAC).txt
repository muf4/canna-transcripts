[SPEAKER_01]: This week's podcast is all about soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, we dive into the
importance of soil testing, some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of soil tests and how to
understand and interpret the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest this week is Chris Borgman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris earned a bachelor's of science and
crop and soil science from Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: State University and has over 19 years of
experience in agronomy, field management,
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable programs surrounding
agricultural turf and natural
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is currently the president of agronomy
for Unibest International who are the
[SPEAKER_01]: makers of the soil savvy test kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ion exchange technology in these kits
has been utilized by large agribusiness
[SPEAKER_01]: companies like Wilbur Alice, McGregor,
Crop Production Services, Simplot and much
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris also manages a large family dry
lands and irrigated wheat farming
[SPEAKER_01]: operation in Eastern Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so today we're talking all about
soil testing and I want to start off with
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of your background,
not going too deeply, but just a really
[SPEAKER_01]: brief idea of how you got into this realm
and what your background is with soil
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, really my background started
out, I acquired or earned my bachelor's of
[SPEAKER_00]: science degree in crop and soil science
from Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: That degree had a turf grass emphasis and
so I really focused on turf grass systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there I graduated and became a golf
course superintendent and worked at a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple golf courses, built two golf
courses and grew them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last golf course I was at we built and
grew it in and I was there for about three
[SPEAKER_00]: years and in that time I met the owner of
Unibest International who has the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: savvy product that we'll be talking about
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was curious if I was interested in the
technology that he had and if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: applicable to turf grass and I was really
blown away by this technology that he had
[SPEAKER_00]: and the accuracy of this technology and
soil sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: He mentioned that he was looking for an
agronomist and I actually made a career
[SPEAKER_00]: change to come work for Unibest who
developed the soil savvy product and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been here for seven years, almost eight
years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so let's talk a little bit about why
someone would want to soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of actionable information does
it give you with soil testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so soil testing is really going to
give you the best opportunity or ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to manage the system that you're looking
to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be large-scale agricultural
systems or small-scale plot size gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: at home, potting plants, I mean,
you name it, but really we want a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test to give ourselves the highest
probability of achieving high quality or
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and so soil testing is a very
critical component of achieving both
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and yield in these systems that
we're managing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like to look at it as a way of
helping avoid making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soil testing will tell us essentially
what sort of excess is in deficiencies we
[SPEAKER_01]: have or things that might be building up
over time if we're reusing the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's personally, I think soil
testing is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could talk a little bit more
about the different types of soil tests,
[SPEAKER_01]: can you talk a little bit about,
you know, I know there's a bunch out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, can you just touch briefly on the
major ones that people may be familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major soil tests that are currently
offered to most of us are often through
[SPEAKER_00]: extension agencies but you might have
direct access to soil testing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These labs are going to offer chemical
extraction type soil tests and maybe paste
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our chemical extraction soil tests are
most common, especially in commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where they use different types of
weak or strong acids to essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: they apply these acids to your soil and
extract off the nutrients that are in your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil that may be available to a crop that
is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also paste extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These in simple would take your soil,
make it into a slurry and the paste
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions really look at the solution or
soluble forms of nutrients within your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really the two main,
the chemical extraction and the paste
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction are the two main soil tests
that are most familiar to most growers or
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm most familiar with the Malik 3
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that we typically use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I understand it, and correct me if
I'm wrong, what we're getting when we use
[SPEAKER_01]: that Malik test is we're getting an idea
of everything that's in that soil but not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily what's currently available to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with that saturated paste test,
that's telling us a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_01]: what is currently soluble and plant,
you know, more plants available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an accurate way of describing the
two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Malik extraction is going to be,
you know, an acid type extraction and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really dependent on the soil type that you
have and what extractions going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you the best idea of nutrient availability
in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different types of
Malik, the Bray, the Olsen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different types of
extractions and the accuracy of those
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions really depend on the soil type
that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often labs use certain extractions for
areas where most of their soil samples
[SPEAKER_00]: come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the paste extraction obviously is
going to give you a better look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble forms of that total amount of
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's actually soluble and in the
solution phase that would be available to
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's important for growers
to know what type of test that lab is
[SPEAKER_01]: using that they go with so that they know
if they're getting a Bray extraction or a
[SPEAKER_01]: Malik 3 extraction so that they can base,
have some sort of basis for those results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, once you've gotten results
from a lab, it's best to really stick to
[SPEAKER_00]: that lab and look at those results
compared to the responses in your crops
[SPEAKER_00]: and start to really, you know,
mesh those tests with your crop responses
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of stick with that lab that
you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good to change labs or send soils
to different labs because it really gets
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing to us as growers or agronomists
in trying to interpret these tests across
[SPEAKER_00]: labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But currently in industry, they recommend
that you stick with one lab versus trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to send your soil soils to all different
labs and see what responses or what
[SPEAKER_00]: readings you get from multiple labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've actually done that where we've
sent same samples to two different labs
[SPEAKER_01]: and gotten, you know, fairly similar but
different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the pH can vary by as much as
0.4 between these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen different calcium and magnesium
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree with you that it is
important to stay with a lab once you like
[SPEAKER_01]: a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, personally, we've been using the
standard soil test at Logan Labs because
[SPEAKER_01]: we've worked with Steve Solomon and Erica
Reinheimer and it makes it really easy if
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's using the same lab results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the one that I'm most
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen tests from all these other
labs too and they make these
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think for listeners, it's important
to realize that these recommendations are
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes based on certain crops or crops
that are different than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to know, are they making a
recommendation for turf grass or for
[SPEAKER_01]: potatoes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or for tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_01]: That can factor into how you interpret
these results as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you typically when you submit a soil
sample to a lab, if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations, they're usually going to
ask you what the crop is that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, maybe what the previous crops
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then usually, you know, they want
they're going to ask for a yield goal that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really drives recommendations in
commercial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, obviously, if we're not dealing with
commercial agricultural applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could probably still provide the crop,
say tomatoes, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a commercial crop as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could provide that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the recommendations may not be
specific to the systems that you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that'll lead into a little bit
about the soil savvy technology that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: offering and how we can help growers with
the specific systems and recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're that they're managing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to highlight a couple of things
that you've already covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to stay with the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you go with a lab, know the type of
test that they're doing and realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: these these test results are guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not written in stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your actual soil may be, you know,
within a certain percentage or close to
[SPEAKER_01]: the results that you're getting,
but not necessarily exactly those numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned, previously,
you really want to, you know, look at
[SPEAKER_00]: your, you know, look at your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're doing tissue testing,
stay on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing consistent, you know,
deficiencies and certain nutrients and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe you're picking those up on
the standard soil analysis and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to keep comparing those those
tests to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just your visual
observations of of your plants and your
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue samples in conjunction with that
soil test is going to start to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lead you in the proper direction and
nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing the same deficiencies
over and over again, obviously we need to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe amend these soils with
these specific nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, you know, we're not trying
to make up with foliar applications during
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that those nutrients
are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that plant starts to grow,
a lot of times plants will begin to adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: in quality and yield in deficient systems
and may not display all the deficiencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're going to start adjusting to it
based on the deficiencies in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always want to start with building a
good soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as an agronomist, you're not just
looking at the soil test, but you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at where your last crop finished
in terms of yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at what you're visually
seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, if the soil test showed
sufficient magnesium, but you're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium deficiencies, that may lead you
to believe that that magnesium may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: plant available or that you may still need
to do applications to get those levels up
[SPEAKER_01]: or adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not just looking at the soil
test, but they're another tool in your
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of your agronomist toolbox,
would you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use all the tools,
you know, and we've talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, chemical extractions,
paste extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about tissue sampling so far,
and then we're going to get into resin
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and what that's going to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all of these tools, and it's not
saying that, you know, one's maybe better
[SPEAKER_00]: than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have their place and fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're trying to do is just bridge
the gap between all of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: tools to help us manage these systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think another important factor is
the biological aspect of all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in organic soils, we're counting on the
microorganisms releasing these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the soil test that we talked about so
far, all of these tests sort of gives an
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of all of what's in the soil,
not necessarily what's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where having good biological
activity in the soil helps release these
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the biologicals, even in commercial
agriculture, logical agriculture becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the biggest sectors or increasing
sales are in biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really starting to realize,
even in commercial agricultural systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: that biologics play a huge role in soils
and keeping those soils essentially alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the more microorganisms,
the more activity we have going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: those soils, they're continually breaking
down nutrients, holding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a much better system than
having, you know, more of a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: fallow type system where you essentially
are not promoting that biological aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: of those systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dive in a little bit more about
the soil savvy test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I grilled you guys when I first found
out about your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really excited for the potential of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to just kind of go through some
of that conversation that we had,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, months ago in terms of some of
the questions I had about the soil savvy
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you give a little background into
what the test is and how it works?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the soil savvy test really started with
the foundation of what we call our ion
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange resin technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This technology was acquired by our
company out of Montana State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, we've spent most of our time
in commercial agriculture building the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation, the baselines for resin soil
testing and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we've done is after we've built
that foundation and got traction in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, we really moved into more
specialty type systems all the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're offering what we're calling
soil savvy, which is more for our
[SPEAKER_00]: independent gardeners, our homeowners,
that need access to a soil test that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can read, they can understand,
they can interpret.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also provides them with an
actionable item, a recommendation for both
[SPEAKER_00]: an organic or synthetic fertilizer to help
them, you know, with their cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the base of soil savvy,
the soil savvy test kit really came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when we look at the turf grass
applications that are available with soil
[SPEAKER_00]: savvy, those came from golf courses,
sports turf fields, all that data that
[SPEAKER_00]: backs that up came from these
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just moved that to make it
available to the homeowner or the local
[SPEAKER_00]: landscaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of applications for this
soil savvy product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, the way it works is like
an artificial or synthetic root in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of you're putting the soil into a tiny
container with a little gel like resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the resins themselves are in what we
call a resin capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Tad mentioned, this is essentially
mimicking a plant root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that our system works is that
these ion exchange resins can only absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients from the soil if it's in a form
available for plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have nutrients in your soil and
they're not actually in a form available
[SPEAKER_00]: for plant uptake, say they're tied up,
your phosphorus is tied up with your
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium or your pH is reducing the
availability of your phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: the resins are really going to account for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talked about our standard soil
analysis or chemical extractions,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really telling us, OK,
this is what's in our soil, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily mean that those nutrients are
going to form available for plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have the resin test that's going
to tell us the actual available portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: our nutrients in our soil that are going
to be available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost like taking a tissue test
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of data that correlates what
we see in the soil with the resin test
[SPEAKER_00]: back to tissue concentrations in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost like taking a tissue test,
but in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also on the predictive side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're predicting an excess of a nutrient
or a deficiency of the nutrient in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil prior to even planting a plant or
starting a cropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the ability to go in and amend
that soil or build it to what we need
[SPEAKER_00]: based on nutrient availability of that
particular soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you mentioned tissue testing
because that's something that with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is not available to, I'd say,
95 percent of the growers out there
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the fact it is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having the ability to get something
that will offer similar results as tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: testing in a form that is affordable,
but also easy to access, I think is really
[SPEAKER_01]: a handy tool for growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you mentioned, the Malik test or
the Logan Labs test that we've been using
[SPEAKER_01]: is the standard soil test will tell us
everything in the soil more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: In an idea of what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the soil savvy test will tell us
what's currently available out of all
[SPEAKER_01]: those nutrients into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it really doesn't matter how much
total calcium I have if not enough of it's
[SPEAKER_01]: in a form that the plant can actually
uptake it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that note, let's talk about ways you
could utilize this test to actually make
[SPEAKER_01]: some good changes in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, for me, I love the idea
that knowing if I get a bumper crop with a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular cultivar that I'm growing,
I could test that soil and set that as my
[SPEAKER_01]: benchmark standard for future crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if my next crop isn't quite as good,
I could do another test and know
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively quickly, oh, my manganese
levels have dropped off and maybe that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference or my calcium levels are
lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever particular micro macronutrient
has changed, I can make relatively quick
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments to that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I think that's a great way to
position the test with and within those
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always comparing back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've mentioned this many times just in
this podcast that we're always watching
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants and we're always comparing that
back to our analysis of our soil that we
[SPEAKER_00]: currently have available and making those
changes, even though the analysis might
[SPEAKER_00]: not come back and tell you the exact thing
you need to be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As managers, we're continuing to compare
what we're seeing and make adjustments as
[SPEAKER_00]: we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of adjustments, the other way I
thought this test would be really handy
[SPEAKER_01]: would be I could take a test, a soil savvy
test, apply a particular fertilizer or
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient, and then do another test,
say a few days later, a week later,
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_01]: At whatever point in time frame,
I want to know how available that actual
[SPEAKER_01]: application had been to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing that in agriculture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an unlimited amount of fertility
products out there on the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have claims that they do certain
things or provide the best nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: availability, but we really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we apply those nutrients to the soil
or those biologicals, we haven't been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to really quantify those effects of these
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the resin technology,
we can take a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at our baseline soil before an
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can apply either a biological or
certain nutrient package that is available
[SPEAKER_00]: to you guys that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can apply it to the soil, wait a little
bit of time, maybe a week or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: come back, soil test again, send that in,
and look at the efficacy or the value of
[SPEAKER_00]: that nutrient that we applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that nutrient in your specific soil
type isn't the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make adjustments to determine
which products are really the best for the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil types that you're growing your plants
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing I wanted to touch on for
me was what was the big difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: saturated paste tests and this soil savvy
test then, because they're both
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially telling you what's soluble or
more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the features of the soil savvy test
I like was that this artificial resin or
[SPEAKER_01]: root sits in the solution for five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's giving us a little more accuracy
of what's breaking down and available over
[SPEAKER_01]: that time period rather than just a
snapshot of what's available right when
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab technician is doing that saturated
paste test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any other differences there that
you'd like to highlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, just a high level of thinking of
the two different testing methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our saturated paste essentially is going
to tell us what's in the solution phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're adding water, they're spinning
that sample, and they're taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution and looking at what's in that
solution phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin technology or the soil savvy is
going to look at what nutrients are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution phase, but it goes beyond that
because once the nutrients are absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the solution phase by the resin,
it then starts to exchange for available
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients on exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes beyond just that snapshot of
what's in the solution phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to tell us, okay, once we've
absorbed nutrients from the solution
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, what's that soil's ability to
continue to provide available nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: once we have absorbed it from the solution
phase?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the resins are very
dynamic and seeing what the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going to see in that soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we absorb from the solution phase
and then we go and absorb from the cation
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange sites on the soils and we know
what that soil 's ability is to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to provide available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing that I forgot to mention
earlier that I get asked a lot are about
[SPEAKER_01]: these home soil test kits that you see at
Home Depot or your local garden center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any comments on those?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I have some thoughts, but I thought
I'd let you go first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I haven't spent, I know Bren and
our VP of New Market Development here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Unibest has spent a little more time
looking into those systems, but they're so
[SPEAKER_00]: general in what they provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even pH testing, you know, at laboratories
still today, as Tad mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can vary, you know, almost a half a pH
unit depending on the lab and how they do
[SPEAKER_00]: pHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can only think that the variability
in a home test kit for pH and other,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, even NPK can be highly variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the level of, you know,
soil testing and management of where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: at today, I just don't think that's gonna
be enough to provide us with actionable
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I found these home kits to
be very inaccurate personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we won't sell them at our farm and
feed store or garden center because I just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think they give us good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you mentioned, these tests,
you know, they're doing all right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna see a color change sometimes,
so you're being asked to interpret a
[SPEAKER_01]: color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really challenging in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys have a lot of expensive,
you know, equipment that you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me to spend $25 to $30 on a
soil test and send it into a laboratory
[SPEAKER_01]: that's gonna have a technician that's
trained on interpreting the results and
[SPEAKER_01]: also using much more expensive lab
equipment than I can afford at my,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in my garden to interpret those
results I think is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving on here, now that we've kind of
covered your test, and also these other
[SPEAKER_01]: types of soil tests and the way they can
be used, can we talk a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: about what someone might see on a soil
test in terms of what these, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what these different categories or numbers
are and what they really mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit more about what
pH is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so on the soil test, I guess we'll
kind of transition more to speaking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil savvy test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any test, when we talk about
nutrients, a lot of times you're gonna see
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH or the percent hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're also going to see parts per
million values, parts per million of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different things
you're gonna see on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess first to talk specifically to pH,
what we're looking at is the percent
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a reverse logarithm of the
amount of hydrogen in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about it, the more
hydrogen that you have, free hydrogen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil or on exchange sites,
that's going to decrease your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the less hydrogen you have,
you're going to have a higher pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pH is really, you know, the first
thing that we want to tackle when we look
[SPEAKER_00]: at a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your pH is, you know, either high or
low, that's one of the first things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to adjust before we start to
tackle, you know, some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients So if we have a low pH,
for example, you know, maybe we're down at
[SPEAKER_00]: five or 5.5 pH, you know, that's pretty
low for most of our plants with the
[SPEAKER_00]: exception of, you know, blueberries,
azaleas, rhododendrons, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can be at those lower pHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thrive at those lower pHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of our crops do the best,
you know, between a six and a seven pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if our pH is low, you know,
we're really gonna want to look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some liming applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lime is essentially calcium carbonate
that we're adding to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to help, you know,
kick off some of these free hydrogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of those hydrogens and increase
our pH in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a soil test that comes back
with low magnesium, you know, and our pH
[SPEAKER_00]: is low, we might want to use a dolomitic
lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to have your magnesium
component in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have low pH and low magnesium,
you'll want to use a dolomitic lime
[SPEAKER_00]: because that'll help you increase your
magnesium as well as increase your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at a soil test,
that's one of the first things I look at
[SPEAKER_00]: is what is the pH of my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just by adjusting pH alone,
you can also make more nutrient available
[SPEAKER_00]: that wasn't available at that lower pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we increase that pH, we can increase
nutrient availability and that might solve
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of our deficiency problems alone
just by adjusting pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about, I guess, low pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do we do for high pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're gonna want to use more
ammonium type products, ammonium sulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: or similar products, because now we want
to add these hydrogens and these
[SPEAKER_00]: acidifying components back into the soil
to decrease the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the same way as we did with the low
pH, we might increase nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of certain nutrients that
weren't available under the original pH
[SPEAKER_00]: regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pH is a very good place to start with
your soil test and really get that
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced before you start to tackle your
macro and micro nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'll post the pH availability
chart, which is sort of what you were kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of discussing there as you were talking
about pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can see at what levels things
are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that's interesting too is,
as you mentioned, certain things are more
[SPEAKER_01]: available at certain pHs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some things at lower pH are more
available that you don't actually want,
[SPEAKER_01]: like aluminum, for example, or some of the
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping the pH above certain levels is
really important as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a really complicated topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people obviously go to school
for a long time for this and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff we're still learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going really basic into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of I'll put up other
resources for people who want to read
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other aspect of pH that I just wanted
to mention is I've seen some good research
[SPEAKER_01]: showing that the plant can actually buffer
the pH in the rhizosphere based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: exudates it puts out to select for certain
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've heard that the pH can vary a fair
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how you can get plants that can
survive in, you know, less than optimal pH
[SPEAKER_01]: ranges in terms of the soil test,
but they can still thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen any research on this
yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can adjust for certain environmental
conditions, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: One caveat to that saying they might not
be thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may just be managing, you know,
to get by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't, you know, just think that
the plants can adjust to these things
[SPEAKER_00]: because everything that plants having to,
you know, give out or those plant
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates, you know, those are all being
created, you know, through light,
[SPEAKER_00]: through sunlight, you know, that all have
to be transferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all processes that take energy
to do that, to buffer out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the offset these soil factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really want to still focus on the
soil, but that is correct that plants can
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust for some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, obviously in the cannabis
industry, we have a very great opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to really get these soils exactly where we
want them, you know, especially with the
[SPEAKER_00]: resin technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really wanted to also talk about,
you know, the value of the resin
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about all these chemical
extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about pH and how complicated
all of these components are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which extraction is the best one?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: The great thing about the resin technology
that we've developed is it's accounting
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of those things for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of doing that work for you in a
sense, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH of your soil is going to tell you
what nutrients are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resins are going to absorb those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes some of that work or that
thought out of thinking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: which extraction is the best or what
nutrients are actually available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like to think of the resin as
doing a lot of that work for us that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to figure out in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we move on to some of these other
topics, some of these things that I'd like
[SPEAKER_01]: to cover are not necessarily on the
SoilSavvy test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm actually looking at a Mailek 3
test right now on my screen too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just kind of want to cover both.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ones that they offer you too is
your organic matter percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk a little about what that
number tells us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so our organic matter percentage is
an important factor in our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, really it's tied to ability
of soils to hold water or certain percent
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture is really tied to the amount of
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really controls, say, the amount of
irrigation that we can apply at one time,
[SPEAKER_00]: the holding capacity of that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also tied to nutrient holding
capacity and more cation exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of organic matter as you
increase, it's going to have the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold on to more nutrient, the ability
to release more nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If our microbial populations are good,
it's going to continually break down this
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter and release more nutrient
into our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having organic matter in the soil is
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, when we get into our sandier
soil systems, typically they have less
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have less ability to hold water,
nutrient, and those systems are a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit tougher to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the downside of too much organic
matter also is that organic matter can tie
[SPEAKER_00]: up nutrient very readily and make it not
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you apply these nutrients that we
talked about, these products, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance that in some soils, that organic
matter could tie that up immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may become available over time as
it gets broken down by this microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: population, these organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may become available over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're managing the life cycle of a
plant in a very short period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to be working with nutrient that's
more available, more readily available
[SPEAKER_00]: into that solution phase in that short
amount of time that we're managing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to try and manage nutrient
that's going to be available in a year or
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to manage nutrient that's at
immediate availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing about organic matter
percentage too that I found is,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're dealing with a lot of people
using potting soils, is that high level
[SPEAKER_01]: can break down over the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may have 20% less soil at the end
of your crop cycle than when you started
[SPEAKER_01]: because the microorganisms are breaking
that material down toward the humification
[SPEAKER_01]: of that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's important to account for that
if you plan on reusing your soil to
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that you're going to have a lot
less soil come recycling time if your
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter percentage is higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any of these potting soils are going
to be a lot higher than, say, a field or
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're typically trying to get organic
matter percentage above 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get up into 10%, you're rocking
from an agricultural perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a potting soil perspective,
that's very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of already jumped into the
next one that I want to talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is cation exchange capacity or total
exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see it as CEC or TCEC on soil
tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of already touched on it,
I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important component and one
of those components that we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: and what the resins are kind of telling us
as far as nutrient availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our CEC or our cation exchange capacity
is a measurement of the amount of nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: or exchangeable sites on a particular
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are negatively charged sites on a
soil particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as kind of a scale or an idea of
high CEC soils versus low CEC soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: a clay-type soil, because of the type of
soil, the amount of surface area on a clay
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to have the most negative
exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's going to have ability to hold
on to a lot more of our positively charged
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, our calcium, our potassium,
our magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the ability to hold on to a lot
more of that at one time, essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: versus our sandier soils are going to have
a low cation exchange capacity or a low
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of negative exchange sites to hold
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important in how we load
soils with nutrient and their ability is
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually hold that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we mentioned in a sandier soil,
I might not be able to put as much
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient down at one time because I don't
have the exchange capacity to tie up or
[SPEAKER_00]: hold those nutrients on those exchange
sites versus a higher organic matter or
[SPEAKER_00]: CEC soil, like with clay, you're going to
have a lot more exchange sites to hold on
[SPEAKER_00]: to a larger amount of nutrient at one
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very important measure of your
soil and its nutrient holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Tad mentioned, in commercial
agriculture, we're trying to shoot for
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five percent organic matter on
those soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the systems that you guys are
managing with potting soil, those
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages are going to be much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that and CEC is going to allow you to
load those soils much more upfront and
[SPEAKER_00]: have the ability to carry it out through
the life cycle of the plant versus lower
[SPEAKER_00]: CEC soils and lower organic matter soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always look at your CEC levels of your
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that is really tied to CEC too,
and I think everybody should ask for this
[SPEAKER_00]: test is a base saturation test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very critical test because
this is going to essentially tell us the
[SPEAKER_00]: balance of bases in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the balance of our calcium to
our magnesium and to our potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the availability of those nutrients is
very much tied to that base saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, typically on a good soil,
when we look at a base saturation
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement, about 75 percent of our base
saturation should be calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 75 percent of those exchange sites
roughly should be taken up or occupied by
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: About four to seven percent of those
exchange sites should be occupied by
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the remaining exchange sites
should be occupied by our magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is usually around,
you know, 12 to 15 percent or so of those
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you guys get a test, the base
saturation is very critical because
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the balance of those
nutrients on that exchange site is really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to determine the availability of
those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have too much calcium and magnesium
on those exchange sites, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have very low base saturation number for
potassium, which is a very key nutrient in
[SPEAKER_00]: most of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so look at that base saturation
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get familiar with those numbers if they're
offered to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do that on the soil savvy test,
but this is one reason why we want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: all the tools that are available,
you know, at Unibest or soil savvy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not saying to not do a standard soil
analysis because we've talked about the
[SPEAKER_00]: critical components of these tests,
the base saturation, the CEC, these
[SPEAKER_00]: components that we don't offer with just
the availability test at soil savvy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use these tools in conjunction with one
another, as we mentioned, to give yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: the best opportunity to manage these
soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I like to think of CEC
sort of as a giant sponge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little bit of a double-edged
sword in the sense that with a soil with a
[SPEAKER_01]: low CEC, it's not going to take very much
nutrients to fill that sponge,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then it's not going to hold as much
nutrients either, so we're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to apply nutrients more frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas something with a high CEC,
it's going to hold a lot more nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's going to take a lot more to fill
that sponge as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to keep that in mind,
too, when you're looking at your cation
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, really high is not necessarily
a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means you have to manage that soil
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in terms of base saturation
percentage, you know, I've read a few
[SPEAKER_01]: different books on the subject,
and everyone sort of has a slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: different idea of what they call an
optimal level or optimal range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know currently I'm reading a book by
Neil Kinsey, and he likes to have calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: around 68% and magnesium at 12%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on your crop, your potassium
levels may vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to run potassium a little bit
higher with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that base saturation percentage,
essentially, what percentage of that
[SPEAKER_01]: sponge is what nutrient?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you mentioned, you know,
high calcium can cause less magnesium or
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things all interact together,
and there's really relationships between
[SPEAKER_01]: these different nutrients, and it gets
really, really complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is still well in my head,
and I'm still learning a lot myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there'll be relationships between
zinc and another nutrient or iron or
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, and there's all these levels
and relationships that get very
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything you want to talk about
in that regard, or do you want to move on
[SPEAKER_01]: to the next thing on the soil report?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like you said, everybody,
there's kind of different ranges for these
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one of the things that Tad
just mentioned is, you know, potassium in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis system, just like in,
you know, tomatoes, is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of ranges for potassium are
often too low for these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at nutrient levels for
potassium, it might say that you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: range for potassium in the range for that
specific lab, or even our soil savvy test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might say that you're in the range,
but I would say that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis, you're going to want to be
at the high end or even above that range,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know that cannabis has a high
demand for potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to actually be at the
higher end of that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let the ranges totally dictate,
you know, where you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might come back that you're
sufficiently deficient, but you could
[SPEAKER_00]: still see deficiencies in your tissue
samples that you take, or just visual
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because it's saying that you're
in range, but maybe a lot of that
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium is not available, or you just
need to continue to increase the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium to displace some of that
calcium, magnesium, because you need more
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium for that specific crop that
you're managing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where those levels might be fine for
another crop, we needed to manage the high
[SPEAKER_00]: demand nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of my second thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: After pH, we want to look at our
macronutrients and see, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what our macronutrient levels are,
you know, and that really leads into,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, potassium looking at our NP and
K levels and, you know, where those levels
[SPEAKER_00]: are at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I have a plant that requires a high
amount of a certain nutrient, we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: address that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really good point that you
bring up there that these recommendations
[SPEAKER_01]: are, like you said, just they're
guidelines and we need to adjust them for
[SPEAKER_01]: our specific crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition, traditionally,
these recommendations by an agrologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: by a lab to a farmer would be just enough
to get that crop to grow for an optimal
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not trying to necessarily build
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as an organic farmer, as we're trying
to reuse the soil and have this high value
[SPEAKER_01]: cash crop, our recommendations may we may
want to vary our guidelines based on that
[SPEAKER_01]: and actually put a little bit more into
the soil or try and do a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: to build the quality of the soil for
successive, you know, successive
[SPEAKER_01]: generations of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Chris, one of the other questions I
had was that you don't see nitrogen on,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, for example, the Logan lab standard
soil test, the Malik 3 test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little about why that might
be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think a lot of times we don't get
a nitrogen measurement, maybe unless it's
[SPEAKER_00]: specially requested on a test because a
lot of times if a grower is doing like a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-plant soil sample, usually they're
looking at nitrates only in most of these
[SPEAKER_00]: tests and they typically may assume that
those nitrates are going to be readily
[SPEAKER_00]: lost or leached out of the system by the
time you get to growing the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might soil test, you know,
two or three months before the actual crop
[SPEAKER_00]: goes in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would assume that most any
nitrates and most systems may be lost
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to the crop going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times they may not offer
the nitrate test unless it's maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically requested.
[SPEAKER_00]: One good thing about the soil savvy test
is we're going to give you a measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: of nitrate in your soil, but we're also
going to give you a measurement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of ammonium in your soil that's
going to be available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, ammonium has been a lot tougher
nutrient to analyze for with the standard
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis methods, but it's very easily
absorbed by our resins and our resin
[SPEAKER_00]: blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to give you the nitrate and
ammonium portions of nutrient in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important to kind of
managing the ratios of those nutrients to
[SPEAKER_00]: one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't want to be leaching or
pushing a lot of nitrates through our
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can also build up nitrogen levels
with ammonium, which can be held on
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not near as leachable as our
nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to balance out the amount of
nitrate to ammonium in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot more, a lot of the organic soils
tend to have more ammonium, higher
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium levels than nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just look for that on the soil savvy
test and see what your balance is of these
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen components and try and balance
those out because we don't really want to,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though we're a lot of times indoor
and potting systems, we're not pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrates through and into the environment,
we could be recycling them even.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't want to waste them and push
them through if we don't need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at the balance of your nitrate to
your ammonium in your soil savvy results
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, excess nitrates is a big problem
with the cannabis industry in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing to algal blooms and other
problems with our groundwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can optimize or even limit the
amount of nitrogen that we're using,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only does it save us money,
but it's a lot better for the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of leads me to my next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were a cannabis grower and you
were looking to utilize soil testing and
[SPEAKER_01]: were reusing your soil, say in the ground
or in raised beds, how would you go about,
[SPEAKER_01]: what would your protocol be for that sort
of a thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, what I would do is,
you know, at the end of the growing time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would obviously put all these soils in
one place, composite these soils all
[SPEAKER_00]: together really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would pull a soil sample or two and
look at, you know, where our nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are at, you know, even run a
standard soil analysis and see where our
[SPEAKER_00]: organics at now, where our base
saturations are, where our available
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient levels are, run these tests,
get an idea of where they're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now we're going to have a
baseline of that soil after it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we could actually rebuild
that soil by knowing what our target
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient levels are and Soil Savvy is
going to give you a general recommendation
[SPEAKER_00]: or guideline of how we could do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could come back and once again
introduce our biologicals and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: rebuild this soil after we've already
grown a crop in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think about it just pre,
you know, pre plant and end season,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also after season and recycling these
soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can give me your comments on this,
but for me, I like to know everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use that, that Malik 3 test at the
end of a cycle to find out all of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: still left in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that Soil Savvy test could be
taken at the same time as a way to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what's currently available for that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to plant right back into it and
then I could amend that soil and retest
[SPEAKER_01]: prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what people need to keep in
mind is they think of soil testing as an
[SPEAKER_01]: expense, but we're talking about a really
valuable crop here where it could save you
[SPEAKER_01]: tons of money down the road with such a
high value crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't afford to have crop loss in most
cases with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's too much money thrown down
the drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spending, you know, 50 bucks,
a hundred dollars, couple hundred dollars,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on your scale on the soil test
to get you that information I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that you touched on was,
you know, mixing all that soil together in
[SPEAKER_01]: one place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of our growers may be growing
different cultivars in raised beds,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, or in the ground where you're
not necessarily going to be able to move
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil or re-homogenize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about taking samples
from different beds and then just using
[SPEAKER_01]: that as a general guideline for where your
soil's at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think people should be sampling
every bed if they're going to be slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you land on that topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're managing each bed
differently, I think you'd want to sample
[SPEAKER_00]: each bed alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing the same thing across
multiple beds, you can go ahead and just
[SPEAKER_00]: take soil cores or portions of soil from
each of those beds and then composite them
[SPEAKER_00]: together in a bucket with your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good composite of that soil and
that's going to give you a good
[SPEAKER_00]: representation of all of those beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you're managing the beds
differently for different characteristics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to want to test them
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some good examples on how to
take a soil sample online.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a couple of points I want to hint at
is that you want to go down at least six
[SPEAKER_01]: inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important to use either,
you know, I guess you could use your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like to use a plastic shovel or a
core sampler because if you use,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, for example, a rusty old hand trowel,
you're potentially adding a lot of iron to
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's little things you want to think
about, too, when you're sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And making sure that you're getting an
accurate mix or sample of your given soil
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you can get a more accurate
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to introduce other factors
into your soil test that might throw it
[SPEAKER_00]: off, such as a rusty soil probe or shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that's clean because
that could definitely throw off your
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's critical for professionals
that are doing this all the time to invest
[SPEAKER_00]: in a soil probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them online very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, invest in a soil probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a critical tool, I think,
to have in anybody who's managing a
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, as we get into potted
plants, say we're in season during the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing time and we want to test midway
through the season, see where our levels
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you know, you might want a smaller
diameter probe that's not going to pull as
[SPEAKER_00]: big of a core, you know, out of the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe take multiple, take a core from
multiple pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want a smaller diameter core when
we do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not, you know, disrupting a ton
of rooting mass as we pull that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: sample out of each of the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have a, at work, I have a
core sampler and then I also have a
[SPEAKER_01]: compaction tool that's like, it looks like
kind of like a super scaled down,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I don't know, maybe a jackhammer
shape that you push down into soil and it
[SPEAKER_01]: tells you how much, you know, PSI or
pressure you have as you go down so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can see how much soil compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of really fun, you know,
little tools and gadgets out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: can help you in analyzing your soil better
and making, you know, actionable decisions
[SPEAKER_01]: about how to manage your soil fertility
and manage your soil better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might throw one other kind of idea
or concept in there to think about when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're soil sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, with the cannabis stuff,
we really like to build that soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, prior to the plant going in and
get our levels for most of our nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we go into planting and
afterwards in season, we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand, say, maybe we put some slow
release or some coated fertilizer prills
[SPEAKER_00]: or some type of prills in that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to understand, you know,
one, if we have those prills in there when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're taking the soil sample, because one
of those prills can really throw off a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could come back very skewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more we can build our soil up front
and then if we need to test in season,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have those big prills and stuff
in that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to avoid any of those type of
things that are going to skew your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's usually pretty obvious when you
hit those type of things, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get, you know, just huge numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are, you know, off the chart or any
scale because one prill of anything can
[SPEAKER_00]: really throw off a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, be aware of your management
system, where you've placed nutrient and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to avoid, you know, those large,
those prills if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think building the soil up front is
really going to give, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best results for most of our
macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might manage nitrogen in season a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think building that soil up front is
really key.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say prills, I assume you're
talking about something like Osmocote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sort of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, you know, we're big proponents on
this podcast of getting people to go
[SPEAKER_01]: organic, to really build their soil and
consider it their biggest resource on
[SPEAKER_01]: their farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of what you're saying just really
speaks to sort of our philosophy around
[SPEAKER_01]: farming and gardening and cannabis
cultivation in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I just want to say thank you for
taking the time today to chat about soil
[SPEAKER_01]: testing and I'll be sure to put up some
more information, including that pH
[SPEAKER_01]: availability chart, some sample test
results, and links to the soil savvy test
[SPEAKER_01]: and website information, as well as some
good resources that people want to dive
[SPEAKER_01]: further down into all of this soil testing
and books they can check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your time, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it and look forward to
talking to you again soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Chris Borgman with Unibest
International, makers of the soil savvy
[SPEAKER_01]: test kit, which we currently have
available on our website for only $30 with
[SPEAKER_01]: free shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kits come with a self-addressed
envelope with prepaid postage,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's super easy to take a sample and
send it into the lab for results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage everyone to look into soil
testing as a way of improving both the
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility of your soil, but also as a way
of increasing yield and reducing plant
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some places like King County here in
Washington State offer three free soil
[SPEAKER_01]: tests to every homeowner and while these
tests are basic in information they give
[SPEAKER_01]: you, it is a good starting point and your
local extension service may have something
[SPEAKER_01]: available too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to the cannabis
cultivation and science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget that there's more information
and articles available on our website and
[SPEAKER_01]: blog at www.kisorganics.com, as well as
links to the data and information we
[SPEAKER_01]: discussed in this episode on the podcast
page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you enjoy these podcasts,
please take a moment to leave me a review
[SPEAKER_01]: on iTunes or send me your feedback and
suggestions through our website contact
[SPEAKER_01]: page or tad at kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
