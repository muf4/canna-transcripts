[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_03]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_03]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're catching this episode near the
time of release, I wanted to mention two
[SPEAKER_03]: upcoming events that I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I will be speaking in the cannabis
breakout sessions at Biocontrols USA
[SPEAKER_03]: Conference in Portland, Oregon March 4th
through 6th along with Suzanne
[SPEAKER_03]: Wainwright-Evans and Justin McGill,
two of my former guests on the podcast and
[SPEAKER_03]: good friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can sign up on the website at www
.biocontrolsusa.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other event I want to mention is the
Cultivation Classic also in Portland,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great event for those interested in
organic cannabis cultivation and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: looking forward to attending and
supporting it again this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please check it out at cultivationclassic
.cc.
[SPEAKER_03]: My guest this week is Paul Coxon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul has been working with plants since
2008.
[SPEAKER_03]: His love for plants was a lifelong passion
that developed and grew through the
[SPEAKER_03]: Nebraska Master Gardener program and
through his involvement with Huebner's
[SPEAKER_03]: Nursery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul received his Bachelor's of Science
from NC State during which time he
[SPEAKER_03]: published five journal articles,
received the International Society for
[SPEAKER_03]: Horticulture Society for Horticulture
Science Young Minds Award, say that 10
[SPEAKER_03]: times fast, published over 20 extension
and outreach publications, and published
[SPEAKER_03]: three e-books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul has a passion for scientific
investigation with the end goal of
[SPEAKER_03]: providing growers and producers with
applicable and impactful production
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge and practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul is currently pursuing his Masters of
Science in Horticulture at NC State under
[SPEAKER_03]: the direction of Dr. Brian E.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whipker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Paul, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's go ahead and start off giving
listeners a little bit of your background
[SPEAKER_03]: and how you came into this role that you
have at the university.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have always been interested in plants
ever since I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were a passion of mine and that
passion just kind of grew and evolved over
[SPEAKER_01]: my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was involved in the Master Gardener
program, went to numerous extension events
[SPEAKER_01]: and just through kind of a roundabout way
ended up at North Carolina State
[SPEAKER_01]: University and I actually got my
bachelor's here and started working with
[SPEAKER_01]: plants under Dr. Brian Whipker doing
floriculture work with him and continued
[SPEAKER_01]: working with him through my bachelor's and
the opportunity came for me to sign on
[SPEAKER_01]: with a master's for him and I'm currently
a year into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been one wild ride and never expected
to be doing work with cannabis but here we
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you told me a little bit about that
off air and how you guys applied for a
[SPEAKER_03]: license and were able to get one and have
started doing some research with cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: or more specifically hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to talk a little about some of
the papers that you've, there's some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the research that's happened at your
university?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the way that we got involved in
cannabis is kind of a roundabout story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Whipker and I were just kind of
talking one day in the greenhouse just
[SPEAKER_01]: shooting the breeze and I joked with him
and said, hey, let's work in hemp because
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp had just become legalized in our
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of laughed at it and then a few
months later he contacted me and was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I've just applied for a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be doing work with hemp and
ever since then it's been just one crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: research project after another and it's
opened a lot of amazing doors for us so
[SPEAKER_01]: we're really glad that we got into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as some of the work that we've
done, we got into cannabis and normally
[SPEAKER_01]: when you are looking at researching a new
area, you jump on and you'll do a
[SPEAKER_01]: literature review and look at published
literature and I got on and jumped on
[SPEAKER_01]: Google Scholar and typed in cannabis
sativa and I think I used the all in title
[SPEAKER_01]: function and I got 12 results and it was
then that I knew that we were in for one
[SPEAKER_01]: wild ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we basically had to start at the
foundation as far as research goes because
[SPEAKER_01]: we wanted to establish some baselines for
nutrients, for lighting, for growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: pH work, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how we got started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go more into the specific projects
that we've done if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you tell us about your first
foray into cannabis research and just for
[SPEAKER_03]: listeners to let them know, I do have one
of your papers in front of me,
[SPEAKER_03]: the characterization of nutrient disorders
of cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll probably spend a little more time
on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be kind of flying blind on
questions as I don't have the access to
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the first things that we did was
starting from the ground up, basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the soil up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two first projects that we started
doing, we were looking at optimal rooting
[SPEAKER_01]: through colonal cuttings because we
realized quickly that sourcing through
[SPEAKER_01]: seed was just not the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started clonally propagating
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were experiencing a huge variety of
rooting habits and successes when trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to root cannabis clonally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the floriculture industry,
we've had a long time to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: standardize things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that variability that we're seeing
really intrigued us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the first two studies we did,
we did a rooting study and that has been
[SPEAKER_01]: published.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at the use of bottom heat and
also the diameter of the cutting,
[SPEAKER_01]: the caliper, looking at how those two
factors would impact rooting bigger and
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next piece of work that we
did was looking at optimal substrate pHs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was in tandem with another lab
here at NC State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing work there, the substrates lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those were kind of the foundation that
we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, we kind of went into
the nutrient deficiency work that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: in front of you, trying to characterize
nutrients and nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've also had another study
published where we went into lighting and
[SPEAKER_01]: photo period a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at daylight extension,
lighting regimes versus night interruption
[SPEAKER_01]: of lighting regimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I should back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very first study that we did was a
baseline hemp nutrients leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: survey, because we had no idea what
optimal nutrients were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we traveled around the state to
different growers' operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we took samples off of their plants
and sent them into the lab here,
[SPEAKER_01]: NCDA, and got some values back and
established the baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that work has also been published.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I kind of want to talk about the
findings from each of these, because I
[SPEAKER_03]: think they're all really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's start with what you were just
describing there in surveying and
[SPEAKER_03]: establishing ranges for cannabis using
tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about the methodology of that
and that process and how you determined
[SPEAKER_03]: what a healthy plant looked like?
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of those ranges?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was kind of the dirty mucky
science that very few scientists will
[SPEAKER_01]: actually want to reveal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very foundational work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, when you're dealing with
a new crop or a new discovered crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of a shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the reasons that we went through
multiple different locations to try and
[SPEAKER_01]: find healthy plants is because fertilizer
types were different, and growing
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions were different, and the
management strategies were different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irrigation was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that introduced a lot of variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were trying to homogenize the
landscape by taking a general survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is not to be used as kind of like
the golden rule of this is what adequate
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf tissue parts per million looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The survey was just meant to be more of an
informational guideline to growers saying
[SPEAKER_01]: that these plants, which appeared healthy
and were grown vigorously, had adequate
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what we can infer from other
crops, they appear to be within the
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that work then kind of springboarded
into the nutrient disorders work,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is getting closer to establishing
fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the most important
sustainability guidelines for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially what you're saying is you
don't want people to draw too many
[SPEAKER_03]: conclusions from your preliminary work
there, that paper, other than to see that
[SPEAKER_03]: there may be a possible range here of
elements in the tissue that may allow you
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow what appears to be a healthy
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So science is a very additive process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more and more experiments you do
in a specific research direction or
[SPEAKER_01]: research question, they begin to add
together to form the whole picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that, then you can start
inferring and making guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting close with some of the
work that we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, cannabis is still very
new for research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're still just beginning to gain
traction with the research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a really good point that
you're making there so that people will
[SPEAKER_03]: consider how this may point them in sort
of a direction of a trend.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's still so much research that
needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you were talking about an
established crop like corn, you'd find
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of papers just on nitrogen that
could discuss this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of tissue work that's been done
across a variety of different scenarios
[SPEAKER_03]: and environments to where you can start
really drawing strong correlations.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we just don't have any of that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's still very preliminary,
like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have Dr. Kaplan, Darren Kaplan on
from the University of Guelph.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did work with Dr. Zang on propagation
already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I don't know, did your work come
before or after their paper, which was
[SPEAKER_03]: released in, I think, May of 2018?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is there any correlation there or any
anything that you found that sort of fit
[SPEAKER_03]: or didn't fit with the work that they did?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kaplan's work came before ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ours was just published at the end of I
believe it was 2018 is when ours came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So his work came before ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as the the correlations between
the two works, there were some
[SPEAKER_01]: similarities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, we were also
exploring slightly different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for example, he used rooting
hormones in his work and we did not look
[SPEAKER_01]: at rooting hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were looking more at the caliper and
bottom heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you say caliper, just for people
who may not be familiar with the term,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking about the measurement of
the diameter of the stem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you say sorry, so you were
measuring you're measuring the caliper in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of the rooting success of that
particular cutting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, when in flower culture,
when you're trying to establish a more
[SPEAKER_01]: vigorous cutting, a vegetative cutting,
you'll apply heat to the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tray or bottom of the bench or close to
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that increases the temperature of the
substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does is it helps speed up
the rooting process in some species.
[SPEAKER_01]: In others, it will have little to no
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were trying to explore that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other area that we were
exploring is the caliper, which when you
[SPEAKER_01]: take a tip cutting from another stock
plant and you kind of take the tip portion
[SPEAKER_01]: and you point it away from yourself and
you look at the end that you cut it and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you were to measure the diameter of
that, that would be the caliper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the theory was that a thicker caliper
could potentially have more surface area
[SPEAKER_01]: for the callus to increase root
proliferation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a thicker caliper could also
potentially have more reserves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more photosynthates, et cetera,
that the plant could draw on to help with
[SPEAKER_01]: the healing and rooting process was kind
of the line of thinking that we went down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And did your research support your
hypothesis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we found was that we divided
calipers into three different sizes,
[SPEAKER_01]: small, medium and large, as far as the
caliper was concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did find that there was a
statistically significant difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting between the small caliper and the
large caliper, but not between the small
[SPEAKER_01]: and the medium or the medium and the large
caliper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what that means is that when we
actually looked at the date of rooting,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bigger rooting, and we actually then
screened the rootings through a visual
[SPEAKER_01]: scale, that the larger caliper produced
more vigorous roots when compared to the
[SPEAKER_01]: small caliper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you say large, I assume you're
still talking about fairly immature
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetative plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know that cannabis can develop a
woodier stem over time, which appears to
[SPEAKER_03]: inhibit cloning or propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk a little bit about how you
established your experiment and what you
[SPEAKER_03]: really were comparing there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to answer your question, how we kind of
went along the lines of exploring how to
[SPEAKER_01]: quantify the size of the cutting or the
caliper, we actually went into mother
[SPEAKER_01]: stock plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took some other stock plants and we
took vegetative cuttings off of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the paper goes into a little more
detail on how we quantified that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't bore you with the details here,
but we divided all of the cuttings,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of did a survey and looked at the
different calipers and the different
[SPEAKER_01]: caliper pools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that, we came up with the sizes
that we used for our study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the small size was 1.7 to 2
millimeters, medium size was 2.3 to 2.6
[SPEAKER_01]: millimeters, and the large caliper was 2.9
to 3.2 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of the general process
of how we approached categorizing what a
[SPEAKER_01]: typical caliper would be on our mother
stock plants that we were managing and
[SPEAKER_01]: then how we divided them up for the study.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, did you look at where on the plant
itself that the cutting was taken from in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of from near the top of the plant,
near the base of the plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that something that was factored in at
all in this particular study?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we only took from secondary,
tertiary, and quaternary branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically what that means is you have
the central stock from which all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: branches come off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's considered the primary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so any branch that comes off of that
would be secondary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any consecutive branch that comes off of
that would be tertiary, so on and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, the paper, which is
freely available through Murray State
[SPEAKER_01]: University, the Journal of Agricultural
Hemp Research, has a wonderful diagram in
[SPEAKER_01]: there on how we actually took the cuttings
and quantified the branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as looking at, say,
an interior canopy cutting versus an
[SPEAKER_01]: exterior canopy cutting, we were only
taking shoot tips from the exterior
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by a shoot tip is only the
terminal growing portion of a cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it terminated in a growing tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you weren't you weren't taking more
than one cutting off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of that branch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in theory, you could go down another
few inches and take another cutting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you didn't do that for this
experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there any other findings from this
particular study that you wanted to share
[SPEAKER_03]: besides what you just shared regarding
larger caliper rooting better than smaller
[SPEAKER_03]: caliper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, there was a statistically
significant difference between these small
[SPEAKER_01]: caliper and the large caliper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as the percentage of cuttings
that had rooted at 14 days versus 28 days,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a statistical difference in this
study between adding root zone heating or
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom heating versus not utilizing bottom
heating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was another interesting finding
from the study, rather.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your control temperature and then
what did you raise it to with the root
[SPEAKER_03]: zone to with the bottom heating and how
statistically significant are we talking
[SPEAKER_03]: across adding that heat matter or heat
source?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the what we did is we measured the
substrate temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the substrate temperature was twenty
seven point eight degrees centigrade
[SPEAKER_01]: without root zone heating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was sorry, that was with root
zone heating and the average temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: was twenty five point six degrees
centigrade without.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we increased the root zone temperature
by roughly two degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, just to save all of us Americans who
are terrible at Celsius, I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: this calculation for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So twenty eight point seven Celsius is
eighty three point six six degrees
[SPEAKER_03]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was your heated temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your sorry, what was the control
again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sorry, that's twenty seven point
eight degrees centigrade for the
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the treatment was twenty seven points.
[SPEAKER_03]: So eighty two degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the control, it was twenty
five point six degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when when doing a study like this,
you don't want to raise the temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: the root zone temperature too much because
you don't want to potentially desiccate or
[SPEAKER_01]: damage any roots that are forming or even
the callus as it forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why the temperature differential
wasn't overly large.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I I would have thought that maybe
the control temperature might have been
[SPEAKER_03]: lower rather than the heated temperature
be higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we this experiment was conducted
during the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were in a polyhouse and the cooling
coefficient on a polyhouse is much less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why the temperatures were a
little higher for the control.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's move on to another one of the
papers that you mentioned prior to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, prior to talking about this
nutrient disorder paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, are you the substrate pH work,
the other one that we did kind of on that
[SPEAKER_01]: ground up approach, we're still in the
process of publishing that paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one has not been released yet,
but those results will be forthcoming.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we do dive right into the
nutrient nutrient disorder paper that you
[SPEAKER_03]: wrote or co-authored.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, now, one of the things you talked
about with this paper was that you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: really are a team there at the university.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any anything you want to mention
prior to starting talking about or did you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to kind of as we go through the
paper, mention the people that were
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in different aspects of this
work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our lab, we have been really blessed
to have a group of fantastic researchers
[SPEAKER_01]: and collaborators that we've worked with
on all of these projects, both the
[SPEAKER_01]: projects that we have completed,
have published and are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, Gabby Brahas, Patrick Veazey,
David Logan, Matthew Davis, Kimberly
[SPEAKER_01]: McAllister, our collaborator, Dr. Nichelle
Schroeder-Moreno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our other collaborator, Dr. Brian Jackson
and my major professor, Dr. Brian Booker.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all form a fantastic team of
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these people have been involved on
all the projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others are collaborators on some projects,
but research definitely does not take
[SPEAKER_01]: place in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as the research process goes,
we've been really blessed to have some
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing collaborators and people in our
lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it really does take a team.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's important to recognize
that when you see a name on a paper,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not the full story of the work that
went into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for highlighting that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this paper itself, it's called
Characterization of Nutrient Disorders of
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was brought to my attention recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it only was published in October
18th of 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to give a quick highlight or
sort of a rough idea of what the abstract
[SPEAKER_03]: was with this paper and what your goals
were when you first started doing this
[SPEAKER_03]: research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, the first paper that we
published was that general survey paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one is published.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's meant to be kind of a shotgun
approach to guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were the ranges we saw in multiple
different cultivars across different
[SPEAKER_01]: growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is trying to be a little more
targeted and kind of narrow in on optimal
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility recommendations for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying to figure out what kind of
fertility cannabis plants need in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: balance the nutrient cost input to growers
and maximize the, you know, CVD content,
[SPEAKER_01]: flower content, depending on what you're
growing for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this specific work, we were looking
at nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that means is we were trying to
stress the plants down to a level where we
[SPEAKER_01]: could visually see symptoms of nutrient
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we could take foliar leaf tissue
and send that off to a lab and compare
[SPEAKER_01]: that to plants that we grew with a
complete fertility regime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that complete fertility regime is
based off of what's called a modified
[SPEAKER_01]: Hoagland solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a standard hydroponic water soluble
nutrient fertilizer regime that basically
[SPEAKER_01]: balances all of the cations and anions and
is supposed to provide a plant with
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that it needs as far as it's
macro and micronutrients are concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were trying to withhold an element
from a plant from that recipe to induce
[SPEAKER_01]: our deficiency and then compare those
visual symptoms and the leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis back to that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that plant that received everything
was our control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now are there, is there research out there
showing success and growing with this
[SPEAKER_03]: Hoagland solution or formula with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or were you kind of going into a little
bit of new territory with that in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: pulling from other crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Whitker, myself, numerous other
scientists have used the solution to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide fertility for a wide array of
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as specific to cannabis,
no, we were the first to kind of pioneer a
[SPEAKER_01]: Hoagland solution with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the general literature is
concerned, it has been tested on numerous
[SPEAKER_01]: different plants, numerous different crops
and proved to be adequate.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so and just out of curiosity,
so as you started growing with this
[SPEAKER_03]: Hoagland solution is this baseline for
fertility, just anecdotally, you found
[SPEAKER_03]: that it seemed to be providing appropriate
nutrient levels across the board for macro
[SPEAKER_03]: and micronutrients for for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so kind of how the research logic goes
is we took a broad survey approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our first paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we kind of wanted to see what
would happen if we took away a singular
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient from the plant and what that
would do to the leaf tissue values
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to the survey that we had and
what that would do to the control plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that was receiving adequate fertility that
has been proven to be adequate for
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple different crop species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then currently what we're doing and I
know we're getting off track a bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but currently we are then modifying the
Hoagland solution for all macro and
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients at different rates to try
and get a foliar leaf tissue curve,
[SPEAKER_01]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from, you know, say like zero parts per
million to two point five, so on and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth to try and establish a curve for
fertility as far as foliar analysis are
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just I was just kind of
curious where you came up with this for,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a baseline for your control,
because I think that's important for
[SPEAKER_03]: people to understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start talking about what you're
removing, it's good to know where you are
[SPEAKER_03]: starting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I want to get into a little bit
of the methodology here, but just I had a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of things in the introduction that
you guys mentioned in terms of relating
[SPEAKER_03]: back to prior work that had been done that
I thought was kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't know maybe it's something you
can touch on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just something that pretty much
the sentences that you put in there say at
[SPEAKER_03]: all, but I kind of wanted to bring him
bring him out in hemp fiber, in hemp fiber
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boska et al reported higher levels of
nitrogen, increased plant leaf weight and
[SPEAKER_03]: decreased leaf THC content, presumably due
to THC dilution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you touch on that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that work in particular,
like I said once when I actually went into
[SPEAKER_01]: this and was doing a literature review and
trying to get a good feel for the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: research that had been done, there was not
much out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this introduction is quite bare bones
when it comes to a normal introduction and
[SPEAKER_01]: literature review.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially what we're trying to say
there, and I think what the article was
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get out, is first I would like
to draw your attention to the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a fiber variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were growing a high CBD clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the growth habit and growth parameters
are a bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: For fiber varieties, you want them to be
very tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to plant them very densely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in a field condition typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the CBD varieties that we were
growing, you want those big beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more compact.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were grown in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially what we're trying to get
at here is to draw on previous work
[SPEAKER_01]: showing that nitrogen increased the total
production of leaf biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important when looking at leaf
tissue analyses, because you're comparing
[SPEAKER_01]: how much nitrogen is in that leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a larger leaf, you can potentially
have a dilution effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also that increased plant size could
have resulted in a THC dilution effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a larger bud, but the same
amount of THC in it, because most things
[SPEAKER_01]: are calculated off of a percentage dry
weight, you can have an artificially low
[SPEAKER_01]: dilution effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I am unsure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't recall off the top of my head
which methodology they actually used to
[SPEAKER_01]: test THC in this study, whether it was a
percentage dry weight or a percentage
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be really interesting for
people in growing hemp that are looking to
[SPEAKER_03]: stay below a given THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to have a legal crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be curious to see more research coming
out on that around nitrogen levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any research at this point is just gonna
help that additive scientific effect so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can get a clearer picture for
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so one other thing I wanted to ask
you about was at the end of your
[SPEAKER_03]: introduction, you mentioned that no visual
guides of nutrient deficiency in cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: supported with leaf tissue analysis in
documenting a progression of symptomology
[SPEAKER_03]: have been published.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially what you're saying there is
when I go online on Google images and type
[SPEAKER_03]: in nitrogen deficiency cannabis or
whatever particular element I'm looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for, there's no research that's been
published that actually correlates that
[SPEAKER_03]: with a tissue test, a leaf tissue analysis
to show that that truly is the deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Along with symptomology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So different stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know and have seen and was
able to tease out in the work that I did,
[SPEAKER_01]: there have been some leaf tissue analyses
reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the plant analysis handbook has
some tissue values for cannabis Tiva.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as correlating those visual
symptoms with an actual leaf tissue test
[SPEAKER_01]: and what I mean by actually correlating,
I don't mean just providing low fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we withheld nitrogen from the plant,
the plant received no nitrogen of any
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can say with relative certainty that
the symptomology that we saw based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf tissue analysis is truly nitrogen
deficiency because the plant received
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely no nitrogen fertility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's dive right into nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to get in too much into your
methodology.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all there in the paper if people want
to read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems fairly straightforward to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just talk about what your findings
were related nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So traditionally when you think of
nitrogen deficiencies, you think of a
[SPEAKER_03]: yellowing on the lower leaves,
the plants putting more energy into its
[SPEAKER_03]: upper leaves, lighter greening over all of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have some actual photos here
so people can see initial intermediate and
[SPEAKER_03]: advanced stages of nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: But can you talk a little about about
those findings relating to nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so exploring nutrient deficiencies
is kind of a fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you could call it a bit of a
puzzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain elements within plants are mobile,
and what that means is the plant has the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to remove those from certain
tissues and portions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And translocate them to other portions of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, nitrogen is noble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that means is when the plant is
nitrogen stressed, it will draw nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: from those lower leaves, which is why we
kind of drew upon the fact that the
[SPEAKER_01]: symptomology developed first on the lower
portion of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will translate locate that to the
other portions of the plant that need that
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for example, the meristematic
region as it's developing new leaves and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting on new shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and like you said, typical symptomology
of nitrogen deficiency is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: yellowing or paling specifically at the
lower foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other elements that we looked at,
you know, are immobile, which means you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to see symptomology on the newer
leaves, shoots, newer portions of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a really good point regarding
mobile and immobile nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: How related is that to the hydrology in
terms of your watering habits?
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of nutrient mobility or nutrients
that are mobile?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the the whole flow and dynamics
and flux of nutrients within the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: is much more complicated than we went into
in this paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we're trying to get some more
foundational knowledge out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, so for example, some plants are
taken up by the plant through a process
[SPEAKER_01]: called mass flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very much related to how much
water essentially the roots can absorb
[SPEAKER_01]: into the plant and get those nutrients in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's other ways that the plant
can obtain nutrients, scavenge nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as from this study, all of the
plants were on an automatic irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: system and received the same amount of
liquid at the same intervals throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that changed was which
nutrients we were supplying to those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in that solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, and one of your one of the things I
want to point out before we dive too far
[SPEAKER_03]: into any one element or nutrient here is
in a traditional cannabis growing
[SPEAKER_03]: environment, you're going to see multiple
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, it's not ever just a nitrogen
deficiency or a phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually related to your watering or
your environment, humidity, your
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature, your lighting intensity,
insect pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope listeners will keep that in mind
when they're utilizing a guide like this,
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's not as simple as just picking
out one of the photos and saying that
[SPEAKER_03]: looks the closest to like my plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have a little more history
into how that plant's being grown and
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going on in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to throw in that little
caveat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting back to it, when you talk about
nitrogen, one of your findings was the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants grown in nitrogen deficient
conditions produce 50 percent less biomass
[SPEAKER_03]: when compared to the control.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this was an interesting finding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it seems expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant doesn't have nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be able to grow as
efficiently, but you didn't find that
[SPEAKER_03]: across all of the different elements that
you were testing with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there anything in relation to
nitrogen that you want to touch on
[SPEAKER_03]: regarding that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we have done numerous nutrient
deficiency studies with multiple different
[SPEAKER_01]: crops and this trend of dry weights being
variable in their statistical significance
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of holds true across most of those
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is just dependent upon the
plants and how they uptake nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: how they utilize those nutrients,
their growth habits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can imagine something that stays in a
rosette form is going to have very
[SPEAKER_01]: different nutrient needs and utilization
than something that has a very upright and
[SPEAKER_01]: leggy growth habits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as nitrogen is concerned,
we expected to see a statistical
[SPEAKER_01]: significance between no nitrogen and
nitrogen-supplied treatments, specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: because nitrogen is a macronutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is the plant uses more
nitrogen and other macronutrients in
[SPEAKER_01]: greater quantities than, say, the
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both macro and micro are still needed by
the plant, but as far as the amounts that
[SPEAKER_01]: they need, it needs much, much,
much more nitrogen than, say, even
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus or potassium or calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the reasons why there
was such a strong statistically
[SPEAKER_01]: significant decrease in plant dry weight
when compared to the control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, in this test, you were just dealing
with vegetative plants, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you never really looked at cannabinoid
content, THC percentage, any of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: The current work that we're doing,
we are looking at, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrient rates for all macro and
micronutrients across the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: different life stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the experiment that we are doing now,
we're looking at leaf tissue nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations in the vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then, again, sample once we have turned
off our lighting and initiated those
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter days to start flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we harvest at brief flower,
which is typically a week to two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: after we shut our lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're waiting until they go into
full flower maturity, which we're
[SPEAKER_01]: targeting about eight weeks for full
flower maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're again, sampling leaf
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting this nice, not only
nutrient rate curve, but also total plant
[SPEAKER_01]: life cycle and how the nutrients are
changing, accumulating, moving within the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't an uptake study or a
translocation study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nutrient rate study over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, there's this additive
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the next step that we're
going on to, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that'll be really
interesting because it's fairly easy,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, to grow a healthy vegetative
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as you get further into flower,
as the plant starts senescing,
[SPEAKER_03]: any particular stress, I think,
becomes much, much more apparent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though, as we move through some of
these elements in your study here,
[SPEAKER_03]: you note that there isn't statistical
significance in biomass, I think as we
[SPEAKER_03]: move into flower, that'll become a lot
more apparent in terms of those
[SPEAKER_03]: deficiencies reflecting either a loss of
THC or cannabinoid percentages or
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenescent bean values or even overall
yield of flower biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really excited to see that work as
you guys come out with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of going back to what you were
saying with the statistical
[SPEAKER_01]: non-significance in the plant dry weights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, for phosphorus,
while we did not see a statistical
[SPEAKER_01]: significance in dry weight between the
plants that did not receive phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the plants that did, you can look
at the leaf tissue values and see that
[SPEAKER_01]: they were statistically significant,
very statistically significant actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though that phosphorus treatment
may not have produced a smaller plant per
[SPEAKER_01]: se, it definitely had less phosphorus,
which means that it will be stressed and
[SPEAKER_01]: will be as healthy and consequently could
potentially produce a bud that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: suboptimal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm of the opinion that most growers
over apply phosphorus in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be curious, are you going to look at
sort of what sufficiency levels are needed
[SPEAKER_03]: for phosphorus in flower versus the
overabundance that I think is applied
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the cannabis industry in
general when it comes to phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that we'll be looking
at is when we take that final leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be looking at,
okay, at the end of the plant's life,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much phosphorus did it accumulate over
these different rates?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we will also be looking at
cannabinoids, cannabinoids, however you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to say it, and how that can
potentially relate back to the different
[SPEAKER_01]: rates that we're applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, in our phosphorus provided
at let's say hypothetically 10 parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million, what would that bud total dry
mass be?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then what would also be the level of
THC or CBD or CBG in that flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'd love to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's move on to calcium.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like that's the next nutrient
that you talk about here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did notice that you put in dolomite lime
into your substrate to get some calcium
[SPEAKER_03]: and magnesium in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you touch on that and then also what
your findings were with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: With calcium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the rooting substrate that we use,
because these were vegetative cuttings,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, some of that did have dolomitic lime
amended in it, but those levels would be
[SPEAKER_01]: negligible on the scale that we're looking
at, especially as the plants continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow and there's more biomass and
consequently less calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that in the statistically
significant results from the leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration that we saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as symptomology for calcium
goes, calcium is an immobile element.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're looking to see calcium
stress or deficiency on your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be looking at the growing
tips, the newly expanded leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: the portions of the plants that are
actively growing and expanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So calcium, the plant isn't able to
requisition any calcium reserves from old
[SPEAKER_01]: cells or old plant parts and translocate
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you're looking at these new
portions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing with calcium is that
it's involved in cell wall stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically what happens when a plant
goes through a calcium deficiency is it
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot adequately develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see this severe distortion and
stunting that we saw and you can see in
[SPEAKER_01]: the photos as they progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the reasons that we were
able to see such beautiful, I say
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful, but if you're seeing the
symptomology, it's not beautiful and it
[SPEAKER_01]: grew off, but beautiful symptomology that
we induced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's quite dramatic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very apparent, which I think is what
you're referring to there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is great to see and you can see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It almost looks like it had a lot of light
stress, I think, in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was quite shocked with just how dramatic
it is, because it's funny, because in the
[SPEAKER_03]: in the cannabis industry, there's sort of
this old mantra that if your plant looks
[SPEAKER_03]: at all sick or deficient, you just apply
Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of become a running joke in
the cannabis industry of just put more Cal
[SPEAKER_03]: Mag on that product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in reality, I think it's rare we see
these sorts of calcium deficiencies that
[SPEAKER_03]: they do occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I don't see them as much with the
growers that I work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tend to see more nitrogen or potassium
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I really like seeing those
photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was really great to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there anything else about calcium that
you wanted to add?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that you're kind of describing a
little bit of how these nutrients work in
[SPEAKER_03]: a plant, because I think that's really
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate that, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're OK with it, let's move on to
sulfur and you can talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd like to touch on one more thing
on calcium real quick.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So calcium and boron will have very
similar symptomology, and they're both
[SPEAKER_01]: immobile elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the reasons, and we have
completed the micronutrients experiment
[SPEAKER_01]: run for that nutrient rates by life cycle
portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can talk a little bit about some of
the symptomology and results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not true results yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't run statistics yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't run statistics on the full
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because cannabis, once it initiates
its reproductive phase, that growing tip
[SPEAKER_01]: will become the flowering portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium and boron are extremely important
in that development, because when they
[SPEAKER_01]: finally initiate the reproductive cycle
and start producing that flower bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be at that growing tip that
you see across the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do have calcium or boron
deficiencies, you will not have a properly
[SPEAKER_01]: developing flower bud, because you won't
have a properly developing and expanding
[SPEAKER_01]: growing region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we saw that with our boron plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had almost no flowers produced on our
boron zero rate once we initiated
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, just because the plant was
physiologically encased and capable of
[SPEAKER_01]: expanding and growing, because it did not
have the structural components needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: build those cells and expand those cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people can go and view these photos to
see what Paul's describing here on the
[SPEAKER_03]: paper itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some great photos associated with
every one of these elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wanted to move on to sulfur next,
is that correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just keep working our way through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sulfur, again, it was one of those
elements where we did not see a
[SPEAKER_01]: statistically significant difference in
the dry weight between the plants that did
[SPEAKER_01]: not receive any sulfur versus the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when you actually look at the
leaf tissue concentration, it was
[SPEAKER_01]: statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants that received no sulfur had
much, much lower leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations than plants that received
an adequate level of sulfur fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I want to kind of go back to
what you said a bit earlier on making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that you take a holistic approach to
diagnostics in your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great that you said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf tissue analysis is just one way of
trying to tease out problems that you may
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you said, it's this holistic
approach that you have to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be another abiotic stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be ozone damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be water stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking those leaf tissue concentrations
from your plant, actually going in,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the leaf tissue sample,
sending it off to a lab, ensuring that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do that and that the lab is licensed
and that the laws and legalities in your
[SPEAKER_01]: state allow you to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: To gain this information will be extremely
valuable if you think you have a nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You always want to go that extra step if
possible and check to ensure that what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're seeing visually is also reflected
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's an interesting topic because
cannabis is federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We cannot ship any leaf samples even if
they're of a vegetative plant with zero
[SPEAKER_03]: THC content in the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most cannabis facilities are very
limited in their ability to do tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of what we do is soil testing
because we're primarily working with
[SPEAKER_03]: organic soil growers where we have certain
levels of mineral content in every soil
[SPEAKER_03]: mix that we're working with or native
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's just a matter of trying to
balance those based off of a Malik 3 test,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is not ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fully aware of that, but it's one of
the limitations within cannabis research,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least from a facility perspective,
because we are limited not only just in
[SPEAKER_03]: the ability to mail leaf samples to reach
a lab, to even find a lab that's willing
[SPEAKER_03]: to look at a cannabis sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also just the cost associated
with testing for businesses is really
[SPEAKER_03]: tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's great that the university is doing
work like this to at least allow growers
[SPEAKER_03]: to have access to some of this
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we're learning as much as we
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So honestly, the exchanges that we get
with growers and the kind of challenges
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're experiencing, it only helps
us do better research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows, maybe down the road we're
going to look at possibly correlating some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the nutrient work that we're doing to
some of those soil tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's researchers out there
who do a lot of work with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they jump at the opportunity
to do some work like that if it's needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'd love to see more correlation
there between the Malik 3 and saturated
[SPEAKER_03]: paste tests with these tissue tests so we
can have a better idea of how we're of
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient availability in these soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the other challenge there,
too, is how much of those nutrients are
[SPEAKER_03]: really available to a plant and how well
is the biology at cycling those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we're talking about organic systems,
there's so many variables involved that it
[SPEAKER_03]: gets quite complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's going to be a long time
before we have all those answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by using chemical nutrients or mineral
salts like you guys are, you're really
[SPEAKER_03]: able to isolate out these various minerals
or nutrients, which really makes a
[SPEAKER_03]: difference in seeing these symptoms so
that we can still apply some of this
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge towards our more complex organic
soil systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing I will say with sulfur that
I see is I tend to see it in very high
[SPEAKER_03]: levels in organic soils, primarily because
people are either applying sulfates or
[SPEAKER_03]: gypsum as a way of mitigating the
alkalinity of a lot of the cations,
[SPEAKER_03]: in soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tend to see excessively high sulfur
levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, from all the research I've found,
it's very hard to reach sulfur toxicities
[SPEAKER_03]: in soils, or more specifically in cannabis
plants, to where I haven't really seen it
[SPEAKER_03]: be a big issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been one of the best tools for
lowering pH that I've found in soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you would touch on
regarding that comment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very difficult to produce a
sulfur toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without going too much into the
details and physiology of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially, the plant is very good at
requisitioning, utilizing, or excluding
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur within the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that you can see, and some
things that have come out of literature,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that elevated sulfur levels,
just like any other element being elevated
[SPEAKER_01]: above others in the soil profile,
can potentially impact, and I will qualify
[SPEAKER_01]: that by saying can potentially impact the
microbial community, especially in,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, an organic system like what you're
working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at how those microbes can take
those nutrients and turn them into a
[SPEAKER_01]: mineralized form that is plant-available,
that relationship between the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, the microbes, and then the
production of those mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: plant-available forms is a very important
network and web to be maintaining and
[SPEAKER_01]: monitoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So down the road, maybe there could be
more work done specifically with regard to
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes and, say, elevated sulfur levels
and new nutrient cycling in organic
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what I would like to see regarding
sulfur is information on how sulfur
[SPEAKER_03]: impacts soil biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when we talk about sulfur,
it comes in a lot of different forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we talk about a sulfate form,
where we talk about potassium sulfate,
[SPEAKER_03]: calcium sulfate, in the case of gypsum,
it appears to have, and this is anecdotal,
[SPEAKER_03]: very little minor impact on overall soil
biology and nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've heard when using agricultural
sulfur, which is associated with lowering
[SPEAKER_03]: pH, it can have a more dramatic impact on
soil biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I haven't seen enough research,
and I haven't seen enough data to really
[SPEAKER_03]: show how much sulfur would need to be
added to lower a pH level this much in a
[SPEAKER_03]: given volume of soil and how that impacts
soil biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are things that I would love answers
to down the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if that research exists, someone send
it to me because I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some research like that would be
fantastic, especially with regards to
[SPEAKER_01]: organic forms of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, there's definitely very
much need for more information to help
[SPEAKER_01]: perpetuate that additive scientific
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, but let's go back and why don't you
tell us a little bit more about magnesium.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I got off topic there for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium is involved with chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a plant experiences magnesium
deficiency, chlorophyll essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't function in the way that it's
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means for the plant is if
you have a magnesium deficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: the photosynthetic activity of the plant
could be much lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will impact the resources and
photosynthates that the plant has and is
[SPEAKER_01]: able to then throw at the developing bud
and other developing portions of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think about it in a typical life
cycle, you know, every organism wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially in plants, as you touched
on a lot of times with the reproductive
[SPEAKER_01]: stage of the plant, you'll experience much
more pronounced stressors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be when you start seeing
those symptomologies for nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies or other stresses that the
plant may be experiencing because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: dumping so many of those resources into
that developing flower bud with the end
[SPEAKER_01]: goal of trying to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so especially magnesium, you can
potentially have huge impacts to your
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, like I said, we have not
explored the full rates and life cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis yet of this element throughout
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's one of those that you want to
keep a specific eye on given its
[SPEAKER_01]: importance to plant health overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also touching on the symptomology
by location on the leaf and how it
[SPEAKER_01]: develops and progresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, they're very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium and potassium deficiency
symptomologies are very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so understanding that leaf anatomy and
how it progresses, you know, is important
[SPEAKER_01]: in the visual diagnostic checklist that
you kind of go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, in an ideal world,
we would identify nutrient deficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: early before it gets to these advanced
stages so that, you know, we don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: wait until we see advanced symptomology to
determine magnesium versus potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm excited to talk about potassium
because I think potassium is one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: most important elements when we're talking
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't have the data to support this
yet, at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have, you know, hundreds of soil
tests I've looked at relating to overall
[SPEAKER_03]: plant growth, but they're not having a
plant tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the trend that I think I'm seeing is
that potassium deficiencies occur at a
[SPEAKER_03]: much higher rate in cannabis, as in they
need more potassium than most agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think potassium has a high
correlation with bud density and overall
[SPEAKER_03]: weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially talking yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on the soil tests that I see
correlating with plants, the plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: appear to be, or soils that appear to be K
deficient or even just K sufficient,
[SPEAKER_03]: like barely sufficient, tend to produce
lower yield and lower weight and overall
[SPEAKER_03]: lower yield and lower bud density than
plants that have what most we consider an
[SPEAKER_03]: excess of potassium.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd be curious to have you talk on it
and also talk about what your findings
[SPEAKER_03]: were with potassium in this particular
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the interesting thing about potassium,
especially with regards to say a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: profile, as opposed to some of the soluble
fertilizers that we were using here,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's a monovalent ion, which means it's
charged is it essentially has a charge,
[SPEAKER_01]: a positive charge, a singular positive
charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically what happens, say you have a
heavy rain event, those monovalent ions
[SPEAKER_01]: will be leached through the soil profile
more readily than say your divalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that means that potassium can move
into a plant relatively easily,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it also moves through the soil
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively easily as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's kind of a side note.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as the research findings that
we found, we also found that limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium had a huge impact on the,
obviously it had an impact on how much
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium was taken into the plant because
there was no supplied.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it was supplied, the potassium
levels were quite high.
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we referenced our survey values in the
paper as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were within the reference values
that we have in our initial study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would agree with you that more work
definitely needs to be done in potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as its role in bud developments,
and etc, as you touched upon, I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: uncomfortable addressing that given we
have not yet explored the potassium rates
[SPEAKER_01]: in the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once we do, that's definitely
something that I will be specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for and comparing in our study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's extremely helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see that because what I so
I'll get from a grower, a malic three
[SPEAKER_03]: test, for example, at the beginning of the
growth cycle, and then one at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I find is, in terms of how far
the nutrients have dropped in the soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, nitrogen and potassium are the
two that see that typically appear to drop
[SPEAKER_03]: the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you mentioned, they are very
mobile, they could be being leached out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the soil from a flooding event.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of the guys that we're working
with to are using blue mats, which are
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially an automated watering system
that only waters as that soil dries out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's controlled through osmotic
pressure by the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we tend to not have a lot of
leaching going on through that bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in theory, if nothing's leaching out
the bottom of the bed, then that that
[SPEAKER_03]: potassium is being taken up into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we see potassium levels drop to,
let's say around 5%, or lower of the total
[SPEAKER_03]: cation exchange cc of the of the total,
the total plant, or sorry, total of what's
[SPEAKER_03]: available in the soil, I start to see
smaller buds lower yield, that sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to see research on that and
see what really is going on there in the
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf tissue itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to keep that in mind when
looking at the study when we run the
[SPEAKER_01]: macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we ran the micronutrients,
we have yet to run the macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to talk more with you just off
air about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually very fascinating,
especially if they're using a blue mat
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could potentially mean, well,
we can talk later.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can speculate about that later.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you hearing me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to your micronutrient
disorders, because you had some
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting stuff going on there,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so like I said, one of the the
nutrients that I'd like to specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight would be boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that is involved in the
essentially cell wall development and
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so especially if you experience a
boron deficiency, and then you're close to
[SPEAKER_01]: your initiation of reproduction,
and you don't remedy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, one thing that we saw is we
have little to no flower bud formation due
[SPEAKER_01]: to the fact that the meristematic region
was not able to properly develop and
[SPEAKER_01]: expand into the developing flower bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as I guess we can talk about
copper, was there a specific one that you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to address?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think the overview you're giving is
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will just caution listeners that when
we're talking about these micronutrients,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're talking about very, very small
amounts, typically parts per million.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need a lot of boron for a plant
to be sufficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, don't go out there and buy
borax and apply a bunch to your soil and
[SPEAKER_03]: think you're fixing a deficiency because
you'll probably kill your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to highlight that for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about micronutrients,
we're talking about typically pretty small
[SPEAKER_03]: levels of nutrient that's actually needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a fantastic point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to add to that, in this experiment,
we added a boron toxicity treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially what we did is we took that
modified Hoagland solution, we took the
[SPEAKER_01]: boron levels and we increased them tenfold
of what the Hoagland solution requires.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did that with manganese as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we do that is because we
often see, like you said, it's very easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to over apply a micronutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also wanted to try and capture some
of those toxicities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's what's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking through these photos right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: A boron, initial boron toxicity looks
almost exactly like your initial potassium
[SPEAKER_03]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's interesting for people
because I've seen people walk into a grow
[SPEAKER_03]: room, look at a plant and immediately say,
oh, that's nitrogen, oh, that's potassium,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that always makes me nervous because
there are there's so many variables
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of especially in soils,
a lot of your nutrient deficiencies and
[SPEAKER_03]: excesses can be related to hydrology or
the way that you're watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: By just under watering your plant,
you can cause a lot of nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: deficiencies because the microbes aren't
able to cycle nutrients effectively due to
[SPEAKER_03]: a lack of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So or due to lack of osmotic pressure,
move those nutrients throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's really important to
highlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point that out while we're
while we're on the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find one of the most helpful things you
can ask any grower of any crop is first
[SPEAKER_01]: and foremost for a crop history,
because most of the times you're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: something that is an issue that was
created some time in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is now manifesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a fantastic point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad to see that there's other
people out there who are stopping and
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking and taking a more holistic
approach to diagnosing issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there anything else you want to touch
on regarding the manganese or boron
[SPEAKER_03]: toxicities that you saw or either of those
elements in general in relation to plant
[SPEAKER_03]: growth or plant health?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I will say is when looking at
toxicities and you can see this in the
[SPEAKER_01]: photos and I hope that this photo also
gets posted so that listeners can
[SPEAKER_01]: reference it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will often see that toxicity
symptomology, regardless of element,
[SPEAKER_01]: follows a very specific progression where
you see that marginal chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that yellowing of the margin first,
and then it will progress to the marginal
[SPEAKER_01]: necrosis, which is that burning or that
the browning of the leaf margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see that and you can see that
in the comparison image that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: between manganese toxicity and boron
toxicity, that the marginal symptomology
[SPEAKER_01]: is very pronounced in almost any toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of as a side note,
being careful and cautious when dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with the leaf margin, especially if it's
going chlorotic or necrotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's excellent advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't something I was aware of or
had really ever thought of, honestly,
[SPEAKER_03]: when I think of toxicities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad you pointed that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to move on to what looks like
iron and zinc were the next two on the in
[SPEAKER_03]: your paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can move on to iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, as I stated, magnesium toxicity
or magnesium deficiency, manganese
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency, iron deficiency, they all kind
of have this interveinal chlorosis
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms that develop on the foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, doing work like this,
we're trying as best we can to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: these criteria and checklists,
both visually and with leaf tissue to help
[SPEAKER_01]: people diagnose things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of times the symptomologies are
very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being careful that when you're looking
at these, that you're taking, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: a holistic approach and trying to utilize
the tools that are available to you to
[SPEAKER_01]: help diagnose these.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you'll get this severe interveinal
chlorosis in those more advanced symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, you know, we can identify
and remedy iron before it gets to this
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But letting the plants go out this far,
that's one of the reasons that we allowed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the plants to grow in these
deficient conditions for so long so that
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd have that gradient and beginning
intermediate and advanced symptomology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as iron is concerned,
it is another immobile element.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this particular element,
if you're seeing symptomology on the new
[SPEAKER_01]: expanding leaves, the growing portions,
the plants, the portions of the plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: are actively growing, this is where you're
going to be seeing that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: interveinal chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so looking at where on the plant these
symptoms are occurring will help you
[SPEAKER_01]: identify and, you know, kind of utilize
that as a checklist, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: is this iron or is this, you know,
a mobile element.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some wonderful charts online
that you all can utilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just look at nutrient mobility in
plants, it will tell you which there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some charts out there that have,
you know, categorized mobile elements
[SPEAKER_01]: versus immobile elements, and will help
you identify more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tool, a diagnostic tool that you
can utilize to figure out which element
[SPEAKER_01]: you may be experiencing, which nutrient
may be limiting in your fertility regime.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think you covered it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you want to touch on regarding
zinc or I see you mentioned even
[SPEAKER_03]: molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have done zero work on molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't know much about it overall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you want to share in
particular relating to either of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we utilized molybdenum because it is
a plant essential micronutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as plants that often display
symptomology and molybdenum deficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, molybdenum is more
important for nodulating plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: so plants that will
[SPEAKER_01]: form associations with bacteria to form
root nodules to fix atmospheric nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as your lagoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for example, poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poinsettias will often display molybdenum
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of threw it in just for fun to
kind of see what would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, and you can look at the
composite picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much symptomology occurred and we did
not have statistically significant
[SPEAKER_01]: differences in dry weights, even though we
did receive a statistically significant
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in leaf tissue concentration of
molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically there was more molybdenum in
the leaf tissue in your treatment versus
[SPEAKER_03]: the control.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, that didn't display visually or
in terms of your overall biomass when you
[SPEAKER_03]: measured the two plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like from what I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I will say is because we use
things like kelp meal and rock dust,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never really worried about
molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figure we're picking some up through
those because they contain some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: elements.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll be curious to see as you move
through flower, looking at molybdenum,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you start to see statistically
significant differences in overall yield
[SPEAKER_03]: or cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be interesting because I'd like
to maybe start playing around with the
[SPEAKER_03]: addition of molybdenum to see if it has
any real growth impact or plant health
[SPEAKER_03]: impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's definitely something that
we'll be looking at with regard to our
[SPEAKER_01]: statistical analysis on the micronutrient
study that we just completed, the rate
[SPEAKER_01]: over life cycle experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these micronutrients, it's going to
be very interesting to see what happens
[SPEAKER_01]: with the different rates over the life
cycle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think you covered all my
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some of the discussion explains
some of your findings, which really fits
[SPEAKER_03]: with the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we already covered most of that
just in our discussion of the elements.
[SPEAKER_03]: But was there anything else you wanted to
add regarding this research?
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we sign off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just again, to reiterate that one of the
most valuable things you can do whenever
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking at a problem is utilizing
the tools that you have available to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at what you did in the past to try
and figure out is, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: you used water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I providing enough water and is that
causing a nutrient issue de facto or did I
[SPEAKER_01]: apply something that may now be
interacting in a negative effect in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil profile and causing another element
to be plant unavailable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this work, we're still in a
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're learning, we're producing science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an additive process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visual symptomology is correlated to leaf
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: These pictures are very helpful and
useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, some of the symptomology is
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the progression of the
symptomology, comparing that to the
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures and then also looking at where on
the plant those symptoms are occurring
[SPEAKER_01]: will be extremely useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to seeing further research
out of your university and you personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really grateful for your time today
and I look forward to staying in touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, we'll get to have you or one of
your colleagues back on soon to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the latest research and some of
your findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're definitely very excited for a
lot of the research we're doing and
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely even more excited to continue
talking with growers and producers to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the needs that they have as far
as research is concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much a two-way street.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the industry needs and does and the
issues that they're experiencing help us
[SPEAKER_01]: do better research that's more applicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bilateral exchange is extremely
important and definitely is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to continue in greater quantity for
all researchers that are going to be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: work in hemp or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Paul Coxton and you are listening
to the Cannabis Cultivation and Science
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
