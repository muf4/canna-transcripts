[SPEAKER_00]: So I just finished making a video about
Logan Labs, which is attached to the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say it's a longer video,
but please watch the whole thing so you
[SPEAKER_00]: really understand the context of what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to state that the information
I'm talking about in the video only
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to the saturated pace test,
not the May like three test and that I do
[SPEAKER_00]: have the utmost confidence in Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure to work with them all
of these years and I plan on continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with them for years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're a wonderful lab and I
really do appreciate what they do for our
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Tad here with Kiss Organics and
I wanted to talk to you about Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting around August of last year,
we started to see a bit of a discrepancy
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil testing reports that we were
getting and that the numbers were
[SPEAKER_00]: reporting a little bit higher,
specifically cations, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorides, sodium, sulfur, and major
cations like magnesium, potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we weren't quite sure what was going
on with that and had reached out to Logan
[SPEAKER_00]: and they weren't really sure what the
issue was and I know Bryant Mason was also
[SPEAKER_00]: working on this as well and basically they
figured out what it was and I want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: credit to Bryant Mason at soil doctor
consulting as well as Logan as to solving
[SPEAKER_00]: this because it's a little bit challenging
and I want to explain exactly what was
[SPEAKER_00]: going on and what the implications are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was happening was starting about
last August, the ICP machine that they
[SPEAKER_00]: used for these soil tests, it gets
calibrated and it gets calibrated using
[SPEAKER_00]: two different solutions and the
calibration solutions, they have a low-end
[SPEAKER_00]: solution and a high-end solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the low-end solution, I think Bryant
mentioned it was around 4 ppm,
[SPEAKER_00]: was fine but the high-end solution,
the one that I think is traditionally 200
[SPEAKER_00]: ppm, was actually off quite a bit and
because of that it was pushing these
[SPEAKER_00]: results higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had an actual, you know,
in-situ soil top soil for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you wouldn't have seen really a lot of
change in results but if you were running
[SPEAKER_00]: a really fertile living soil like a lot of
us do, that's where you start to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers jump up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it took a long time to figure that out
because they kept recalibrating but they
[SPEAKER_00]: were recalibrating with the same solution
and they didn't realize it right away,
[SPEAKER_00]: which to be fair is totally
understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the implications of this are,
are that if you got a soil test done
[SPEAKER_00]: between August to mid-March, because this
situation has been corrected and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: found out about this in detail as of last
week, so this is all brand new to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but those numbers should have dropped back
down into the proper range and the test
[SPEAKER_00]: should be more accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your test result was during that
time period, you might have seen some
[SPEAKER_00]: elevated numbers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is you might have under
applied nutrients, which is really a best
[SPEAKER_00]: case scenario for something like this,
you can always add more but it's harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: take away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have under applied nutrients
for a run or you may have gotten a
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation to flush for chlorides or
sodium where you might have been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get an extra run in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to be really clear,
we're talking like maybe a 20-25 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in total cations that we were
seeing, so our soluble salt levels and EC
[SPEAKER_00]: would look higher, but it's not like if
you had 100 ppm of chlorides traditionally
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden you're going to see a test
that shows 400 and you're flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably what it means is you might have
had one more cycle, you might have been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get in before flushing if you were
borderline already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long story short, the issue has been
corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I just found out about the
actual solution last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to that I'd had conversations with
Liz and Trinity and Susan over at the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Bryant about it, but we didn't
really, no one really knew what was going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you'd reached out to me prior to
that, I might have just said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to the lab, we don't know if
there is an issue or what's going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're just seeing slightly higher elevated
numbers, but now we do know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem was and I'm really grateful to
know the solution and know that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: moving forward with an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to be really clear that this is
not a problem unique to Logan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some stuff that Logan does
actually really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, they do QC where they
recalibrate their machine every 20
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most labs don't calibrate that frequently
or use a much higher frequency rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also are part of some accreditations
that require them to be very accurate and
[SPEAKER_00]: they always pass those with flying colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still believe that they're a high
quality lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that their soil tests are
something that we can trust and are the
[SPEAKER_00]: best tool, agronomic tool for us to use to
make data driven decisions about our
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility in our gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to be clear that this
issue could have been an issue in any lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not unique to Logan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a situation where we just had the
wrong calibration, but I am excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear that moving forward they're going to
do even a further QC step, quality
[SPEAKER_00]: control, where they're going to be
anonymizing the data and then looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: averages over time to make sure they don't
see any jumps over a period of a month or
[SPEAKER_00]: a period of a quarter that would indicate
that something might be off with the
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery in terms of calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're taking all the right steps to
correct this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that did discover,
I know there were some very vocal people
[SPEAKER_00]: around this that were convinced that there
was some stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in a sense you were right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your numbers would have been overrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reported slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would estimate around 20% to 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope this is helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to get this information out
and let people know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reach out if you have any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach out to me, you can reach out
to Bryant, or you can reach out to Logan
[SPEAKER_00]: directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did just record a podcast that I'll be
releasing soon between Bryant and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we go into even further depth on
this topic as well as a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So appreciate everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
