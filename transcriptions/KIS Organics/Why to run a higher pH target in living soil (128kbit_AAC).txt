[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, so I've done posts in the past about
the importance of pH in organics and
[SPEAKER_00]: organic soil and why it's necessary for
optimizing plant health and for optimizing
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today what I want to talk about is why
I prefer a higher pH target than you
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in hydroponics, you may aim for five,
five to six range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other soil companies may aim for like six,
six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very common aggregate
ergonomic target for actual soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for what we call living soils,
these potting soils with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have closer to neutral range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my target is six, eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the commercial growers mix,
which is very similar to our biochar soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just turned these under canopy airflow
fans off because I didn't want the noise
[SPEAKER_00]: while I was recording this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the plants are quite
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just starting to flower in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a six, eight pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen healthy plants up to like
seven, one, seven, two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point I would like to start
making adjustments to pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a reason we run a higher pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reason number one, biggest reason,
heavy metal uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get to lower pHs, you're going
to see higher availability and nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake of arsenic, lead, cadmium,
and aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below five, five, you'll actually get
aluminum toxicity and it'll block
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and availability of other
essential minerals that the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important to run a higher pH from that
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a regulatory reason,
because you're trying to pass in the state
[SPEAKER_00]: or just for your own health, we want to
limit the uptake of these sorts of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's reason number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason number two, bacteria prefers a very
neutral pH in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So running six, eight to seven is going to
allow for really good growth of microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: communities in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially with cannabis, it really
likes to have good high bacterial levels
[SPEAKER_00]: from what I've seen with my own microscopy
and the other research I've seen done by
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another good reason to run a
higher pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last reason is a lot of what
I try to do when I'm formulating soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: cram as much nutrients in there without
getting our soluble salts levels too high,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also stay within optimal pH range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the minerals and nutrients
that I want to be adding are cations,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means they have a positive charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of the inputs are going to be
alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like biochar, for example,
that I want to put into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by having a higher pH, it allows me to
put more cations into the mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows me to add more fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a balancing game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to add so much that we're
getting osmotic shock in the root system,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also want to get as much in there
as we can to allow the plant to have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to it and limit the amount of
touches and other products or inputs that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're adding throughout the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my room right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't added anything but water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did one microbial tea and that's it so
far this cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have any plans to add a lot
more of anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'm just going to let this run
with water through the rest of the cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my spiel on pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to leave any comments below with
your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for checking it out.
