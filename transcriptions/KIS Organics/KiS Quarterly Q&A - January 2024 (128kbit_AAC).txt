[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Chad Hussey, owner of KISS Organics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I host a cannabis cultivation science
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got started because my parents owned a
plant nursery growing up and then my
[SPEAKER_06]: father, when they sold that after 30
years, they started a compost tea
[SPEAKER_06]: business.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been around sort of plants and soil
biology pretty much my whole life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I came into it after coming back from
Australia with a master's degree.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got back into the business and kind of
been going from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the most exciting thing for me
is the opportunity to always learn more
[SPEAKER_06]: with a new crop, which is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the idea that we might be able to
bridge the gap between the research that's
[SPEAKER_06]: happening right now in academia and what's
going on in the field in cultivation with
[SPEAKER_06]: growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's the biggest challenge
and also the most exciting thing is like
[SPEAKER_06]: we can actually participate in actively
learning more about this crop and there's
[SPEAKER_06]: very few crops left that we can say that
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who'd like to go next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Brandon Hudson.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work for KISS Organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do the bulk of the soil analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been around this plant my whole life.
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents grew weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a teepee when I was four made out of
stocks from a harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been around it my whole life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking to Tad's dad yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just never had any kind of
uncomfortability about it or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just something that was like salt
and pepper in my environment growing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, it was always the
constant reminders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I've been growing as an adult on my
own for 39 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is my 39th year and I've done
deep water culture, rockwool slabs,
[SPEAKER_04]: cocoa, all the salt stuff and,
you know, coliseums, all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done large scale facilities in South
Carolina with hemp, both indoor and
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say the biggest challenge for
organics would be heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when we look at numbers that
small, parts per billion, we look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: almost infinite number of opportunities
for some sort of contamination along the
[SPEAKER_04]: way in the testing, even after the sample
has been looked at.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like getting some real national
guidelines for how that should be done
[SPEAKER_04]: properly, how the testing should be done
properly, the water, all that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that's the biggest challenge
for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that hat, Brandon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to represent, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to cover up the six heads so I
don't blind anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started growing maybe 14 years ago in
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved to Alaska and I had just been
getting really good blue dream from Cali
[SPEAKER_03]: medical scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I went to Alaska,
not as much imports up there and the
[SPEAKER_03]: people that I knew did not know how to
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very quickly we realized, if we were
gonna get good stuff, we were gonna have
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: First apartment, someone just brought over
a bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I threw a light into a closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing peat moss and compost teas and
some back guano teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we got evicted from that
apartment for growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I ended up realizing I had to rent
a house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got into a house and started
getting some cool genetics over from
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the stuff in the overseas,
like Attitude Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started to realize how
important genetics were because the first
[SPEAKER_03]: time I ever grew, I think it was chocolate
cross with kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a part of anything I'd ever
smoked before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I knew I wasn't that good at growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it had to be something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then slowly but surely just kind of
swung and switched craft and went more and
[SPEAKER_03]: more organic, less bottle trance until I
actually learned how to grow in living
[SPEAKER_03]: soil through Tad's podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then ended up meeting Tad and coming
to work for the business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been a great ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think my biggest struggles over the
years was learning how to water in living
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so different when you switch from a
sterile media I had always had great
[SPEAKER_03]: success with the bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my first grow, I overwatered
pretty bad in living organics and the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants just looked horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen them lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't look horrible anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my name is Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent a lot of time learning about
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't actually grown too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't even jump into this
industry until about 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before that time, I was legitimately
underwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was scuba diving and hanging out with
Maury Eales and doing my research on
[SPEAKER_02]: marine ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So long story short, we moved up into the
Olympia area.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother-in-law at the time still does,
but it expanded owns a tier two
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I called him up and I said,
Hey, I'm looking for a gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, would you like a
scientific eye on any of this stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, well, that doesn't exist
currently in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I took a year essentially of just
keeping my mouth shut, acting like a
[SPEAKER_02]: gardener, learning the plant, learning the
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a bit lucky with the fact that they
do grow in living soil, organic,
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainable kind of approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that soil was KISS organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I kind of met Tad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was actually pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when Nate and I were talking to
the owner of Goldleaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, yeah, I'd love to have you up
here, but you know, you gotta kind of have
[SPEAKER_02]: an idea of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could, this is while I was still
living and working in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, uh, yeah, take a listen to this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's by a friend of mine named,
uh, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, at that time I was still in
academia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a whole booklet of just all the
notes from all those first I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30, 40, 50 episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just trying to study and learn
like I knew how.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I started really kind of getting into
the growing in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my kind of soap box flash feeling
about cannabis is, uh, funny enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be one of the main
crops that saves agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds kind of hyperbolic,
but, um, we're lucky enough to have a crop
[SPEAKER_02]: that's got so much margin that we can
really play with stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, whether that's irrigation,
lighting, you know, all these other
[SPEAKER_02]: things, a lot of other industries don't
have that kind of margin to really push
[SPEAKER_02]: and test the limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I think when things start getting
more complicated, as far as growing kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of crops outdoors that we've normally
done, um, I think people are going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: to look at how to do things indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those who want to do things
sustainably and organically will have a
[SPEAKER_02]: very logical place to look.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's folks like us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the hardest thing about growing
cannabis, this was something that I
[SPEAKER_02]: wrestled with doing during my learning,
my heavy learning phase, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, especially coming out of a place that
was always looking for primary literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, trying to find empirical data and
research about cultivation practices is it
[SPEAKER_02]: just doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sure, like medicinal and, you know,
psycho effects, like there's plenty of
[SPEAKER_02]: research on that, but actually how to
benefit the plant more and get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, more holistic properties out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's very little on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was frustrating, but it was also
very exciting where we kind of get to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, forge that road, um,
and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very rarely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel very lucky to have landed in an
industry that you know, doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole lot of previous work on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super exciting and I feel really
lucky to have landed where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we have another question from
Margaret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, she asks what cultivars do you prefer
to grow and why, and how do you find,
[SPEAKER_00]: determine and test out cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's probably a good one for Andrew
and Brandon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, Andrew, would you like to start?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, or Brandon can go.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, my answer might get pretty long here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of like my, uh, my jam to my
peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can, I can give my short answer
and then Andrew can elucidate on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm primarily growing indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is a huge factor just immediately
right out the gate for what cultivars I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: going to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you, you have to look for
something that is a manageable structure,
[SPEAKER_04]: structure and time length based on your
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you, you always want to
match the hatch and if you're going to,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're in Southern California and you
want to grow some haze plants outside,
[SPEAKER_04]: that makes perfect sense to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have a long enough season.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have the right weather,
probably kind of what Ben was alluding to
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we're going to be indoor for growing
eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weather's getting just too
unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but so with me, you know, I,
I'm trying to be able to provide
[SPEAKER_04]: information and support for facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of those facilities need an eight or
a nine week production plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of my decisions are, are made so
that I can support the growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I stick to, you know, those eight,
nine week plants for the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's, there's some stuff like GMO,
there's some hazes that, um, I love.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just take too long.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is a situation where it might be
worth it for me to grow one plant outdoor,
[SPEAKER_04]: pull tarps on it, something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the most part, I'm looking for
something that will finish on time and
[SPEAKER_04]: something that has a short structure,
but gives me the yields that I'm looking
[SPEAKER_04]: for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then beyond that, it's just a matter
of personal taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, some people like the, you know,
the real sedative couch lock stuff that I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, I don't, I'm already hungry and
tired.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need more of that in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I, I like energetic, laughy,
uh, communicative strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like strains that, um, I can do math on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like strains that, um, I hate to say it,
but it's really hard to get high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, you know, I, I smoke too much and
so I've got a really high tolerance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm really looking for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I just, it's a piece of candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, it's candy throughout the
day that I just love the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I feel like I can smell good cannabis
and it just changes my mood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, just that, just being in a room with a
bunch of good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at a harvest yesterday, tangy turps
for days, you know, as far as,
[SPEAKER_04]: as far as you could smell, it was just
tangy turps and it was great, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I did, you know, I didn't even feel
like smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just in a great mood.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, so yeah, so for me, I'm trying to
basically, I'm, I'm trying to match my
[SPEAKER_04]: environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to find something that fits the
space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get an adequate yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and we're always looking for,
I love Justin McGill's dad's like three
[SPEAKER_04]: step joint process of like, he likes to
take a dry toke and get that just that
[SPEAKER_04]: pure terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then he said he likes to light it,
but he'll just light it like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: He won't draw through it because he says
he likes to do the wave test like as
[SPEAKER_04]: though he's at a concert.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I want, I want to have that
best smelling weed in the concert.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, so I, I, you know, uh,
I don't tend personally to pick for
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal value, although I do use
cannabis for, for pain management,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've broken most of the bones in my body
and, um, it helps with migraines.
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps with all that stuff for me,
but I'm not specifically chasing any one
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal cannabinoid profile or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just add something really small to
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, one, one other consideration to think
about is we know that there are certain
[SPEAKER_06]: plants that now have genes that will make
them more resistant to powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_06]: for example, or when you go into a
commercial room, you'll see some plants
[SPEAKER_06]: that won't express hoplite and viroid,
but others will.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so because of the genetic variability
in cannabis, um, selecting plants that are
[SPEAKER_06]: better for your environment, like brandy,
the lunatic can, can go a long ways
[SPEAKER_06]: towards finishing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, here in Washington, with all the
rains we get outdoors is really
[SPEAKER_06]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, that's just something that I want
to always keep in the back of my mind when
[SPEAKER_06]: I 'm picking what genetics I'm going to
run.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to dovetail back into what Tad
just said, if I go into a room and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's, you know, like I was in a room
yesterday with probably 12 different
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivars, big, big room, and let's say 11
of them are, are doing great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them's for whatever reason
you're seeing a trace element issue,
[SPEAKER_04]: or I think it's the white star dog over at
Mako that always finishes with a
[SPEAKER_04]: manganese, very visible manganese issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, if I've got a plant that's,
I mean, it would have to be real roadkill
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it would have to be like one of
the Holy grail cultivars that's gone now
[SPEAKER_04]: for me to be willing to deal with or baby
a cultivar that was, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: not responding well within the average
targets that we, that we work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's another consideration.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I have outliers that just don't perform
well in my environment, my MPK,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever, I'll get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew, do you want to jump in?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a little bit unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people with my kind of disposition
towards cannabis don't enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm very, very sensitive to sedative
effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like what Brandon was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wake up tired and hungry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need any help in that,
in that department.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, I'm looking for things that
really invigorate and seeming to help with
[SPEAKER_03]: creativity, inspirational, motivational
things, things of that sort.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then along with some kind of overall
feeling of wellness, or like he said,
[SPEAKER_03]: like giggles, or, you know, if I can
determine that, then that's usually what
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I've found is I, the modern day
genetics don't usually offer that for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If something is going to flower in eight
to nine weeks, it almost always leaves me
[SPEAKER_03]: dragging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I personally prefer combinations of
land race and what I would call legendary
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties, varieties that just have
outstanding flavor, resin production,
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties that have stayed and stuck
around through all the different hype kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of cycles that cannabis goes through.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Chem 91 and Congo lease,
or the, any African, really, I love the
[SPEAKER_03]: different African varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Chem 91 crossed with Congo,
they just go very well together.
[SPEAKER_03]: The African land race provides a unique,
energetic, almost heart racing sensation.
[SPEAKER_03]: While the Chem adds a certain potency and
flavor, just mix really well together and
[SPEAKER_03]: it levels out the chem so the chem doesn't
take you under if you smoke too often.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, the African can be
too intense for some people and they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to feel that like hot heart racing
sensation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to admit, I like the speedy
paranoid side of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to tell on myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like if, if, if I smoke,
I want to like go for a walk or like,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I said, go do some math or like maybe
even think about the next cross I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: make or what genetics I think are going to
go good together.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if my mind is hindered or I just feel
overall lethargic, it's not fun for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so another thing I love are hazes for
that very reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: A haze is one of the very few cultivars
that already has potency and almost a
[SPEAKER_03]: spiritual effect mixed with some kind of
psychedelic high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hazes are very different from anything
I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then me and Brandon have also found
that when sour diesel is mixed in with the
[SPEAKER_03]: true haze genetic, just the flower
structure increases.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smells are way better.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flavor is off the charts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to come up with something
that does better than a sour diesel haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are things like I would keep in
my garden forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I like to experiment with other
land race varieties just to see what it
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like personally, I've found Pakistani
crossed with Honduras crossed with Congo
[SPEAKER_03]: will give you almost a psychedelic haze
effect, but it's much more like a soft
[SPEAKER_03]: daydream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it can just totally blot out
hours from your day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really unique experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't get heavy, but I don't always
grow that because I don't want to lose
[SPEAKER_03]: hours of my day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good one for like a Sunday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amnesia haze will do that to you like six
hours later.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I did something, but I don't know
what or with who.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to find the balance between
something like amnesia haze where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like your whole day is gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then something like Honduras where
it's like two hours are gone and it can be
[SPEAKER_03]: good and functional for a Sunday when you
don't have to get anything done.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not going to grow it time and time
again because it doesn't have the same
[SPEAKER_03]: energetic productivity like an African
mixed with a haze would.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I'm hunting seeds,
like how do I find, determine,
[SPEAKER_03]: test out a cultivar?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge fan of microbreeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always run tiny pots first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're looking to really stress out
a population, microbreeding is very
[SPEAKER_03]: useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you're looking to, let's say hunt 12
different cultivars and you have 12 seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: of each, you can do all that at one time
in a four by four tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can look at these different
variations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you put them against the whole
population, a lot easier to see a
[SPEAKER_03]: standout.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas if you're only growing four plants
in a bed and you have 80, 100,000 seeds to
[SPEAKER_03]: work through, it's going to take the rest
of your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each seed is like a lottery ticket.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might not find anything worthwhile
and you might think you found something
[SPEAKER_03]: cool when really that's not even what that
line has to offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just had a really good grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course a plant is going to look
great and smell great if your grow is on
[SPEAKER_03]: point, which is why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you flowering all those out like
immediately and then re-vegging them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you like growing them enough to clone
them then?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, cause like if you just flower it
out, don't leave anything to re-veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to lose them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ideally, you would clone before flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're low on space and all you
have to work with is a four by four tent,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can re-veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to do what I call a quick
flip.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you take them more than two or three
weeks in, depending on the variety,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to be very hard to bring them
back out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have an eye for it and you can
determine a few characteristics that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're looking for, you can call out.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the population in that first two
weeks, just based on your runts,
[SPEAKER_03]: things that are like Brandon said,
showing a random deficiency, things that
[SPEAKER_03]: just don't want to get going, things that
don't stretch at all, or things that too
[SPEAKER_03]: much.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can really see a lot in the first two
weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you bring them back,
you can up pot, let's say you go from 200
[SPEAKER_03]: down to 20 after those first two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot more manageable to clone the
resulting 20 plants and then continue
[SPEAKER_03]: testing further on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can at least pick out your girls
and the type of structure that you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can dig back in and really
look for that standout among those 20,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe let's say one gallon pots or a bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw something really interesting
yesterday just on the re-veg topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Justin's been running this grapefruit
strain for over a decade and they used to
[SPEAKER_04]: re-veg it, re-veg it, re-veg it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's at a point now where it will only
throw on three leaves, no matter how
[SPEAKER_04]: mature the plant gets, no matter how big
the mom gets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're actually going back through
tissue culture to, I guess, reverse that
[SPEAKER_04]: so that the plant will grow properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how they're going to get around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just thought that was really
interesting because I've always had pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: good results luck with re-vegging plants,
but in a perfect world, I prefer to label
[SPEAKER_04]: all the moms, take cuts off of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got my cuts, flower the moms out,
then decide who I want to keep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've kind of fallen in love with this
super silver hay, sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I try not to fall in love with any one
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just threw that whole pillowcase full of
seeds out there just to show I've got a
lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of genetics, like I've got millions
of bees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm always popping something new,
always.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Brandon, can I ask a question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, why would you, okay, so if you're,
you're, you're popping your seeds and
[SPEAKER_05]: you've got your moms, why would you flower
out the mom and keep a pet?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why wouldn't you keep the mom and flower
out a pet?
[SPEAKER_04]: You could do either way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could do either way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, like in my, in my facility,
I had a 3000 square foot head house that
[SPEAKER_04]: was always super short for space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a 60 by 120 greenhouse that
there was always, you know, I had,
[SPEAKER_04]: so I had most, you know, I had like,
it was like 88%, 92% of the floor was
[SPEAKER_04]: accounted for, but I still had big areas
on either end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would just drag a mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over and flower her out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way I'd get a big yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's a nice, big, healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to worry about it since it's
not sitting in the best environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you don't want to stack a bunch of
young sensitive plants in front of the wet
[SPEAKER_04]: wall in South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just heard some people say,
you know, some conflicting things about,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you should, you should,
you should always flower out the mom and
[SPEAKER_05]: keep a cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've always been accustomed to keeping
the mom, the actual, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the seed stock, the mom and flowering cuts
off of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mom is seed stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to have the F1 vigor,
which typically means she's, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: going to stick around, but I don't keep my
mom's for probably three months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six months is the max, but I think three
months is probably better just to keep
[SPEAKER_04]: propagation numbers up and that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not kicking the load or something
along with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just think that, that, that works a
little bit better for me, but you could do
[SPEAKER_04]: either.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like, I don't know if the,
uh, this was months ago, but I had a thing
[SPEAKER_04]: on Instagram and I don't know if we did it
on here or not, but I was showing where I
[SPEAKER_04]: took a bunch of cuts and immediately threw
them into 1212.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was rooting under 1212, but I also
got to see, you know, I sexed all my,
[SPEAKER_04]: my green mouth run that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's just, there's, you know,
there's so many ways to get there with
[SPEAKER_04]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause the mom is first generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the first cut that comes off the
second generation.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it depends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people, you know, I got a buddy in
Detroit who at this point has had this
[SPEAKER_04]: lights plant for like 37 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's had the same mom with horrible idea
to veg a plant for 37 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, on him, like, that's
incredible that he's been able to keep
[SPEAKER_04]: that alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just, I don't think that's smart,
but he must be romantically in love with
[SPEAKER_04]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this big around.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably, you probably couldn't
drive a nail through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the number of times he's had to
chop it off, it's like eight feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it just, it was like,
it's like a, it's like a stump and then
[SPEAKER_04]: like a porcupine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like a urban mix, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like one of those stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I, no, I'll, I'll have to,
I'll reach out to him and get some
[SPEAKER_04]: pictures because that'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy, he, uh, I met him at a,
uh, Bob Weir show in Detroit in like 90,
[SPEAKER_04]: 95 and, um, right after I had been
attacked by a giant pink dragon that came
[SPEAKER_04]: out of the sunset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he, he, uh, he saved me that night.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a really crazy story.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I should record,
but I'll bring it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hangout story.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I want to add something, but go
ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to throw in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, again, like, I don't know if,
um, if there's too much interest in like
[SPEAKER_02]: the facility side of things, as opposed to
just like your own personal, like grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: exploration, but, uh, a little context
from the facility side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I guess the commercial is we're always
seed testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always, you know, hunting because if
you stop moving in this industry or you're
[SPEAKER_02]: behind yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, if you do have some space,
it's really fun to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, obviously as long as you're not going
to be putting any stress or strain or
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen on the stuff you don't want it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, as far as like figuring out,
like, you know, for us too, then from a
[SPEAKER_02]: facility standpoint, like we need to try
to do this as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and just getting to that flowering
stage to figure out if it's a male or
[SPEAKER_02]: female can take a long time and use up a
bunch of resources that theoretically 50%
[SPEAKER_02]: of those plants will end up dying anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do sell these leaf works kits,
these gender kits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in fact, I'll throw them into the chat
right now, link to the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're curious, um, so that way you
basically just take a little leaf,
[SPEAKER_02]: smush a leaf in there and then send it and
mail it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, they'll get back to you and went
and let you know, if you got a male or
[SPEAKER_02]: female well before you need to take that
thing all the way to flower to figure it
[SPEAKER_02]: out on your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it helps that process a lot faster
early on and that way you don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: have as much space in your veg or your
phenol hunts space, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can weed those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no pun intended.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had a hundred percent with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I've ever had happen is I
did have one plant herm that I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that's not the test fault,
but the test read correctly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, since we're talking about moms,
I know there was another question about
[SPEAKER_06]: moms.
[SPEAKER_06]: In general, in terms of how to best keep
them and what size container and some of
[SPEAKER_06]: that, I thought that might be a good
transition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, and like you guys touched on the
woody stems is a big thing over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: These plants, every time you take a cut,
you know, you're going to end up with
[SPEAKER_06]: more, uh, offshoots and it just becomes a
nightmare over time of a, of a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, plus I think the, the health of the
plant and the viability of the plant and
[SPEAKER_06]: goes down, uh, over time would just
continue all wounding and pruning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, when we talk about a long time,
but, uh, in terms of how people are
[SPEAKER_06]: storing these plants, most of the
facilities we work with are organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, most of them are in a range of
containers ranging from, I've seen them as
[SPEAKER_06]: small as seven gallon, typically 20 or 30
gallon pots, uh, collective elevation.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go check out that tour on YouTube,
they did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do two plants in a four by eight bed
with a trellis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know if the workflow on that
is better, but I have to say it's one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the coolest looking arm rooms I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so you should definitely check that
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the, the challenge on the fertility
side of moms is what I wanted to touch on
[SPEAKER_06]: before you guys jump in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, that's really interesting
because, you know, a lot of us,
[SPEAKER_06]: the, with the soil beds, you know,
the way that we like to grow and kiss with
[SPEAKER_06]: beds and reinventing the soil with soil
testing every cycle, that's really
[SPEAKER_06]: challenging with moms, especially if you
keep moms for more than a cycle or two,
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's, uh, one, there's not going
to be a lot of soil left in that pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be mostly root mass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And two, managing the fertility in that
pot with top dressing is really
[SPEAKER_06]: challenging, um, in terms of keeping that
mom healthy and healthy moms is the most
[SPEAKER_06]: important thing for your facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, having success and even for home
growers and having success through flower,
[SPEAKER_06]: starting with like a really healthy clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I don't have a healthy mom,
I'm not going to start my next cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it's that important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that's where little things like,
uh, fish hydrolysis, um, a bottle of
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrient program with light doses coming
really handy, or, um, even something like
[SPEAKER_06]: Jax, like a conventional salt based
fertilizer in small doses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, those things are all just really
effective ways to keep your moms healthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I would much rather, you know,
for example, run Jax or use a bottle of
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrient line to make sure I'm keeping my
fertility up in that 30 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: My mom looks healthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then Natalie trying to top dress as I see
deficiencies, knowing that they're not
[SPEAKER_06]: going to get into the plant for another
seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now my plant stress and I'm going to
have to take cuttings off of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it becomes a real hassle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it, to me, it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so unless because every genetics are
going to, they're all going to be a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit different.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't just say that here's a top
dress kiss.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit for your moms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and it's going to work for all your
moms because of the wide variety of
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics that we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, that's a, it's, that's,
that was a good question that was asked in
[SPEAKER_06]: our, in our Q and a list.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's sort of how I would address it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if someone else want to add anything
or can I add something?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys should check out a grassroots
super food bed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's fish hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fish hydrolysis base.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got Kalamag bunch of other nutrients
in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is exactly what I use to feed my
moms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got them in, um, 15 gallon,
uh, fabric, um, grassroots spots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, they're probably, uh,
they gotta be about three foot by three
[SPEAKER_05]: foot by four foot tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I have zero issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feed them once a week, um, with their,
uh, with their super food.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I hit them once, uh, once a week
with, um, what is it Pacific, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: Grove fish hydrolysis and, uh,
zero nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, uh, I mean faster growth than
I've seen in, um, and faster growth than
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen in a soil situation with,
um, bottle nutrients, just my input.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long are you running?
[SPEAKER_04]: How long are you keeping those moms alive?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and I kind of want to try him in a
couple of minutes ago too, because
[SPEAKER_05]: generally what I do is.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I find a phenol that I like,
um, it is my, my, my F1, my first
[SPEAKER_05]: generation mom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably keep it around for like six or
seven months.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I take the cutting off of it and
I marked the tag second generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm able to keep that around for
like some of them upwards of a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I kind of see around like eight,
nine, 11, 12 months, they kind of start to
[SPEAKER_05]: get finicky.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's that whole fertility
thing, um, that you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_05]: not to mention trying to up, up part from
a 15 or 20 gallon pot to like a 30 or 40.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's not feasible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, when I, when Dwayne put the
question forward, because I work at kiss
[SPEAKER_04]: and because I use kiss soil, I know,
and because I regularly rotate my mom,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least every three months, I know that I
can keep a nice, vigorous, healthy plant
[SPEAKER_04]: that was bedged in a one gallon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can throw that into a 10, or a 12 gallon
smart pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can run that and kiss biochar water
only CGM for three months.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not going to see any deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_04]: That plan will be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, as far as the nutrient side of things,
calcium and phosphorus are the two that I
[SPEAKER_04]: try to make sure on point for my mom's
just as far as having the best propagation
[SPEAKER_04]: results.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so those, those are the two
elements that show up as being an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody is just caught, you know,
if you're, if you're not, if your clones
[SPEAKER_04]: are not rooting, first thing you want to
do is get a scope out and look at your
[SPEAKER_04]: moms and make sure you don't have russets
or something horrible like that going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that that's definitely, you know,
something that can happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see propagation numbers drop off
with russets, but you'll also see it drop
[SPEAKER_04]: off with calcium.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see it drop off with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then when the, the environment of
the, of the propagation is not ideal,
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got super low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, relative humidity or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, because I'm doing regularly
rotating my mom's, I like a 10 or 12
[SPEAKER_04]: gallon smart pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like, like, at least 450 for my PPFD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go as high as 600, um, for my mom's.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that's, that's adequate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, it just, I just try to
make sure I have enough to, cover my
[SPEAKER_04]: needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to make sure I've got cuts that I
don't need sitting around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I try to make sure I've got cuts
before I need them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would always rather have a plant that's
a little bit bigger that I can trim back.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that nice big root mass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause when you've got a small shoots and a
giant root mass and you throw it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: bed, it goes crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I just did the opposite big shoots,
almost no roots and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: lost power for two days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it got cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so everything is just moving a little
slowly this time, but as far as,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, metrics, that's, that's,
you know, what I'm shooting for,
[SPEAKER_04]: for a mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For us, for us at the facility,
it's, um, we really don't like to let them
[SPEAKER_02]: go more than really three months,
maybe four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the big reason for that is,
um, obviously we've got a whole area ready
[SPEAKER_02]: to go for clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not use it for just mom's?
[SPEAKER_02]: As well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the thing to think about two guys
is plants are a lot like us in some
[SPEAKER_02]: respects, like the hormones change over
the years, guys, it sucks, but it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when they're young and ready to grow,
they're going to be moving stuff all over
[SPEAKER_02]: their body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking cuttings from anywhere is going
to give you a really good shot at getting
[SPEAKER_02]: some really vigorously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready to go babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, once those moms get woody and older,
it takes, it's a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fighting gravity more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, those things get woodier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard, those, and just the hormones
change, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant changes, all that stuff changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lot harder to clone off of an
older plant, even if it's the healthiest,
[SPEAKER_02]: prettiest, happiest looking thing in the
world, just because the starting materials
[SPEAKER_02]: that you want in a clone, aren't going to
be there in abundance as you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: using from a younger mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it, it helps to keep them young
for sure, as far as.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your success rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's, it's also good to,
um, take into consideration that we,
[SPEAKER_03]: we are growing an annual.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even in the best of conditions,
let's say Southern California,
[SPEAKER_03]: you start your season February,
they're flowering in August.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even by then, I think that's a bit of
a long, you know, most people are looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at May to August, which is three months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that plant's just ready to flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it doesn't want to keep growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wants to flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I've found that I take biochar soil
and I'll either add a couple cups of bloom
[SPEAKER_03]: booster, or I'll just specifically add
fish bone and gypsum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, I keep my mom's in one
gallons.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely the bigger the pot,
the longer you can keep it happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in one gallons every two months,
um, I take the most atypical branch and I
[SPEAKER_03]: take it down about eight inches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I use that to reset.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've found that they don't skip a beat
as long as you use enough plant material
[SPEAKER_03]: and it has dominance because there's going
to be a higher concentration of oxen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're kind of taking this,
the brain center of the plant at that
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then when that goes into the soil
and that roots, the amount of growth
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to see come off of that clone
after it's rooted is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way more growth than you would see from
trying to keep a mom for six, seven
[SPEAKER_03]: months, but it is more work to continually
reset.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're watering, not on point,
those one gallon pots can, can really kill
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say beds are the best,
but who's got beds available for each mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: You made me feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in like two gallon pots reset and like
every two to three months, basically just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get two runs out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad I'm not the only one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've, I've, I've done it with jacks and
solo cups, you know, like I was just doing
[SPEAKER_04]: hydroponically, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, you don't know how you feed
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's really no limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we had a question on IG, um,
from eco-thrift, um, saying I'm noticing a
[SPEAKER_00]: churned away from the standard 18 inch
grassroots make, uh, towards shallow 12
[SPEAKER_00]: inch and 10 inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also seen a few facilities use
taller 24 inch beds, which seems
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question he's asking is,
um, when planning to use beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: what considerations should be taken into
account for the bed depth?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is 10 to 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just for me, the analogy I always use
is if you've got a tall beer glass and
[SPEAKER_04]: then a short wide scotch glass and you
have them full of sand and you pour water
[SPEAKER_04]: into them and come back in a half an hour,
that tall beer Stein's going to be pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: wet at the bottom and pretty dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other two thirds that scotch glass,
because it's short and wide is going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: much more uniform in the moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it just makes your moisture
management that much easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also dealing with really rich
organic soil, which holds a lot of water
[SPEAKER_04]: and has a lot of weight to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, add in another 12 inches, another six
inches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adds, you know, a lot of weight and a lot
of water weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, yeah, for me, I like a
shallower bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to chime in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't, uh, we haven't determined what
the minimum depth is for growing in beds
[SPEAKER_06]: and constantly testing and recycling the
soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but what we have found is facilities
like gold leaf, where Ben works as well as
[SPEAKER_06]: the research scientists, um, and inches
has been sufficient.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we, there's multiple places like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We work with that have gone with 10
inches.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just a nice one, because if you
have a 12 inch bed, you have a nice little
[SPEAKER_06]: two inch lip, um, to keep things from
spilling out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I don't see any advantage really
to going a lot deeper than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we, we haven't done a side by
side, uh, here, here in my place,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little bit deeper than that,
but only because I had an excessive amount
[SPEAKER_06]: of soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to fill the bed up more
because the beds were so deep from
[SPEAKER_06]: grassroots, but I don't think I needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That much soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone want to add anything to that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just say, if you want to buy more soil
from kiss, we're happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ended up talking to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, okay, well, I've got 18 or
24 inches.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we ended up talking to them out of
buying a bunch of soil, just because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to make their life a lot easier as
the grower, you know, also I'll mention
[SPEAKER_06]: the math works out really well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a four by four works out perfectly for
a half a yard of soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, like Brandon said, we've had
people call up and say, I need a hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: yards of soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we redo the math and we're like,
you only need 60, you know, and that's
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands of dollars in savings and trade
and, and, and cost on soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, on that note, that's also why I
personally prefer the shorter blue mat
[SPEAKER_06]: carrots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I know that was a question someone
was asking about too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the really deep carrots
because I want to know my soil moisture,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, closer to the surface for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, unless I have a really, really deep
bed, but even then I haven't seen any data
[SPEAKER_06]: to support needing a deeper carrot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I almost exclusively use the short
carrots with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're talking about like a fruit tree
or something, then that's a different
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation, but we're going to dry out
from the top first.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to keep that point moist though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that's sort of where I want to be
sensing soil tension.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Ben, do you want to touch on that at
all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the thing too, to think about again,
from a facility and production standpoint
[SPEAKER_02]: is depending on the size of bed you're
growing in, you're going to likely be
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing in six to nine, maybe 12 gallons
of soil every transplant round,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're going to be adding those
one gallons if that's what you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do start your beds with less
than the lip, then you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually get quite a few rounds before you
have to deal with taking soil out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: bed because you've, you know, continually
added more, um, as you go through the
[SPEAKER_02]: rounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing for soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you guys can think of water as kind of
like a pyramid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it drops onto the surface,
it kind of does this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, at some point, if you have too
much, you know, volume in your beds
[SPEAKER_02]: because of how, you know, the,
the cycle of the plants and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 70 some odd days, um, you're just not
going to be accessing that bottom horizon
[SPEAKER_02]: of your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to sit there, maybe go
anaerobic if you're not careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it, it, you know, you're, you're
basically making things easier on
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself, um, for a few different reasons
by not just going like, yeah, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have an 18 inch, 16 inch bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we at Gold Leaf, the, the max we'll do
is 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's after probably the half a
dozen, maybe eight or so rounds of just
[SPEAKER_02]: adding nine gallons every transplant to
each bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually we'll take it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do with that, we'll actually let
it rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put it back in a tote and take it
outside and let it sit for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, we'll actually reuse
it and turn that back into, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, veg mix that we'll reuse to
shuffle in with some new stuff and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, just kind of keep it sustainable as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you doing the bottom with plots or
planting directly in your beds?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tad and I just talked about this a couple
hours ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just go straight into beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's a trial that we're going to try
to get going on here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know that, uh, Green Life
Productions does great with that,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, methodology of just plopping those
things right on the bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my questions that we want to
investigate are one, like how much,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, height do you lose if any,
you know, you're sitting on top of a bed
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and secondly, I really want to get at,
and I haven't figured out how we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to do this yet, but I would really love to
figure out the lag time between,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when you put that pot on top of
your soil surface versus getting that
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere already down into a network of
roots and mycorrhizae and all sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that were there from the previous
round.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how fast can those handshakes happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: And does that show up in your results?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, whether that's yield or quality,
you know, cannabinoid, all that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's my kind of, that's my thinking
as far as the reason why I'm not out here
[SPEAKER_02]: just, you know, slinging them because I
really don't know yet if you're the time
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes for those roots to be like,
oh yeah, this looks cool and get down into
[SPEAKER_02]: there versus just them already showing up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anecdotally, I would say from my
experience is there's a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference, but also I kind of liked the
idea of removing the root mass every time
[SPEAKER_01]: too, cause I'm scared of HLVD and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do that when we go straight into
the story, we'll pull the main root ball
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll shake off most of that dirt though,
cause that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that, you know, handshake between
mycorrhizal and all those inoculants that
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to try to keep in there and then
recharge them with some amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And plants are in the next day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin has large beds, Mako farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: He does not, so he always, he ends up with
an excess amount of soil as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's probably at this point got 20 or
30 yards of soil that he's moved out of
[SPEAKER_06]: the facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's, he's afraid of bringing that
back in because if he did have,
[SPEAKER_06]: like, let's say you had some root aphids
or something like that, you're potentially
[SPEAKER_06]: bringing it back into your bedroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one risk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if, you know, it's going outside and
you could be bringing in rips or,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, other exterior pests,
potentially back into your room.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he made a decision to always use fresh
soil to start his veg.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you know, your veg has to be your
mother's and then your veg has to be the
[SPEAKER_06]: cleanest place in your facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gold leaf, less stressed about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They move it out for a year, towed it up
and stays in the back end.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is something to consider in your
decision making on using soil once it's,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, once your bed gets too full.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to touch on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Louisa.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a potato farm next door and
potatoes, root aphid.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go hand in hand like peanut butter
and jelly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so after getting bit by root aphids in
the previous grows, he's decided not to
[SPEAKER_04]: risk it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could finish up about watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of questions about blue mats,
a lot of which you've already answered,
[SPEAKER_00]: but do you have a question from Nathaniel?
[SPEAKER_00]: His question is about watering after
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asks about how to water before and when
to do water after.
[SPEAKER_00]: He feels his plants often stall at
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also he asked when to add blue mats,
re-transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should you wait for roots to get to the
bottom or should you add blue mats right
[SPEAKER_00]: away and always keep soil saturated?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can start with that if you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: All very, very good questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be maybe a little bit of
a frustrating answer because so much of it
[SPEAKER_02]: depends on your environment and your grow
room, whatever you're doing it in,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it really is a matter of how much
those plants are transpiring and how fast
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going through whatever water
you're giving them.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the facility, our flower rooms will get
hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The previous day, they will get hit with
almost a good flush, not a crazy flush,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we will try to move some of those
sodium that built up sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: For what it's worth again, that gold leaf,
I think we're coming up, jeez,
[SPEAKER_02]: Tad, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think nine years of reusing the same
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sodium can show up every now and then
because we've been using the same medium
[SPEAKER_02]: over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will do a flush in which case those
beds are ultra wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really have that impact too much
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll still go in the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get hit with a compost tee right
after transplant regardless.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those beds are very, very wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on our environmental,
the size of the rooms, airflow,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that stuff, it's actually not until 10
more days until that soil is back within
[SPEAKER_02]: range to where we want to put those blue
mats back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's been all figured out just by
trial and error of using the moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: meters and testing a bunch of beds and
figuring out the sweet spot of that 80 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 100, maybe 140 M bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when that kind of levels out
and then the blue mats go in.
[SPEAKER_02]: When to put blue mats in, again,
that's going to depend heavily on how much
[SPEAKER_02]: water you're adding pre, during,
post transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're really just going to want
to keep an eye on the moisture levels
[SPEAKER_02]: whether you want to spot check randomly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go to a container or a bed and just
say, literally throw a dart and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know what it is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I want to know what it is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another really valuable method to
keeping an eye on moisture level is get a
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic chopstick and put a little piece
of flagging tape on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just stick it in the bed or in a
container somewhere at the exact same
[SPEAKER_02]: spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's your sensing spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time you want to take a soil
moisture reading, if you've got a meter,
[SPEAKER_02]: you go right chopstick, put it in the
exact same spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way you have a consistent spot to
get a sense of how fast water might be
[SPEAKER_02]: moving through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's pros and cons to both of those
different methods as far as figuring out
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly what your soil moisture is and
when to install blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that process, you're going to learn
a lot about your room just by
[SPEAKER_02]: experimenting and figuring out when do I
put, that one question you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: like, holy smokes, like I watered these
beds to 20 M bar, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm on day seven and we're at 50,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really is the kind of like,
holy smokes, this, they don't need that
[SPEAKER_02]: much water or, oh my God, you know,
my room's super hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on day four and I'm at 160,
like, whoops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that kind of experimentation
that, you know, just the question of when
[SPEAKER_02]: do I put blue mats in and really be a very
powerful learning experience for how your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants interact with their environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did just want to add real,
sometimes people miss a step on
[SPEAKER_03]: transplanting because their plants are
slightly overwatered or very saturated
[SPEAKER_03]: before they go into the beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always let my veg plants dry down
before transplanting into the bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way they're like hungry for the water
and any soil without root mass is probably
[SPEAKER_03]: going to hold or retain extra water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having those plants be really hungry
for water drives the roots down further
[SPEAKER_03]: into the bed faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to have a lot less likely
time of overwatering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Ben said, even if it's really wet
bed, the plants will have a time to bounce
[SPEAKER_03]: back as long as you don't continue
watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're watering every day and the soil
is wet, those plants could have serious
[SPEAKER_03]: side effects if not slow down growth
altogether.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's a good point, Andrew.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'll go real fast, Brandon.
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically I just want to say some best
practices with transplanting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure to transplant the optimal time
for that plant, which means the roots are
[SPEAKER_06]: just reaching the edge of the pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not starting to wrap around or
girdle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see photos all the time on social media
of people like, look at my healthy roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really just root girdling because
the roots have already started circling
[SPEAKER_06]: around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that is the case, because it
happens, you need to really be aggressive
[SPEAKER_06]: and actually cut and break up those roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise the plant will continue to
struggle because where growth happens or
[SPEAKER_06]: where nutrient exchange happens is at the
root tip.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that root tip is circling back into
the plant, it's not able to access all the
[SPEAKER_06]: soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And coming from a nursery background,
when you buy a nursery plant, a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: them are already girdled.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you just take that plant,
it's called a rose or an arborvitae or
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever, and just plant it right in the
ground like that, you can come back six
[SPEAKER_06]: months later and that root ball will look
exactly the same because the roots aren't
[SPEAKER_06]: able to work out into the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have that same issue in cannabis
indoors because we're using all the same
[SPEAKER_06]: media.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you do plant outdoors, same sort of
thing, make sure to mix in some of your
[SPEAKER_06]: native soil with maybe some 50-50 with
compost and create a transition into your
[SPEAKER_06]: native soil if that's what you're going
into rather than into your beds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, like Andrew mentioned, the other
thing that's really important is making
[SPEAKER_06]: sure that your plant is not too wet going
in because you want to water a transplant.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means your plants have to be ready
to accept the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they don't need to be super dry,
but they should be ready for a watering
[SPEAKER_06]: event at the time of transplant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So plan that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then after you water them in
thoroughly, you are waiting longer because
[SPEAKER_06]: just right after transplant, it's going to
take a while for those roots to really
[SPEAKER_06]: start growing, that plant to take off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to be probably the biggest
gap that you have from a watering
[SPEAKER_06]: perspective for the entire cycle of the
plant, short of when you first plant your
[SPEAKER_06]: rooted clone, the same sort of principles.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Brandon, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to get that stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, just you covered it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the same way that we're trying to
coax roots to come out of a plug,
[SPEAKER_04]: we want to do the same thing when we're
planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think Andrew and Ted covered
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing too, guys, if you are going to
be transplanting from one container,
[SPEAKER_02]: pulling it out of that, examine the roots,
look at it, and also keep an eye on the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil moisture of that pot or that
container that you're going to be going
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if that's dry enough and you water
your bed, it might not be getting
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That soil that in the first container
might be hydrophobic to the point where
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else and you're planted and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks good, but that cube might just
have shed water already and you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd want to make sure that you're at
the appropriate moisture level in your veg
[SPEAKER_02]: pots before you go into your beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you're going to think you're
doing fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might be another reason for
slowdown too, if people are thinking that,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I want my plants to be thirsty and
they dry them out a little too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're watering, but that stuff's
not even really registering to the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Brandon posted this in the chat.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because I know people aren't going to
be able to see the chat if they come back
[SPEAKER_06]: and watch the recording.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to get that into the
recording, which is that if you want to do
[SPEAKER_06]: a light compost tea, area compost tea or a
light fish hydrolysate application for
[SPEAKER_06]: that watering event that you do or
transplant, that can also help to just
[SPEAKER_06]: give them a little bit of available
nutrition as they're switching over into
[SPEAKER_06]: the new transplanted soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just a challenge for me when I
started with organics because I wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: used to having salt experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what's this stall out?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this one week, two week stall out?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have time for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The aerated compost tea and fish hydro
just gets me right through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, there's a question for you in the
chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your facility's protocol for
bringing in soil, bringing in soil back in
[SPEAKER_00]: from outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any IPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you reamending that soil before you
store it outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those amendments have time to break
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you watering in any microbes to
facilitate the breakdown?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: First is when we put it outside,
we do tie the tote up so it's not just got
[SPEAKER_02]: all sorts of nonsense falling into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We let it a solid year and that thing will
freeze and then get really hot and that
[SPEAKER_02]: whole cycle happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we do come bring it back in,
we do make our own lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll put some of that through there
and then it will get recharged with some
[SPEAKER_02]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing that's helping us
is it's not like it's going from a rested
[SPEAKER_02]: state to an empty bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also going to be going back in with
the native soil that's still being used in
[SPEAKER_02]: the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's going to be a lot of already
happy microbes and good things that's
[SPEAKER_02]: already there to compete with anything
that might be bad that's coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the other thing to think about
with organics is a lot of these big bad
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes that we talk about, they all have
competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our system, so yeah, they're probably
in there, but they're at such a low
[SPEAKER_02]: population number relative to the other
things just because they're all competing
[SPEAKER_02]: for the same resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really ever see any flare ups of
anything too gnarly, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: super good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do do a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We recharge with microbes, the compost
teas that we add.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try to bring out the populations of
the really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a fool's errand to try to
make sure that you're not going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: any bad guys in there because we're
talking about trying to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as long as you're giving your helpful
warriors enough food, rest, and whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: they should be able to outcompete anything
that's going to end up biting you in the
[SPEAKER_02]: butt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think regular applications of either
trichoderma or lab or rotating them is
[SPEAKER_04]: something every facility, like you could
get away with not doing it at home because
[SPEAKER_04]: if you lose a four by four, it's not the
end of the world, but a facility,
[SPEAKER_04]: it would be part of my protocol that I was
doing one of those every week.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to outcompete.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's one of the things that
lactobacillus, one of its exudates,
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the things that poops out is
oxalase.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oxalase helps drive terpene and
trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So win-win.
[SPEAKER_04]: But definitely be doing something to keep
your soil microbes, the good guys able to
[SPEAKER_04]: outcompete the bad guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all got, everybody in this chat's
got fusarium and botrytis on their face
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot exclude it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just outcompete it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a question from Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you use the pace test to help you
create a soil prescription?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does knowing what is in the soil
solution help you know what to put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's for you, Brandon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking at the pace test.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm using both.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use the MALIC-3, the soil report,
as kind of my savings account.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the pace reports, what's
available now, that's what's in your
[SPEAKER_04]: pocket or in your wallet, purse,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the pace, I'm mostly looking for bad
actors, chlorides.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at sulfur on the pace as
opposed to, I don't look at sulfur on the
[SPEAKER_04]: MALIC-3.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to see what's available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sulfur is something that, like phosphorus,
I'm also looking at the available
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: They both can sit in the soil for a long
time before they're liberated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really want to see what that
available level for both of those are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to see that available
phosphorus so I can compare it back to the
[SPEAKER_04]: reserve to see how efficiently you're
cycling.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a really nice reserve,
but you've got really poor cycling or low
[SPEAKER_04]: available phosphorus, then we're going to
look into why it's not, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: is it temperature?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there just not enough biology?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it not the right biology?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, microbial mass, mammoth pee,
tribus, I think somebody did ask about
[SPEAKER_04]: different phosphorus solubilized bacteria,
and those are three good ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen really good stuff already from
the microbial mass, the folks that are
[SPEAKER_04]: using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Microbial mass is also supposed to
liberate calcium, so another win-win.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to see those numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see if you, you know,
like I saw a bunch of tests today with
[SPEAKER_04]: really poor reserve, but better than
normal available.
[SPEAKER_04]: That tells me that the grower is feeding
some sort of, they're pHing with
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphoric acid, they're feeding with fish
hydrolysate, but they're doing some sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of supplemental feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that tells me something about the
grow so I can kind of understand what that
[SPEAKER_04]: grower's doing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I personally am trying to set my
grow up for a one-time pre-plant amendment
[SPEAKER_04]: application and that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, you know, I'll do my little
potassium thing at the end of week three,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, you know, that's how I'd like to do
my fertilizer routine so I don't have to
[SPEAKER_04]: worry about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just kind of forget about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also, you know, and then the real money
on the PACE report is the cations,
[SPEAKER_04]: and one, I'm looking for the actual
balance of what your plant is seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking for the, you know,
to try to hit my target metrics,
[SPEAKER_04]: but to make sure you're in balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to give me some information if
you're seeing something weird on your
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I'm going to look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do look at the MALIC-3 for the
cation numbers, but I, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can go back to book club and,
you know, doing Steve Solomon's approach
[SPEAKER_04]: which is, you know, I would agree that
that's the right approach for outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to balance off of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to look at sulfur,
phosphorus, everything on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with a potting substrate where the
total exchange capacity is just not
[SPEAKER_04]: accurate, we can't balance that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we need to see what's available to
the plant and the PACE report gives us a
[SPEAKER_04]: way to do that and a way to make sure that
there's sufficient nutrient in balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple of questions about
phosphorus cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've covered some of it,
Brandon, and we have talked about it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the book club.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recordings are all available on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pete asks, what are phosphorus sources and
bacteria that cycle phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Greg also, he's noticed through rounds
of amending that his beds, in his beds
[SPEAKER_00]: that phosphorus never seems to cycle at a
rate we'd want to see it at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked if there was any option to do
something like vermicomposting with bone
[SPEAKER_00]: meal to really target castings that would
be high in phosphorus while trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize heavy metal inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think Ted was just talking to
Bryant about some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as the specific biology,
I think we already touched on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff like microbial mass, mammoth P,
those are bacteria that specifically
[SPEAKER_04]: targets phosphorus solubilizing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be what I would use for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phosphorus sources.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about this in book club,
but in the pursuit of, and it was my
[SPEAKER_04]: challenge thing is heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the pursuit of managing heavy
metals, we've really reduced our rock
[SPEAKER_04]: inputs, our soft rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still a really good input.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like to do guanos just because
it's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bunch of environmental faults
and potential bacterial infections that
[SPEAKER_04]: can be passed along that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not the path forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fish bone or bovine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are really good sources.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to bring in nitrates as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just need to make sure that you're
balancing, that you're managing your
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrates so that you're low enough at the
end of the round that you can use bone
[SPEAKER_04]: meal or fish bone meal to bring in
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way you don't have to lean on soft
rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite is CalFos just based off the
California registry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has the best heavy metal numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the one I would use there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as far as compost and
vermicompost, that does seem to be,
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously that's going to be very labor
intensive and would depend on if,
[SPEAKER_04]: Greg is somebody that's obviously capable
and would be willing to do the labor to do
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Home grow, you just might not have the
space to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it might just be better to really
super low load up your reserves,
[SPEAKER_04]: go way over your target and then just do
weekly applications of microbial mass or
[SPEAKER_04]: manatee.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have read stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've not personally done it, but we talked
about that in book club as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think last week or the one before where
Steve was suggesting putting phosphorus
[SPEAKER_04]: sources into compost or vermicompost so
that would be, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: particle size and the more something's
broken down, the more readily available it
[SPEAKER_04]: will be and that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it would follow that adding
phosphorus source to compost would make it
[SPEAKER_04]: more available.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that would be a good long term
project.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't be a quick fix.
[SPEAKER_04]: A quick fix would be something like
Pacific Grow C-Fos, just a liquid low
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen cheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And pH and with phosphoric acid is a great
way to have available P. So I think I
[SPEAKER_04]: answered all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone have any final questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we get even close questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're about, we've covered about
maybe 50, 60% of questions and it came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, we, by all means, we can do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, or we can try and cover some of the
questions either on IG or on, on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have a lot of food for thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one, one note to add just cause,
well, two notes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first thing on the phosphorus thing
from a plant perspective, if your plant
[SPEAKER_06]: needs available phosphorus, phosphoric
acid is the best option, even though it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not organic, just in terms of the plant,
the plant doesn't care if your nitrate
[SPEAKER_06]: comes from calcium nitrate, not organic
or, you know, a fish meal, for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I just want to mention that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when people are thinking about options,
now fish, hydrolysate is stabilized with
[SPEAKER_06]: phosphoric acid and that's sort of the
cheat on the, in terms of the national
[SPEAKER_06]: organic program of what they allow because
it stabilizes the fish.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that some people are going to be like,
Nope, I'm not going to touch that because
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not true.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I totally respect that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for people that are less concerned
about that sort of organic, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: synthetic conventional argument,
phosphoric acid is the easiest way to get
[SPEAKER_06]: your P levels up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And bat guanos is too, is another one,
but there's a lot of reasons not to use
[SPEAKER_06]: those.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I see when people have bat guanos into
their soil, their available P is quite
[SPEAKER_06]: high.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just the other thing I want to
mention to you guys, totally unrelated to
[SPEAKER_06]: the Q and A, but we just set up the
discord.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you should be able to like share your
own grow on there and people can comment
[SPEAKER_06]: on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So people can have their own, you know,
posts or channels, and then we can all
[SPEAKER_06]: chat on there better than Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm going to send out an invite for
that to everybody tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to seeing everyone's
grow on there too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys want me to touch real quick
on a low heavy metal compost mix that
[SPEAKER_03]: people can try?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could just use peat moss because
peat moss is usually very low in heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: metals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've also found that,
so base of peat moss, which is probably
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be what's in your growing media
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll mix well if you're using it to
amend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can just add fish bone,
gypsum, and insect grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of those have very low levels of
arsenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gypsum will have a tiny bit of lead.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are worried about lead,
leave the gypsum out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you add something like ag lime or
other calcium sources, most of those come
[SPEAKER_03]: with some arsenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a battle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to pick most of the time between
arsenic or lead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, Calphos has a little bit of
both, which is why we've been reducing it
[SPEAKER_03]: in our mixes and leaning on the fish bone
because the fish bone is just super clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the insect frass that we have right
now is super clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could get a very high phosphorus
based casting with a good reserve of
[SPEAKER_03]: calcium that is virtually arsenic free
with a little bit of lead.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the gypsum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you take out the gypsum,
there is calcium in fish bone and worms
[SPEAKER_03]: naturally coat their castings in a calcium
bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there should in theory be enough
calcium without the gypsum, but the extra
[SPEAKER_03]: calcium and sulfate that comes with the
gypsum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that combination when we're talking
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So personally, if I was going to set up
like an ultra clean vermicomposting setup,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would amend peat moss.
[SPEAKER_03]: With insect frass, fish bone and gypsum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Add my worm population once I made sure
that that was not enough to heat up the
[SPEAKER_03]: peat in any way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once I know that it's a safe
environment, add your worms and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: really not going to be much of a resting
period needed for that type of a mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can hit us up if you want to know
the brands that we've tested because
[SPEAKER_06]: depending on where the gypsum is mined,
it will have different levels of heavy
[SPEAKER_06]: metals.
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't just think that all gypsum is the
same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are specifically the products that
we stock are the ones that we've tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't speak to every brand and gypsum
is one of those things where the lower the
[SPEAKER_03]: quality, the more heavy metals you'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't skimp on the gypsum just because
you think you can get it from the paint
[SPEAKER_03]: shop down the street.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good tip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can always get the brands that
we carry, but yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead and we'll use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was just saying those are good tips
and it's probably a good place to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Brian and Seb, we'll try and
address the other questions that came in
[SPEAKER_00]: some way somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we look forward to doing this
again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody, for coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the great questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
