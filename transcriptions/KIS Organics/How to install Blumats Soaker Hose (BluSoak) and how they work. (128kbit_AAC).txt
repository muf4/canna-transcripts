[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Tad Hussie here with KISS
Organics and I'm here today to talk to you
[SPEAKER_00]: about blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're unfamiliar with blue mats,
what they are is an automatic watering
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an irrigation system that works
without the need for electricity and keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants at optimal moisture content
throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can adjust these levels yourself
and it allows you to grow really happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think watering is one of those things
that gets underappreciated by a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and overlooked in a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the most important things
in organic soil or an organic growing
[SPEAKER_00]: system in terms of your overall plant
health and plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do for you today is
break down a little bit more about what
[SPEAKER_00]: blue mats are, show you a few different
designs, and then show you how to install
[SPEAKER_00]: them in your own garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the first step is to get the soil wet
into the right moisture content as if you
[SPEAKER_00]: had just watered and we're going to get it
set to what we consider optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with soils like ours, like the KISS
Organics, soils that are peat based,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what is most potting soils are,
you're going to find that the peat can be
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobic, which means if it gets really
dry, it's not going to want to accept
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm doing this on a record breaking
day here in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 88 degrees out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to really let this water soak
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to water another bed and come
back and water that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good watering technique to know
about in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the pulse watering technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look it up, but essentially let
the water soak in because peat can get
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means it's not going to want to
accept water when it gets really dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: then come back to that bed and then give
it a little bit more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really important, especially when
you're doing a container watering over
[SPEAKER_00]: numerous containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once that water is soaked in and I've
got that bed to the optimal moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: content that I want it at, then I can move
on with what I want to do next,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is start installing the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've let the water soak in a
little bit, I want to test it to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of moisture content I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to dig down a little bit to see,
make sure that the water is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrated beyond the first inch or so and
it's actually down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite enough to get a drop out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to just slowly want to break
apart there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do have a digital moisture
meter, it makes it really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to aim for a hundred M bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the digital moisture meter from
Blue Mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 50 bucks and they work
really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I've done that, I'm going to be
soaking my sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is something you'll want to start
doing while you're wetting the beds and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I let them sit for a couple hours and
now I'm putting them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm doing right here is getting all
of the air out and attaching them down
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want any air inside the Blue
Mat sensor itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm tapping it to remove any micro air
bubbles in both the top and the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: cone and then attaching them below the
water level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I'm going to do is attach
the pressure reducer to my hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in this case, I also showed the
optional filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're using tap water from a
municipal source like I am, it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just go straight off of the
pressure reducer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step is coming off of the
pressure reducer with an eight millimeter
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I'm using the black tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have an orange super flex tubing
that you can get if you are in an area
[SPEAKER_00]: that requires you to move around more
corners and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for my intents and purposes,
the black line works just fine and it
[SPEAKER_00]: blends in with my bed better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step is deciding where you
want the sensor in the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my case, I'm putting the sensor near
probably about four or five inches away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the base of my tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way I know that if that part of
the bed needs water, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: dispense water throughout the entire line
off of that sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just attached the blue soak adapter
to the blue soak tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that blue soak tape essentially
works like a soaker hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm running it over and towards my
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to get all of the plants
that I want it to reach in the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only going to sense the moisture
wherever I put that carrot, that blue mat
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is just going to go off of
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So originally I decided I was going to run
it underneath the tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ended up coming back here in a
second, as you'll see, and pulling it back
[SPEAKER_00]: out and putting it over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ideally you want to have your design
and your layout figured out early and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to install it when your plants are
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing about these systems,
when you do first put in a smaller plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is you may need to water, hand water over
the top until that plant gets established
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil and has a larger root ball and
ability to pull more moisture out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, my plants are obviously
maturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fairly large.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried about them getting
adequate water doing it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm laying out my line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I measured out about half of it here
because I need to loop it back around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that you have to remember is
it's only going to measure wherever that
[SPEAKER_00]: blue mat carrot or sensor is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to make sure that you come
back around with your blue mat tape or the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue soak tape to get within four to six
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to go four to five inches,
I'd say even, to that sensor itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way you can do that,
I know Blue Mat themselves recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in a distribution dripper right
off of the end there before you put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: three millimeter adapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've found that it works better for me
without using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you can't see right here is
I'm now putting on the end cap to the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: soak tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That keeps it from coming out the other
end and just laying it down right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapping it back around to that green
sensor that I put underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: The base of that tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's going to water all three of
those tomatoes, the cucumbers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers off of that one sensor alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different ways you can
do this design.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you a bunch of different options
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did three of my beds in this video so
you can kind of see the different ways I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave a few different ways of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really you'll want to figure out what
design works best for you and your crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how thorough do you need it
to water, how much of the bed you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really going to decide based
off of your budget, the value of your crop
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you lay it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really important, always overestimate
the length that you think you need so you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to reorder parts and just be
very thoughtful about the way that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: laying it out ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you have a design figured out,
it's really, really easy to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've gone ahead and fast
forwarded to save you the time of watching
[SPEAKER_00]: me lay out all the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially what I did was I put
another sensor in that corner closest to
[SPEAKER_00]: the back left tomato plant and then ran
the blue soap all the way down and around
[SPEAKER_00]: all the plants in the bed and then back to
that sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, ending about four to five inches
away from the sensor because it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important that the sensor, the area around
the sensor gets moisture the same as the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the roots and the rest of the
plant because that's what's going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: water out and sends when to release water
into the soaker hose itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't really see a lot of it,
but what I'm doing now is I'm attaching
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the line there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my last bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so off of those eight millimeter
sensors, you actually have, it's sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have one end in and one end out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the end coming out of that eight
millimeter line, I need to cap because
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise water would just flow right out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just putting a cap on there
right now to show that I'm ending the
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you a visual of that as well
here in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a quick shot just to show the
aesthetics of the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my case here, I put a 90 degree angle
on the eight millimeter line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a nice clean line down and then
just sent it down the bed and then under
[SPEAKER_00]: the gravel and then back up down the next
bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a close up of what the sensor
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how I ran the end of the
blue soap tape line back over to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this way I will make sure to keep that
area moist and it'll keep everything wet
[SPEAKER_00]: and watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see you have the blue mat sensor
connected to a three millimeter adapter to
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue soap tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the blue soap tape that goes
around the bed, looping back around and
[SPEAKER_00]: then ending underneath the stake with a
blue cap, a blue soap cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other line you see in there
is just the black eight millimeter line
[SPEAKER_00]: that connects my blue mat sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing just from a different angle
to give you guys another view of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's an end of that blue soap end
cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see it actually just screws on
to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just put it right inside the sleeve
and it fits on really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was my pepper bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did something a little funky here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to loop around the plant
completely and make sure that I got good
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage right around my peppers without
watering the rest of the bed because this
[SPEAKER_00]: bed is going to be under that hoop house
plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little harder for me to get in
there and weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by putting the soaker hose just around
the base of the plant, I'm hoping to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce my weed pressure in the middle of
the bed because that area doesn't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay as wet and also make sure that my
peppers get really, really good water
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the season because it's going
to be super hot under there and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow some awesome peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also extended it out to get the thyme
and the sage at the end of the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are getting good water too by
running the soaker hose over by the root
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a couple more traditional
designs that I've seen people use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either that spiral design going out to
cover about a four by four space or this
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of back and forth wavy design that I
used on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on your layout of
plants and what kind of coverage you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's just two more options to
consider when you're laying out your blue
[SPEAKER_00]: mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the soaker hose here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I opened up the carrots, it's around
a pepper right now and you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: water coming out of the soaker hose
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it'll look like when it's
dispensing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is where the sensor comes in
because as you close down the sensor and
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust it, which I'll demonstrate here in
a second, it will maintain that moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: content at whatever level you set it at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this soil, because I know what it
is, it's a peat based soil that we make
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really like to keep it right at 100
mbar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm going to aim for and
that's what I'm going to set my sensors
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now rain or shine, these things are
working for you day or night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your plant always gets an even moisture
level, which is so important for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it, for example, rains the next day,
those sensors will shut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we won't get more water into the
soaker hose until the plant needs it,
[SPEAKER_00]: until that soil starts drying out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the soaker hoses are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to want to use
distribution drippers and the distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: drippers are the little brown things with
the black tip that you can see in this
[SPEAKER_00]: photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put up to five per blue mat sensor
and they work really well if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with containers, say like a five
gallon container or a 10 gallon container,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can put a sensor in and then
run those distribution drippers around the
[SPEAKER_00]: base of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're onto the final step here
and that's dialing in your blue mats and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the sensor set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going ahead and closing up the
sensor because I had it open overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't put out enough water to where I
was concerned about overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people even run these without sensors
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't even need them in some
instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first thing to do is as you open
it up, if you open it all the way up and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get any water, there could be a
little kink there in your three millimeter
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that rubber gets stuck together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll just need to slide the line in
or out a little bit and just unkink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this case, you can see it's not
kinked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I'm going to do here is let it get
to where it's just dripping and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a drip just hanging there at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I know I have it at the right
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see I'm almost there and I just
want to get that drip hanging right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I'm going to do is look on the
side of the blue mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are these little arrows and I'm
going to move over one to two arrows
[SPEAKER_00]: tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clockwise, one to two arrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it really just depends on how wet you
want the soil to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my case, I only did one arrow
because I wanted to keep the soil a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit on the wetter side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also do two arrows, but it also
depends on how moist your bed is at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time of setting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use those moisture meters to
make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I would do is I'm going to leave
this and not make an adjustment now for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to wait at least probably 24
hours, 12 to 24 hours before coming back
[SPEAKER_00]: in and measuring with your moisture meter
and seeing where your bed's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you do make an adjustment,
make it a small adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe only one carat at a time so that
you're not overdoing it and constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: having to go back and forth and fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But provided you don't bump the sensor,
it should water your plant for the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: life of that plant now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't recommend these units enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And feel free to hit me up if you have any
