[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.

posts come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest today is Nelson Linsley of
Poetry of Plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check him out on Instagram under
Poetry of Plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelson has been cultivating cannabis for
over a decade and working in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: for over two decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: An artist by heart and an innovator by
trade, he has worked with the majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: leading grow room technology and
techniques that are available on the
[SPEAKER_01]: current market and studied their
application for efficient large-scale
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last three years, he has
consulted on sites in Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon, Colorado, Pennsylvania,
and California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, he is building a research and
development facility for the design of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar-specific study and working with
several of the leading LED horticultural
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting companies on implementing
technology in controlled environments
[SPEAKER_01]: before the products come to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelson and I hit it off immediately,
so I just started recording and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: listen in on where the conversation took
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to all your podcasts
and getting caught up on where the content
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's a lot of the times,
it's more of an interview in a way,
[SPEAKER_00]: less of a debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, maybe we could talk about it
off the cuff, but I did want to discuss
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the topics around pesticides and a
little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to go there,
that's totally fine too.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind debating.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to be right either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally open to whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither do I.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get into my feelings on the
perception of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a little time as a pest control
guy, doing inspections on homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got that job, that was something to
cover the bills while things are in
[SPEAKER_00]: transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also fascinating to go study
entomology and all these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went into it very, very, very
anti-pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at doing more studying around all
of that, I realized that when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: monocropping, you have a lot of challenges
and that's what we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new frontiers emerging with
biological pesticides that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest that people do a lot of
their own research on all of that instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of necessarily just jumping right into all
of these things are bad, all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things are evil and really looking into it
with an open mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying that they are good,
not saying that they are bad, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: parse the zealous religiosity and the
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a bit of bad information out
there and there's a lot of progress that
[SPEAKER_00]: we made.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I see happening culturally and I see
it a lot in cannabis is that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: religiosity about how to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to have that when I grow or
cultivate or look at a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm looking at a consulting project,
I look at what they're trying to achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's the most efficient way to
achieve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain things that they can and
cannot do based on the limitations that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have already set up by the building,
by the structure, by power, and by the
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations of the staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got a guy like David working
with you, you can go neck deep in a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, but if you've got a guy that's
never done any of that work before,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a lifetime of learning right there
just in the soil, just on the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people should explore all of it,
but sometimes it doesn't necessarily work
[SPEAKER_00]: to get people off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to talk to you about that a
little bit because I would love for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge me on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I talk about with David
frequently is challenge me on my
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology because I am open to make it
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a set methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at plant biology,
understanding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really feel like we know a percentage of
a percent of what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole economy going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just starting to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a photo biology seminar and
listened to some of these leading guys
[SPEAKER_00]: from colleges and talk about
photosynthesis and how little they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually understand of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That to me is like, whoa, okay,
wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of have some names and some terms
to label all this stuff that's going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these processes, but really it's very
close to magic in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just slowly uncovering what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on chemically with the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with fluorescence?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with heat?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with all of these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with phytochrome response?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get technical on that if you want
to, but that's the stuff that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then how does that work with a fungal
network, with a network of bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we remove that fungal and bacteria
network, what happens to the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we get a better plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we get a worse plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like taking away part of its
language?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that fungal network is part of its
language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we create that fungal network in
hydroponic systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: People will go, oh no, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have theories, but has anybody really
tried to execute on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain paradigms that people get
stuck in because they find something that
[SPEAKER_00]: works and they stay there, but that
doesn't mean that what they found is
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily the most efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to take us to the next level on
interacting with the planet in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable and ecological way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to challenge all of those belief
systems and really put them to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to do it in my own spaces that I
have that reign to get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you called me the other day,
I was playing around with something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had learned about from a large-scale
tomato guy and it didn't work on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I blew a whole run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything got cooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You deal with disappointment when you see
things like that because when you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener and a farmer, you get super
connected to the plant because the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough study coming out right
there that the plant actually has a type
[SPEAKER_00]: of feeling, a sensory system that we don't
fully understand yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You develop a relationship with a plant
and it's not in a language that what we
[SPEAKER_00]: share between human and human.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different kind of language and it
goes back centuries in human history in
[SPEAKER_00]: our relationship with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that there's a consciousness to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that there's something bigger
there that we don't fully understand yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be something that we are
capable of holding in our minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our minds are limited, but the universe is
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our relationship with the universe does
not have to be limited by our
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be almost like a Buddhist about it
and be moving in the rhythm and the flow
[SPEAKER_00]: and connect with it in a way where then
our thoughts become after as part of a
[SPEAKER_00]: reflection tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of trying to think our way through
it, sometimes it's just about quieting
[SPEAKER_00]: your mind and being in the garden and
allowing some of those things to come
[SPEAKER_00]: through you like a vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where a lot of creativity
and inspiration comes from because I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe creativity is finding the
similarity between dissimilar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking at growing plants
indoors, that's a very different
[SPEAKER_00]: environment than what plants are naturally
grown in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at what's going on with
the planet right now, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: man-made climate change or whether it's
just part of a cycle, we may have to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: how to really grow plants inside and
create environments to be able to still
[SPEAKER_00]: survive on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that I'm seeing more
frequently is so many large-scale grows
[SPEAKER_00]: for food production are moving to really
high enclosed greenhouse systems or in
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend of mine who sent me a
picture of a reflection of a building from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Freedom Tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a building that was across from the
Freedom Tower in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me this beautiful reflection of
the clouds and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see this reflection of this
building because you know what that
[SPEAKER_00]: building is in that reflection?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the largest indoor
cultivation spaces for produce and
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty herbs that I've ever seen in my
entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all indoors in this building in
downtown Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that where a lot of this
technology and research is going to end at
[SPEAKER_00]: is how are we going to grow food on
another planet?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to grow food in space?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have your own belief like we
shouldn't probably leave this planet and
[SPEAKER_00]: go corrupt other planets, but hopefully in
this process, we're going to learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: work more with all of these things and not
necessarily against them and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: everything as being disposable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be the lesson from this
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those kinds of things excite me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when I look at the indoor
environment and look at the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, look at the greenhouse
environment, I think right now in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space, there's a ton of money
going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an opportunity to really work on
developing technology where we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the funds to develop it, to grow
cannabis really efficiently, but also to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow food really efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I'm really passionate
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought up a lot of different things
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that really stuck with me and
everything you brought up there could be
[SPEAKER_01]: its own topic in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that stuck with me was the
methodology that you brought up and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: get so caught up with the one way of doing
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be fair, I know that I pushed the
organic paradigm.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, I was brought up with it by my
father.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some of the damages that have
been created by mineral salts to our
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, to our own health.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, that's the paradigm I'm stuck in
to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping talking to you today,
I can branch out and learn some new things
[SPEAKER_01]: and be more open-minded towards that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, I find that the cannabis
industry especially is really caught up in
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have indoor growers, versus outdoor
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have peat versus cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have organic versus chemical nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even within the organic world,
we have probiotic farmers versus
[SPEAKER_01]: biodynamic farmers versus Korean natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these guys are zealots,
like you said, in terms of what they
[SPEAKER_01]: believe and why their method is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm not here to say my method is
the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this style of growing that
David Perrone and Tim Willson and these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys are doing is a little more
sustainable from an environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in terms of improving on
efficiency and yield, there's still a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of room to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that soil science doesn't
know that much about the interaction with
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to a talk probably about five years
ago from a professor at Oregon State
[SPEAKER_01]: University.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was saying that we know more about
what's going on in space and in the ocean
[SPEAKER_01]: than we do with what's going on directly
under our feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would attribute that more to humans
putting their dreams above reality in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of ways because we're looking up at
the stars, looking at these unlimited
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, we've missed some of these
obvious things that require our attention
[SPEAKER_00]: right now to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of it, this is the crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things that are going up in the
sky, those are all patterns in geometry
[SPEAKER_00]: that have a lot of parallel with what's
going on below us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to get too esoteric,
but it's almost like if we look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt, if we understand the soil,
we'll understand the cosmos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at a microscope, the first
time you look at a microscope and looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at the bacteria going on in the soil,
I could have sworn I was watching some
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy psychedelic cartoon and that these
were creatures in another world,
[SPEAKER_00]: had no idea we were there in another
dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going about their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trading little bits of this,
little bits of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One little thing that looks like a tiny
little bear is bringing something over
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks like some nematode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're communicating, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The micro is a reflection of the macro in
a lot of ways, but what's most important
[SPEAKER_00]: right now is that, is understanding what's
right underneath our feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be really frustrating when you
think about how much time and energy has
[SPEAKER_00]: gone into things that are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cool to think about, but they're
not necessarily really part of our
[SPEAKER_00]: survival right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really part of being a
responsible race on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these religious texts talk about,
in a lot of ways, taking care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet, taking care of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the mineral salt conversation that we
can dive more into, I would suggest that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of that has to do with the abusive
methodologies, using that without being
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible, using some of these chemicals
without being responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at a place like Salinas,
Fiji Lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of cannabis growth going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in some of these greenhouses and
looked at half a million square feet of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about licensing or none of
this kind of stuff, but you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: their main problem is right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: The water coming out of the ground is at
2,000 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know why that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Run off from all these grows and egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not from the cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salinas used to be one of the biggest
growers of cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those greenhouses are all dilapidated
and run down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all went out of business after NAFTA
passed, because it was cheaper to get
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers from Ecuador and South America
than it was to grow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years, they were just running off all
those minerals right into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's coming back up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unusable water.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are installing really crazy
expensive reverse osmosis systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high-end reverse osmosis system is a
four to one clean to dirty water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're filtering out 2,000 parts per
million, what's the EC, what's the parts
[SPEAKER_00]: per million of that water going back into
the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be super, super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they doing to mitigate that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of nitrates, and I imagine
there's a lot of phosphates in what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're filtering out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some technology to handle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not necessarily with the phosphates
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still experimental, but there are
certain bacteria that will chew up those
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrates, turn that back into something
that we can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain products out there that
they're selling exactly that refuse from
[SPEAKER_00]: that bacteria as some miracle plant food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they're called a bio-generator or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might know the name of it,
but you can take that runoff and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: literally clean it with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand that this technology
is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing for the spaces that I'm
working at in Santa Rosa is we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to take all that waste and turn it back
into profit, turn it back into a resource,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what's going to drive this
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be the religiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be the tribalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, there's a bunch of
great people out there that really care
[SPEAKER_00]: about that, but what makes the world turn
is all this money.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we are going to make a change is we're
going to make a change through the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to look at everything that's
wasteful, and we have to turn that into
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we change the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do it through trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do it through the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to figure out creative ways of
taking that refuse, turning it into gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That technology is out there, and there
are people that have worked on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just hasn't been scaled yet because
there hasn't been an impetus for change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're an impetus for change,
and we have a huge impetus for change in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis business because we're more
regulated than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: California is a pro at regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not be so great at keeping the
streets together, but when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation, oh man, they're ball busters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to tell you, consulting and doing
these designs for these buildings and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about all these different
regulations and codes that go into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the greatest challenge I've ever had
in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other states that I've worked in have been
challenged but California has definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: been the most challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that do?
[SPEAKER_00]: That forces the people that are financing
these buildings to put in a couple extra
[SPEAKER_00]: million into this building.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're going to put that extra
million into are things that over the long
[SPEAKER_00]: term are going to pay off, whether that's
LED lighting, whether that's water
[SPEAKER_00]: recapture, reclamation, processing all of
your waste and turning it back into food,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge opportunity to be an
example to other industries in California
[SPEAKER_00]: right now through the regulation,
as long as you have the people with the
[SPEAKER_00]: money willing to see it as something
that's going to be best for them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: To some extent, California is just forcing
everybody to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one way, it's really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: In another way, it's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be highlighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that could be really,
really positive that could come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's executed properly and people don't
try and cut corners and do all the shifty
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that they've been doing in the black
and gray markets for the last 20 or 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I struggle with regulation because on one
hand, I feel sometimes it can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy handed.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, I see so many people
taking advantage of a lack of regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: or a lack of enforcement, especially in
the cannabis market with products
[SPEAKER_01]: containing Paclobutrazol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pesticides that were unlabeled or only
should be used on ornamental plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need consumer protection and it has to
come from the government because frankly,
[SPEAKER_01]: no one else has the power to enforce this
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that end, I feel a strong need for some
level of regulation enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other end, I totally hear and some
of these regulations can be really
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous and punitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a necessary evil right now as we
evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for me, trying to get my product
certified organic with the CDFA has been a
[SPEAKER_01]: massive challenge and it takes forever and
it's months and months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I have that, it carries a certain
weight to it to know that a consumer can
[SPEAKER_01]: trust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the point, the regulations are heavy
handed in a lot of ways and are arduous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they have no idea what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at this and they don't
know whether to label cannabis ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of industry label is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know this yet and I could be
wrong, but I don't know if the
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural pest control board is going
to be overseeing the chemicals used if the
[SPEAKER_00]: same standards are going to be applied
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they don't want to do that because
it's so regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might get in trouble for saying this,
but cannabis is going to be so regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: and so looked at that maybe their own
practices in the agricultural world will
[SPEAKER_00]: then be scrutinized just as much as
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a benefit that could come
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some things that need to be more
regulated and need to be looked at more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to do real testing on these
pesticides and their long-term effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: human beings and their short-term effect
and to identify, is this the next DDT or
[SPEAKER_00]: is it not the next DDT?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know DDT was a bad pesticide and the
pesticide industry has done a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going to hate me for saying
this, but they've done a lot of really
[SPEAKER_00]: good things and allowing us to have a
constant source of food supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got real comfortable and lazy with
being able to not have to grow our food
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, but that's not the way it was for
thousands and thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just spray the chemicals on it and the
plants grow and then we get some food and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe not the greatest food.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get comfortable with it so there's
no reason for it to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there might be a reason for it to
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a better way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might need to be more innovation
done in the agricultural space and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: that will come from cannabis because the
big agricultural players are getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the regulation drives me a little
crazy because I look at it and I go,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that doesn't make any sense at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that tell me?
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells me the people that are writing
the regulations, they need more help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked in customer service before and
if someone's just yelling at me and upset
[SPEAKER_00]: at me, I don't want to help that person
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if someone comes to me and says,
I've got a problem and I really could use
[SPEAKER_00]: your help and they connect with me from a
human to human level and we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: what the problem is and why it doesn't
make sense and we have a rational
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation without the emotionality,
without the religiosity, I'll tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: what, I think we can get some stuff done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can move past some of the
tribalism and really work on all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some gatekeepers in the way,
but you've got good groups like the SCG A
[SPEAKER_00]: who have been working on writing these
regulations and it's taking forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new set of CDFA regulations,
I think they're slated to come out in
[SPEAKER_00]: October and we're going to have an
opportunity to make some changes there,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the whole aisle thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've even looked at
that, but that's a whole crazy thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: won't get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you count canopy?
[SPEAKER_00]: How they count canopy and all these other
kinds of things and how people have taken
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of some of these canopy
definitions and why they're looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, are you aware of this whole
canopy thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have 10 feet of space
between the plants, otherwise it counts as
[SPEAKER_00]: your canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have different regulations down in
California than we do up here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes, here in Washington, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say that because I know all of
our listeners are not just in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I get enough interest, maybe we can
have you back on to talk more about
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with everything you're saying and
I think you and I should talk off air for
[SPEAKER_01]: a while because I think we can't get into
more of the esoteric stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's dive into some of the stuff that can
be real practical for growers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I think you really shine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see using this hybrid method,
but I hear a passion from you towards
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sound like a hardcore organic grower
the way you talk about the planet and the
[SPEAKER_01]: way you talk about these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we say hybrid method, as I understand
it, you're using a combination of organics
[SPEAKER_01]: and mineral salts for chemical nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into that, I want to tell
you a quick story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found out about this website,
bigpumpkins.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a forum and it's all the giant
pumpkin growers community.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were using our compost teas back when
we were just a compost tea company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a few of them contact me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call them heavy hitters if you've
gotten over a thousand pound pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting about this is you think
cannabis guys are crazy and passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: about their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here with the giant pumpkin community,
you have guys that are growing from seed
[SPEAKER_01]: to literally thousands of pounds in the
period of less than a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their plant's not worth anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing a high value crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: People use it recreationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: People use it medically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has all these medicinal benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you're literally just growing a giant
gourd for no other reason than you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a big giant gourd.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dedicated a small part of my food garden
now to growing one just out of curiosity
[SPEAKER_01]: and enjoyment for the act of just watching
something grow so quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to this hybrid method,
they were growing with chemical nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: strictly for a long time up until about
1996 when they got their first 1,000 pound
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics were improving, so I don't want
to take away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genetics have been constantly
improving, but they started mixing in
[SPEAKER_01]: things like mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That became a big thing in the pumpkin
industry right about that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they started incorporating more and
more organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now most giant pumpkin growers and all the
world records, when we talk about just
[SPEAKER_01]: straight yield, are using a combination of
biologicals, which would be the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: side, and then these ionic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The current world record set in 2016 is
2,624 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's over 1,600 pounds of growth in a
decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to attribute a lot of that to
genetics because they do a really good job
[SPEAKER_01]: with that in that community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have to give some credit too to
this hybrid method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it with cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the biggest yields and best plants
I've seen have used a combination of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear your thoughts on what
exactly you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm currently using is a very low EC
mineral salt blend that I've put together
[SPEAKER_00]: in combination with FPF, lots of kelp,
some molasses, some other sweeteners,
[SPEAKER_00]: natural sweeteners, some cane sugar from
here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then using aloe powder, using willow bark,
and using some some microbiological teas,
[SPEAKER_00]: some fungal teas, that I'll brew in
conjunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a set schedule for the teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do it by feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at the plants and I look at what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a decision based on what's
happening with the plants and the growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: which really is based on how high I've got
the light intensity, how high I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to push photosynthetic rates, and how fast
the plant is transpiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to segue a little bit into
the PPFD and that importance of really
[SPEAKER_00]: dialing down your fertilizer, because when
you're running a higher PPFD, the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: will transpire more, which means the
plant's going to require more water and
[SPEAKER_00]: less concentration of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That methodology almost led me into using
a lower mineral salt dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was growing strictly in a
quote-unquote living soil blend where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was in the amendments,
I was having trouble with the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration rates balancing out the
fertilizer uptake that was naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that I would want to get back
to that to dial that in and figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: where I went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really haven't seen anybody yet,
and I'm open to someone showing me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I haven't seen anybody yet grow under
high PPFD indoors in a living soil without
[SPEAKER_00]: having a few imbalances come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That led me into creating a mineral salt
blend to address those imbalances that
[SPEAKER_00]: were coming up from the high transpiration
rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tried living soils and then switched
back to chemical nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did this path start, and what sort
of meaty are you currently growing in?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started cultivating,
I was learning everything from the hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of bottled nutrients,
and this was over a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was rockwool and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a room that I decided I was going to
go organic in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used a peat moss base and gave it all
organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the best quality, best yielding
room out of any of the hydro setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had shifted completely from that point
to organic, but I was getting reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started working with other guys,
and they were getting reduced yields as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was under a single-ended
high-pressure sodium bulb, so really at
[SPEAKER_00]: best, you're getting 400, 500 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of light, but the quality was
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to figure out a way of
negotiating the quality and the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get both.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last 10 years, organic cultivation
has come a long way, and there are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of guys that are getting fantastic yields
from just using straight organic mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I was looking to dial it in a
little bit more when I moved to the LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, because the LED lighting had a
whole other set of challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like learning how to grow all for
the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had gotten recommendations from a few
gentlemen up in Oregon, one being Jeremy
[SPEAKER_00]: Plum, a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was talking about the living soil,
the terpene production, and then that
[SPEAKER_00]: coupled with the LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back into a living soil
methodology, and I was doing that as a
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant for one of the grows,
and it didn't go as we expected,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I had to make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went and tested some of the
different batches of amendments I was
[SPEAKER_00]: using, I was finding that there were
certain minerals, like heavy metals and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, that were showing up,
and there was not a lot of consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: between batches of amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really concerning to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was having all these problems,
I called some PhD friends of mine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant world, and they were talking to me,
and we were having creative conversations
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth trying to diagnose what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, you need to do leaf tissue
sample tests and soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never done that before, and this was
a little over two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a laboratory in El Segundo called
Wallace Labs, and they will do cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought down sample samples to them and
soil samples and got these analysis back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, whoa, I'm way off the Richter
with certain things and way under with
[SPEAKER_00]: other things, and there's all this copper
and aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did all this come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back to a base peat moss media,
because that always seemed to work well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and started to introduce mineral salts
again with lighter amendments in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the soil tests are coming back
that my fertility was through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have gone overboard with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working with some blends that people
had recommended, and it just didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to almost relearn that whole process
with growing under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This brings up a few different questions
for me, but let's start with the recipes
[SPEAKER_01]: that you used when you were doing living
soils and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they really, really high in rock
dust?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's where you were picking
up a lot of your heavy metal content?
[SPEAKER_00]: The heavy metal content wasn't coming in
on the rock dust analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was coming in on, I was using a
composted cow manure, and that's where it
[SPEAKER_00]: was coming in from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The batches were different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a consistent mineral blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a consistent mineral content
in each tote, so I'd get a tote of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we would test that, and then we
would test the other one, and it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: radically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, there's a lot on the line
for a lot of these guys that are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: off the ground, and there's not a lot of
room for experimentation for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, unless you're working on a
boutique small-scale level, and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the space to do that R&D, which I
recommend everyone do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that everyone's getting in
this space, have an R&D room to test out
[SPEAKER_00]: and try different methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the big issue, and then there was
certain Bokashi's and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to name all of the
amendments, because some of them could be
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated to a brand, and I don't want to
throw anybody under the bus, but there was
[SPEAKER_00]: just things that were coming in where I
stopped trusting the amendment companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped trusting them, and there's an
amendment company that I use now for my
[SPEAKER_00]: blend, and they do all the soil testing
and all the analysis, very similar to what
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are doing, and I get results back
on every batch, and I can trust that when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting in to the media, it's going to
work well, and that media is peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I am running trials with Rockwool
because I'm specking out and designing
[SPEAKER_00]: these vertical rack grows, and when you're
putting peat moss or cocoa up 10 feet in
[SPEAKER_00]: the air, that's a nightmare for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very practical, and also,
it's a safety hazard, and until we have
[SPEAKER_00]: robots in the grow room that can be
lifting and moving these things for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will happen soon at some point,
I think in the next five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll start seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like Rockwool or some other
types of almost like Styrofoam media is an
[SPEAKER_00]: easier way for the operations to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why if you see Rockwool on my
Instagram and all that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite is peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the organics in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a light mineral salt with a ton of
kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with you on the whole
potassium hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, on a side note with the kelp,
the kelp's got all kinds of good other
[SPEAKER_00]: things, other good hormones, and you can
combine that with salicylic acid and other
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can combine that to create a similar
effect that people are getting from Paclo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to know that you can get
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using Paclo or have been using
Paclo, hopefully, they stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is terrible, and it really
causes major problems with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough data out there to show
that, but you can create all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: effects that people use synthetics on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that we can find that in nature
and apply that to get the plant to express
[SPEAKER_00]: itself in a similar way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tighten up the nodal spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can do that with high doses of
kelp and with some other botanicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can redistribute the auxins to
auxiliary branches by a combination of low
[SPEAKER_00]: stress and high stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant training techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really where the secret is in
getting high yields is training those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, which takes a little bit more
time, but it's almost like sculpting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy watching the plant grow
into a shape to fill up the canopy where
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a lot of tops very close
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you get those higher yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring up plant stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: A question I have in that regard would be
I've seen a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obvious that plant stress has an
effect on the flower or the fruit or the
[SPEAKER_01]: bud of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times, it's in a positive way
when that stress occurs at the right time
[SPEAKER_01]: in a plant's life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: One story I really liked is in Italy,
they would actually flood their tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: valleys with salt water as a way of
raising salinity, stressing the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it creates a much healthier,
better tasting tomato on the final crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't yet seen enough research to
really show when that stress should occur
[SPEAKER_01]: in a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you have more information
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how many times I've heard
this story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, oh man, I neglected my plant or
something happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got mites, whatever, but the bud that
came out of it was the best I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant was so stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like it was going to die,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any more experience or
anything you want to share in that regard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people understand that the
psychoactive chemical compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: produce in cannabis are a defense
mechanism to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting that something that's
poisonous for everything else in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: is medicine to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's just brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother Nature, she's a savage beast doing
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as timing on plant training,
I think it really depends on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a loaded question because every
cultivar is going to have its own
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology and you have to really study
and learn your cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've stressed the plant out, not in one
run, but I've definitely tried different
[SPEAKER_00]: stress techniques at every point in the
plant's growth to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as what I found that works,
the best is to start shaping the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly early on when it's maybe had 10 to
14 days of vegetative time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has enough strength to handle a little
bit of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll usually like to start with a low
stress technique if you can afford the
[SPEAKER_00]: time to do it, which would be tying down
some branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great guy on, I'm going to plug
another guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know him personally, but I follow
his feed on Instagram called
[SPEAKER_00]: lightaddict420.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is like the stress king.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a death star, literally a cannabis
plant in the shape of a death star,
[SPEAKER_00]: put a light in the center of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it took him like two years to
train this plant out and flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does this other technique called
fluxing, which I think he's starting auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering or very early on seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He splits the plant and then bends all of
the branches down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then ties them down flat on the top of the
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant looks haggard, like,
oh my God, how is it still alive when he's
[SPEAKER_00]: done with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: The final product that comes out is just
mind blowing when you look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For him, it's like an art project.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at some of bonsai techniques
and apply a little bit of this and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of that to it, I think you'll
have some interesting results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it doesn't work on every strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains just stop or they slow down
or they have problems or it was too
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're stressing a plant,
you can also introduce bad things into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant because you're breaking the
epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be very careful when you're
doing things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a safer bet to use low
stress techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll typically train the plant,
try and get it to have a structure that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I look at a small plant, when I look
at a small immature vegetative plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: I try and imagine what it's going to grow
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at its current structure and I look
at where the geometry of that current
[SPEAKER_00]: structure could use a little help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will ease it into that little help at
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as it's about to go into flower,
I'll be more aggressive with it to get
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a shape that's going to work
within the trellising system and within
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy and within the plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from weeks one, two and three,
I'll continue to weave that plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: inside and out of the trellis while it's
undergoing the stretch process.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that stretch process, the stems are
still malleable, but once they harden off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really don't want to do any more
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the point where you're
like, okay, I'm done with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the stems lose their softness and
you can increase that softness by spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: a little water or running a higher
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I run a much higher humidity in the
first three weeks of flower than most
[SPEAKER_00]: people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people think I'm that crazy for doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little study on the vapor pressure
differential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of a believer of running higher
humidity in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a colder temperature, that's another
thing too, I like to run a colder
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the leaf surface temperature
to be above 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the people listening out there,
if you're just looking at a thermostat in
[SPEAKER_00]: your room and you're not measuring your
leaf surface temperature, you're doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong because that's not the temperature
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be looking at the temperature
of the plant and then look at the ambient
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and you want to be comparing
those two when you're dialing in your
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little side note.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an infrared thermometer then that
you use to measure leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can get on Amazon for like 10,
20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good way to get an idea of
what's going on with your transpiration
[SPEAKER_00]: rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at CO2 consumption, you look at
leaf surface temperature and you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You watch the growth of the plant and you
can chart these things or you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: some nifty environmental meter in the room
that can map it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that everyone stay away from
the technology at first and that they go
[SPEAKER_00]: in their room and they take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an Excel spreadsheet with all the
metrics on it and whenever I'm initially
[SPEAKER_00]: starting a room, I write everything down
because that forces me to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're just looking at a computer
screen, you're not looking at the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I have to go in and I have to take
all the measurements by hand, I discover
[SPEAKER_00]: new things every time I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you miss that process or just relying
on technology, you do not have a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with the plant and you need
to have a relationship with the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not only database but
sensory-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will also lead you in the correct
direction on how to train the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those stems have lost their
malleability, which is usually around week
[SPEAKER_00]: three, and you start to gradually decrease
the relative humidity, which is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: usually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually start at a higher humidity
around 70% and around 72 to 75 degree leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature and then I gradually
bring that down after the stretch happens
[SPEAKER_00]: where I land around 55% humidity and I
will ramp up the temperature for a period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time when the bud sets have already
happened and the flowers are really
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to come in and that's where
you're getting that bulking period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll increase the heat a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a higher transpiration rate,
a higher photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might get a little damage to the leaf
but I understand that's part of the cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of getting a high yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the science says is that 85 degree
leaf surface temperature is peak
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay away from that because you
have to have a perfect environment to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to hit that peak photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I'm in an indoor environment
that's not going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give the plant a little bit more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have cooler temperatures,
I find that the stress isn't expressed as
[SPEAKER_00]: fast so you have more time to make an
adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running at a warmer temperature
or higher CO2 and you're really pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, when you make a mistake,
things go south real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can lower some of those metrics,
give yourself a little bit higher humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beginning, you'll have a little bit
more flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's a lot of great information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked a lot of what you had to
say, especially around humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when I first started growing,
it was like you take your plant and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have your metal halide for veg and your
HPS for flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take your plants and once it reaches
the size you want to flour it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just flip the switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pop it into the HPS room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You drop your humidity 20% overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does stress the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Jaya was actually the one,
I know you know Jaya as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got me really looking at VPD and
looking at how we can make this transition
[SPEAKER_01]: much smoother and healthier for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we introduce a real large vector
for disease and stress at that transition
[SPEAKER_01]: into flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're typically transplanting right around
that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're changing all these environmental
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many things we could talk
about, but let's dive in a little bit on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned already that you start at
60% humidity going into flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: 70%.
[SPEAKER_01]: 70% going into flour and then you lower it
slowly from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing with the lights
throughout this as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning, the lights are,
again, it depends on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at the surface area of the leaf to
make a determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my photon net right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got something like a Durban poison
or a Golden Goat, which is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting structure, it's got these
skinny little leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to treat that different than I
would a heavy indica or a black domino or
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of cush strain that's got a
broader leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would look at that a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of trials where I have 60
cultivars in a small space just to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll run one whole environment on it and
then see which ones respond to what,
[SPEAKER_00]: take notes on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I run that, I'm not going to do this
and I'm not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing I like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way of broadly looking at a
lot of cultivars and doing research on
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a foundation starting point for
each cultivar when you go into it instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of flying blind and losing a whole room
and being really bummed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lose a whole room if I've
got 60 different cultivars in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to lose some of them and some of
them are going to do really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll be able to identify which ones
did really well in that environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to identify which ones don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I start all these cultivars,
I'm running at a fairly low PPFD and I
[SPEAKER_00]: usually match that with whatever it was
coming in from the veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll go 10-20% below what that
is as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go a little bit lower than where it
was at just to give it a moment because
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got a totally different biochemical
thing going on now which takes energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when photons hit the plant is
it's either going to turn into a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: change, a form of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's three different forms of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could either be chemical, fluorescence,
which is reflecting light back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they call biofluorescence or
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want is I want as much chemical
change to happen as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want fluorescence and I don't want
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get some fluorescence no
matter what and I'm going to get some heat
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what, but I don't want excesses
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want it to be focusing on
chemical change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing what happens outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside, it's a gradual shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the times change and then you
get to 15 hours of light and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: start to move into flower and they're
massaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're yoga-ing their way into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, wham, bam, thank you,
ma'am.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of guys are running 24 hours of
light in their veg and then they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a crazy hard start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start easy and gradually ramp it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say start easy, I'm usually around
150 to 250 micromole, which is fairly low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone out here that wants to do this
kind of work, they need to get a PAR meter
[SPEAKER_00]: that reads PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reads micromole.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have that, you shouldn't be
reading lux.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be reading lumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has nothing to do with what the
plants are receiving on a light level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to plug a brand here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there one that you'd recommend that
you've used that you like a lot for people
[SPEAKER_01]: to check out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a Lycor meter for a while that was
really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 1,500 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I used an Apogee, which was $500,
$600, $700.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Hydrofarm one that I'm using
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a couple of hundred dollars that
works fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it reads that within the
acceptable PAR range, then you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't necessarily a particular
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the sensors are all sourced from
the same place, unless you go to Lycor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lycor has really high quality scientific
sensors, but I'm not getting any
[SPEAKER_00]: difference with the Lycor meter than I am
with the Hydrofarm meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, this is a new thing that
they're getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go out and buy a $1,500 PAR meter if
you're just getting into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gradually move up to those kinds of things
because they have more functionality that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cheap Hydrofarm one works fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say get the most bang for your
buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be spending a lot more on
the lighting as it is when you go to LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one problem with the LED
lighting is it's still relatively new
[SPEAKER_00]: technology and it's expensive,
although I don't really know if it costs
[SPEAKER_00]: that much to make all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it costs a lot to market it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where we're incurring a lot
of the added expense onto LEDs because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that the technology has gotten to
the point where they can mass produce it
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly cheaply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited to see those prices come
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little nudge nudge to all the LED
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all the rebates that are out there,
you'd basically be getting a light for
[SPEAKER_00]: free if they would figure out a way of
producing it a little bit cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these companies are the ones making
all the money right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so much all the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hard job, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know this,
but you've got a bad run and it sets you
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that are selling the picks and
shovels, the bullets and band-aids,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are the ones that are winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to push on them to continue
to help us with success.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some companies out there that have
been doing a great job with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other companies that are really
capitalizing off the bubble and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really like them very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with the capitalism,
but we've got to be able to build this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in the right way and we need as
much help as we can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the people that have been
fighting for this industry for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, 30 years are going to lose it to
companies like Philip Morris.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I don't want to have happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I get a little religious.
[SPEAKER_00]: These major big companies are going to
come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't fight for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fought for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lucky that I didn't go to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been sitting here developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother is a brain cancer survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing medicine for people that
couldn't afford the pharmaceuticals or the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals were killing them even
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that this was something that
should be available to everybody and we
[SPEAKER_00]: fought for it and we should be the ones
that should be able to be here at that
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a little side note on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't all work together,
guess what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to turn into everything else
that's happened with this country and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be big business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come into the chaos and
swoop it up and then we're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry is going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's make sure that we're there being
intelligent about how we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Side note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally went on a tangent.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a good rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I want to have a friend of mine,
Shango Los, who has a podcast called
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire on at some point to talk
exactly about that because I think we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to lose a lot of our genetic
diversity when big business moves in
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're not going to be able to grow
it and it's going to be crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I talk to you a little bit about that
real quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we do, I don't want to forget
this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to reach out for growers that
maybe they have four plants and they can't
[SPEAKER_01]: afford a light meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you recommend for them to do in
terms of that transition with lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say let's talk about single
ended HPS as well because that's still
[SPEAKER_01]: around for a lot of people and that's what
they can afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, LED is a great pipe dream for a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's some useful information or just
general rules that people could go about
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're not able to do this level of
testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so we've got like a guy growing for
himself on a closet level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of times, I mean, I can't take
all of them, but I help a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: guys out through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a lot of questions all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing that you can do is
crowdsource your troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that's very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that Instagram has turned
into the new forum for growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can actually freely share pictures
and data with each other and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that the first number one rule
is less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like we have this tendency to
be like, oh, my God, it can go to 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it to 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like go less is more with your fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less is more with your light intensity
because it's way easier to correct a
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency than it is to correct a
toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know that once it's toxic,
it's burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dead leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's deficient, you can make those
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring that back into the soil and
you can increase the light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the high pressure sodium bulb,
with a single and a high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb, most of the ballasts that power them
really only have three or four dimming
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be like 50 percent,
75 percent, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like some 110 percent,
which is like some weird spinal tap
[SPEAKER_00]: reference, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes to 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that you really want to
gradually bring the light up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that by raising and
lowering the hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't afford a par meter,
you can absolutely afford an IR
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're growing with high pressure
sodium, I think that's more important for
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of reasons because you've got all
that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that your leaf
surface temperature is not exceeding 78
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees if you're just starting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can keep it at 72, 75, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going above 75 degrees,
you better be injecting CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plant's going to have trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cheap ways of doing that without
needing a CO2 regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that with some, there's like
those bag of, what is it, those bag of
[SPEAKER_00]: spores that create CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget what they're called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're doing, oh, goodness,
if you're doing a living soil bed in your
[SPEAKER_00]: tent, then that and you're adding worms
and you're adding, I mean, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be creating your own CO2
naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to want to exhaust that
out during the nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've had living soil beds get up
to like three thousand, four thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million in the nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of CO2 just from the natural biological
process that's going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one recommendation of increasing
the CO2 so you can match a higher light
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the general rule of thumb is less is
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gradually bring the light down,
gradually bring up the intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time, the week, if you're running a 65
day strain, usually you want to be ramping
[SPEAKER_00]: up that light and be at peak light around
weeks four, five, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you want to get Samantha
cyanide production, where the hues of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower change, you can dim the light a
little bit and lower the temperature for
[SPEAKER_00]: the final weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're flushing, you know, the most
organic guys aren't flushing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this those final two weeks,
if you lower that temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a little old school trick that a
lot of people know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get some purples and reds and some
really interesting colors to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't seen that as much with real
high light intensity and cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually it's almost like you're
simulating a season in two months or nine
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives, you know, a little bit of
actionable information without having to
[SPEAKER_01]: go out and buy a bunch of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I will politely disagree with you on
one thing you said, go ahead, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: crowdsourcing your problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I want to caution people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm in a few forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will put up a photo of a bug and
you'll get 10 different answers for what
[SPEAKER_01]: that bug is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't possibly be all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, oh, be selected with who you turn to
for your information is what I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: point out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I didn't think about that yet
because I don't really go on the forums so
[SPEAKER_00]: much because there's some bad there's a
lot of bad information on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if you're getting your information
from somewhere, you know, don't get it out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the basement, you know, is my
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of plant scientists on
social media now and a lot of them want to
[SPEAKER_00]: enter into the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I've capitalized off of that
100 percent where there's been,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plant scientists and some of
them won't work with cannabis people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some of them do because they would
like an entry point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so there's people that
actually know what they're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's something to to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of times there's a bug or
something that I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a fraction of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times I'll post an image up
and I'll be like, hey, I think this is
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll get a list of things and
then I'll do my research on it because at
[SPEAKER_00]: least it gave me a starting point.
Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that that would be instead of
blindly going out there, throw it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: see what people say and the people that
answer correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those are the people you want a
direct message.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I see a lot of is why does my plant
look like this on the leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next thing you know,
you see it's calcium, it's magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's potassium, it's phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could also be lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be the way your water,
you know, there's so many variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, I just I see this all the
time and it just makes me really nervous
[SPEAKER_01]: for people because then they're going out
and they're applying CalBag and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they're applying worm castings and then
they're applying, you know, all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you don't know what's going on
with the plant at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we just really need to
emphasize that for people and just be
[SPEAKER_01]: careful with your with who you're getting
recommendations for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I just want to mention this
forum that Tim Wilson and I started a few
[SPEAKER_01]: years back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no advertising on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just for the most part science based
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called LogicalGardener.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nelson, I'd love to have you check it
out, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of great stuff on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you are.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I'm going to get on it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wrote it down and I will I will
re-enter the forum space because of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's not super popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a few hundred people on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the information on there is really
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tim Wilson is a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just honored to consider him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a friend and someone that has taught
me so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you, he really challenges
conventional belief just because someone
[SPEAKER_01]: said, I don't know, compost foam on
compost tea is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to go out there and look at it
under a microscope and come back and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, maybe maybe it doesn't make a
difference if there's some or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's related to saponin content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not related to microbial life in the
tea or maybe humic acids aren't good in
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea.
