[SPEAKER_01]: So when they bought this land probably
five years ago, the only thing on this
[SPEAKER_01]: property was this barn out here and the
big wooden structure and that was a grain
[SPEAKER_01]: silo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there wasn't water, there wasn't any
power and it was just kind of a wide open
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this has happened in the last
five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the original greenhouse that we had
kind of built.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice though because I just visited
Paradise Organics, you know, and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: retrofitting into a building so you have
all these, you know, things not
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily where you want them to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and that's really common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and there still is a lot of that
here because, I mean, there are so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different stages of this build.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, first it was the little
greenhouse that we built with just a
[SPEAKER_01]: generator and, you know, plug in power
tools and digging.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see this was kind of like the
start of the second stage was this back
[SPEAKER_01]: half and then the other nexus that's
connected to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was, the third stage was that
building so we added another 3,000 square
[SPEAKER_01]: feet onto that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fourth stage, which where we're
going to now, is we built this as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational passed in Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was our project.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Danny does all the facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, you know, doing anything that A
breaks down or designing any of the
[SPEAKER_05]: plumbing, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also have Jared who does all of our
flowering greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got Connor and Woody who manage the
propagation department, which is moms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we've got Sawyer who does IPM.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've kind of taken it a little
further than either of us originally just
[SPEAKER_05]: because at this scale you are
specializing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So each of these beds represents one of
our banger strains that we replicate and
[SPEAKER_05]: continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see that we're in a system right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in a complete revamp to make our
mulch layer something more sustainable and
[SPEAKER_05]: hopefully reusable.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's really caused this was having
shortages in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we knew we wanted to eventually,
over the years we've done living mulches,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done wood chips.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you do two wood chips, four runs in
a row with these year round greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to get obvious problems with
potentially nitrogen robin that doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: break down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to evolve to a system where we're
either using something reusable that's
[SPEAKER_05]: roll up and put, and you can put it back
down or we'll rotate through cocoa one
[SPEAKER_05]: time that gets stirred in wood chips one
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've played around with recycling our own
hemp fiber, but all that does is clog up
[SPEAKER_05]: wood chippers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're in R&D on both Scrog systems,
mulch systems, and what's our third rock?
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought we had one more for R&D.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the main things that we're still
like trying to develop something that's
[SPEAKER_05]: scalable, reusable and works well.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, we'll, if possible,
we'll scrape some of that mulch,
[SPEAKER_05]: that wood chip off.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we'll only use wood chips once
a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't ever use them in the mom room
because wood chips come from outside of
[SPEAKER_05]: the nursery and we ain't messing with
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why, another reason why we kind of
like cocoa, but wood chips, we'll use them
[SPEAKER_05]: and you'll see them in our, in our hoop
houses.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great thing because we're only
running one run a year in there and those
[SPEAKER_05]: wood chips aren't, haven't been a factor
at all at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think when you're getting four
cycles a year or four and a half,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're much more likely to have that
issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the big thing we do is we don't use
wood chips a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll only use it maybe once a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cocoa was our tried and true, even though
it was kind of expensive, it's a byproduct
[SPEAKER_05]: and it just gets stirred right back into
the soil when we amend.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll test these pretty frequently,
usually two weeks before harvest in the
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouses as needed for these.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's any issues or when he's sending
soil pests in, Connor will take core
[SPEAKER_05]: samples of all this and send those into
otherwise this because it's consistent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one reason we don't have mom room
in a greenhouse is consistency year round.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the only like year round
air conditioned spots that we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just so that we don't have to hit
a moving target with varying light
[SPEAKER_05]: intensities and temperatures and humidity
is where mom room needs to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_05]: No wool top dress the after the
reamending.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll top dress, put the craft mix
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes we'll lightly stir that in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it'll just kind of stay on the
top and get watered in depends on if it's
[SPEAKER_04]: taking the soil tests.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see Jared soil calculator if you
want.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's kind of made his own version of,
you know, all those other ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we'll amend based on those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously mom rooms a little bit different
prescription than the flowering rooms will
[SPEAKER_05]: top dress that essentially craft mix,
just a series of all our base amendments.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'll plant and we'll put the cocoa
on after.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the mom room gets all hand
watered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else has irrigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's go ask them.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going, Woody?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Ted Hussey.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just asking if you have already
amended this bed as you're doing your top,
[SPEAKER_05]: as you're doing your planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we just started like a chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: We numbered all the beds so we can keep
track of like monthly for how often beds
[SPEAKER_02]: are needing food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these beds, I just toyed plants on them
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the new ones that are going in,
they're the ones that were here got
[SPEAKER_02]: amended a little over a month ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to just add some as being
transplanted today and start them off and
[SPEAKER_02]: add some like this in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see you have some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a fish meal and gypsum.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what we've been rocking
with in our list of amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly Nigerian.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the mom room, they start to get
too green, just don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they start to get too yellow,
they do a test that we can top dress the
[SPEAKER_05]: craft mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: We usually don't do any leaf tissue tests
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that we haven't, but doesn't seem to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this the old moms is what you chopped
out of there or is this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he just killed something that we don't
need.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we sit down every month and plan out
our next planting cycles, maybe we have
[SPEAKER_05]: too much in inventory.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing's not selling.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll balance that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we have moms that have only been
used one time or not at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully not at all if we've done our job
right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or hopefully not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we get them?
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you supporting them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Danny made these Unistrat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I ran into this problem trying to do
pallets and tray and then the plastic
[SPEAKER_04]: pallets just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Handle the weight, the wheel weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Unistrat is my best friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, since I've started growing about
eight years ago, I've just started using
[SPEAKER_01]: Unistrat for just about anything I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so versatile, easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many different types of
bracketry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw your tray on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so all of our, so all of our beds
in our greenhouses too, we built,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pretty much a very similar
design except for they're not on wheels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how clean you guys keep it in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That drain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having that drain is awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these were actually just plugged
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll obviously top all the moms,
move it into here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll spend you know, usually
approximately 14 days, sometimes 12 until
[SPEAKER_05]: we are rooted and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: At that point, they'll get moved into the
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason we obviously bring you into the
tissue culture room first, the mom room
[SPEAKER_05]: second, the clone room third, and then
we'll go to the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has more flow as a harvest system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're doing is we're following,
if you picture this grow as a river,
[SPEAKER_05]: we always start at the top of the river
upstream, top of the stream at the
[SPEAKER_05]: cleanest spaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we move through just assuming that
your oldest plants or your harvested
[SPEAKER_05]: plants have the most potential to be what
we would consider unclean.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it flows better with the grow and the
harvest than it does with the tour because
[SPEAKER_05]: we end up zigzagging.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our greenhouses are all staggered three
weeks apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we'll start at the most freshly
planted, going to the most soon to be
[SPEAKER_05]: harvested at the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those will, it'll all flow according
to their age class.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, these lights were,
we got a bunch of these lights with the
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture lab kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and we just had a bunch of extras and
we're like, ah, yeah, we've noticed if we
[SPEAKER_01]: give them any more light, they tend to
yellow out a little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they definitely liked, you know,
less light from what we've been seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've tried a few different of,
you know, the luxe, LED lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: the clone lights, you know, a few
different, you know, your typical,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, single T5s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, these have been
actually working pretty well for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the luxe where we're getting yellowed
out in the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe it's just because, you know,
we could probably dial that in and feed
[SPEAKER_05]: more, but this is, why would you advance
anything past or buy more expensive
[SPEAKER_05]: lighting when this has just done the trick
so perfectly for us?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then are you dipping the cuts in
anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, zero tall, zero tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to say it's hygienic.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a dunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as far as the rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, we've gone through everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we using right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, currently we're using the Athena
rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've tried every single thing
possible, including nothing, had just
[SPEAKER_05]: about as good results.
[SPEAKER_05]: We rotate through, we used to do aloe.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the things that we used to do
that were more KNF didn't scale that well,
[SPEAKER_05]: at least not in an effective manner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've kind of like phased out
certain, you know, even what we found is
[SPEAKER_05]: we can get away with less T's when we used
to be just, you can imagine the scale,
[SPEAKER_05]: what kind of T's we're brewing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've kind of been doing less and less
of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen no negative results from
that either.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are all on rolling tables.
[SPEAKER_05]: We usually do six inch pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where we found we used to make all
of our own soil for the whole facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is actually where the most impact
for us has been for kiss soil is what we
[SPEAKER_05]: found.
[SPEAKER_05]: We cannot make it and have the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: We showed you those pictures a couple of
years ago of like the side by sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was noticeable at scale a couple of
times in a row.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point, we started buying kiss
every time for our veg soil, even though
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously we don't have huge soil needs
once our living soil systems are in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, at this scale, there's still quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's part of why we use six inch
pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can almost get just as good of growth
in two weeks, two to three weeks in a
[SPEAKER_05]: bedroom and two weeks veg in the
greenhouse, letting them tap in before
[SPEAKER_05]: flipping with our four greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: You end up having a harvest every three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if these spend two weeks in here,
you always have three days on either end
[SPEAKER_05]: to clean, run, or if something ever gets
pushed, you've got a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_05]: window.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have another bedroom for spring
planting season.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the same size.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll use that if we need to.
[SPEAKER_05]: But generally speaking, we're trying to
have a high utilization rate on our
[SPEAKER_05]: bedroom, high utilization rate on our
clone room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our system is all planned pretty much
perfectly for where we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is our first round of an
experiment with a new mulch layer that we
[SPEAKER_05]: were hoping to be reusable.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can already see there's some flaws in
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is recycled hemp fiber that Danny
found.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of the people are using this
for microgreens and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a company out of Canada,
Terra Fiber, that makes a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: mats as far as weed suppression for
microgreens, erosion control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of thought it'd be kind of fun
to test it out as a mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your thoughts on it right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I don't know if we'll stick to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we'll go back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was kind of a really cool
thought in using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's going to be very easy
to pull them back out of the beds after
[SPEAKER_01]: the round is over and then reuse them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need two runs to be competitive with
the price of cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it looks like it'll just pull
right out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those roots are going to grow into the
bottom with a bunch of soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way you're rolling up that
much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then how are you going to pressure
wash it in the winter?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some rubber stuff, but I'm a
little bit worried about like leaching
[SPEAKER_05]: that we could, you know, like rubber
matting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also I'm concerned that it's
going to do what peat moss would also do,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is hold a lot of moisture on the top
and kind of become a sponge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And instead of like just trapping it,
it's going to actually evaporate into the
[SPEAKER_05]: air, which defeats the whole point.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we're pretty well dehewed up
for winter runs in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The main reason for this then is just
moisture retention.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your biggest battle here with
humidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want it in the air that could
then promote mildew or just battling,
[SPEAKER_05]: making our dehumidifiers work excess.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also what we'll find and we'll show
you in zone three there is when we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have any mulch, you start to get exposed
roots, a little bit of compaction,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're way more light.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so much harder to read.
[SPEAKER_05]: That first of all, soil moisture,
because the top's always dry and you get
[SPEAKER_05]: dye off in those, that top surface layer,
you'll start to get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_05]: yellowing at inconsistent times or a
little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just becomes harder to read it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You lose your stability when you're
evaporating that much soil and you're more
[SPEAKER_05]: likely to just have regional attrition.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, certain leaves will fade out a
week or two before you want them versus
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the beauty of cocoa was it could just
be stirred in and game over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I love the idea of a mulch,
but what I struggle with is the biggest
[SPEAKER_04]: thing on scale is being able to reamend
those things quickly and be able to just
[SPEAKER_04]: mix whatever it is into the media without
really changing your physical properties
[SPEAKER_04]: of the media.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could see where cocoa might work for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fairly neutral.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not doing a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not very sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what we're looking for
is a more sustainable, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term uses that we can reuse.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sustainable in that it's a byproduct,
but not in that we have to ship it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also... The carbon footprint on
it is pretty terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're trying to revisit all these
things and find cost-efficient
[SPEAKER_05]: alternatives besides just as this market
gets more and more competitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, having a living soil system
is going to be never having to replace the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil after our... And oh, by the way,
these two greenhouses are all kiss soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the big order we put in with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we found is we got these finished
out two months before recreational was
[SPEAKER_05]: launching.
[SPEAKER_05]: And typically we would have built our own
soil and we had prepped to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were not in a position during harvest
to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after testing it in the bedroom
and seeing what happened, it was like we
[SPEAKER_05]: pulled the trigger on scale and boy,
we haven't looked back as far as that's
[SPEAKER_05]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you saw the lights just kicked on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that about?
[SPEAKER_05]: This Wadsworth system.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we have, which is our control system.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a light sensor right there,
that blue thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because it's cloudy out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these LED lights are all dimmable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously it's cloudy right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Typically, these are only one week into...
They were transplanted one week ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're still just at the end of their
shock phase.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first day of the curtains.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lights have been open all the way and
the curtains have been open all the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the parameters just got turned up just
a little bit to like 400 or 500 bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why these are now kicking on.
[SPEAKER_05]: This winter we're going to drop these
lights actually a little bit because
[SPEAKER_05]: they're dimmable.
[SPEAKER_05]: We maybe went a little high and a little
under lit, a little conservative on three
[SPEAKER_05]: cycles a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great with all the supplemental
sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have a cold cloudy December,
we're maybe just a little deficient on
[SPEAKER_05]: light.
[SPEAKER_05]: We called you last winter when we had that
issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think between the CO2 burner being
kicked on at a time when they were already
[SPEAKER_05]: underperforming with their PAR levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we're a little actually
deficient on our soil tests.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the humidity was really high because
it was winter and you end up getting high
[SPEAKER_05]: humidity in the winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're always battling that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why there's quite a bit of...
There's more than all my vehicles I've
[SPEAKER_05]: ever bought in dehumidifiers in this
facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's for largely three months a
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of the time we're running super
efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: Montana is a great climate for winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wet walls with our warm, dry, but not too
hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is Danny.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a great example of where we
all design out big systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we wanted to maximize our square
footage and canopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these greenhouses are actually 4,200
square feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those other ones are 3,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I were to do it all over, they'd all be
3,500.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of having six rows and four rows,
we'd have five in each one.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd have perfect consistency.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is an example where what we found
was with our dehumidifiers back there not
[SPEAKER_05]: blocking light, we were starting to get
mildew in the wintertime on the front rows
[SPEAKER_05]: where we were maybe having not as good a
cycling.
[SPEAKER_05]: At that time we had VAF fans, not HAF
fans.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we did in this size, we have them
on the other one because they worked just
[SPEAKER_05]: fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we weren't being able to stir our air
well enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we added everything we could.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started... First we added more
dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we added...
[SPEAKER_05]: We reconfigured our airflow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it was summer and we didn't have any
problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we thought we figured it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then last winter we added these.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now what we're doing is we're flipping
sooner and growing shorter canopies,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially during that winter month.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're gonna have to drop the lights in
order to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are... We'll never have a problem
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We solve every issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see these have already had their
transplant leaf up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been... These have all been pruned
from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: One week in, we've been really good at
avoiding transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can still see the remnants on a touch
of saggy leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: But overall, if they had even a little bit
of micro yelling at this point,
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be concerned.
[SPEAKER_05]: These beds are like rehab to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if they were to get unhealthy,
which we don't let them, they tap in and
[SPEAKER_05]: two weeks later we flip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you seeing CO2 levels elevate at night
with this much soil in them?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the summer... Depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they get too high, we will have some on
occasions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fans will kind of burp the greenhouse and
kind of maintain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't go up too, too high.
[SPEAKER_05]: In an empty greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: In an empty greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, they generally will come up to
about anywhere from 600 to 700 PPMs at
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_05]: The interesting thing though is an empty
greenhouse will outperform these beds with
[SPEAKER_05]: no plants to suck up all that CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will outperform that CO2 burner all day
long.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get it up to like 12 and 1500 on an
empty greenhouse right after we've turned
[SPEAKER_05]: the beds.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to waste or amended in new
microbes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the first year, now there's a
little bit more volume on these
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouses, but there's also
correspondingly more soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our beds that we made that were more
mature outperformed CO2 wise from a CO2
[SPEAKER_05]: production standpoint significantly over
the KISS organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I haven't seen any dramatic
differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it actually has to like... The
soil almost produces more CO2 or our
[SPEAKER_05]: sensors are off.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for a long time, the KISS greenhouse
is empty, would only get up to 600 and the
[SPEAKER_05]: nexuses would get up to 12, 13,
1400 at night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all these floor fans too, it's just max
airflow that we cannot get enough as long
[SPEAKER_05]: as it's not blasting on the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wet walls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect for this climate.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are hot, we're dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You use a wet wall in Florida,
you can't get that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But first of all, we hardly ever have a
day over 90 anyways, one or two a summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we could get this 20 or 30 degrees
cooler than ambient any time we want.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've never been too hot unless a break or
blue or a, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we do get alarms, four or five
different cultivators will say,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, it's too hot in zone four,
what's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you can see the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now these lights are reading on different
cycles.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we found, especially in these North
greenhouses was the winter sun was getting
[SPEAKER_05]: blocked on the south two rows.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we program these lights,
I had these two put on his own and those
[SPEAKER_05]: four.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll actually read and I could set
them differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's less applicable to the south
greenhouse, but especially in that North
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse, those lights would be running
24 hours a day, even are not 24,
[SPEAKER_05]: 12 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on a sunny day, the North borough of
lights will just let the sun take over as
[SPEAKER_05]: needed and the shaded sections of the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can really micromanage accordingly
with our settings.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, now we can do it from our
phone with the Wadsworth system,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can have every single parameter you've
got outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got zone one, two, three,
four temperature humidity, your par
[SPEAKER_05]: levels, your VPD and your CO2 levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now on a day like today or in the
summer, we won't run CO2 burners at all
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's just it's a part in the wind.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this big change here is that instead
of the old days of having to stoke wood
[SPEAKER_05]: stoves at midnight, three and six a.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if I wake up in the middle of the
night on a 40 below night in the middle of
[SPEAKER_05]: winter, I can look at this and just make
sure that everything's OK and there's no
[SPEAKER_05]: emergencies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Green crack, that's sativa leaning.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Don Fuego.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a strain that we bred out of two
of our legends, which are one of our best
[SPEAKER_05]: selling cannabis cup winning strains,
which is Donnie Burger and sweet and sour,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a strain we bred ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the baby of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're trying to always stay ahead
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We proved it over in my shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is only the first commercial run
we've ever done of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're pretty excited about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: New release coming up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don Fuego.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can really see strain specific
sativa time as you walk towards the more
[SPEAKER_05]: Indica's.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see that short that stacking there
way further along.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually, we're going to plant just
greenhouses, sativas, just greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_05]: Indicas.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we actually like that harvest spacing
right now for the size of our crews to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to do a five day harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can even spread it over 10 days
depending on my timing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But eventually, it's going to make more
sense for perfect utilization of veg and
[SPEAKER_05]: clone rooms to have 70 day greenhouses and
60 day greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have significant problems and we
stick to our system.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't go looking for them too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't tell you how many times people
have brought me a immature aphid or a
[SPEAKER_05]: winged aphid and everyone loses their
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And more often than not, the living soil
system handles any pests.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're usually able to get through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we did our job right all up until
there, as far as bugs are concerned,
[SPEAKER_05]: either we don't have to worry about them
or the ones there are are so minimal or so
[SPEAKER_05]: miniscule that launching a war halfway
through flower when we've got more
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouses coming has in fact done us
more good than bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have insecticidal, so root drenched
plants and more bad than good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have insecticidal root drenched plants
because of soil aphids that people told us
[SPEAKER_05]: were root aphids that weren't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just about fried a whole
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our treatments have literally done
more damage when we go aggressive out of
[SPEAKER_05]: our comfort zone and do more than a small
tester.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do more damage than good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't panic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, you put that soil in a
microscope, someone professional is going
[SPEAKER_05]: to tell me there's something to be scared
of in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, the health of the plants
tell you everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another interesting thing to note,
Golden Goat very specifically is one of
[SPEAKER_05]: our best prayers in this kiss soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe a lot of it is our light.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tends to get this light crab claw.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we reduce our transpiration by not
having as intensive light.
[SPEAKER_05]: And but for the longest time, I was like,
maybe this kiss soil is like too rich.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I couldn't figure out why my best
praying strain had.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's subtle, but it's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's our light intensity,
this dropping of the light, we're just
[SPEAKER_05]: slightly out of our parameter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is one of our indicators.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, because it's a short one,
it doesn't get quite as much light to say
[SPEAKER_05]: Donnie burger, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: This greenhouse, though, a little bit
smaller.
[SPEAKER_05]: We typically have way less problems with
mildew or anything of that nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, here we go right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That freak show seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also the first thing that's going
to harm if you have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to think that some of our oldest
strains would get that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that they did have hop, but they
haven't ever seen any significant impacts
[SPEAKER_05]: from that specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And furthermore, I have brand new phenos
that we just phenohunted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll randomly do that on the second
run in my shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never tracked it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't actually impact that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is a curiosity that everybody who's
known their salt has always wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: blame on hop late.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not been the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, four strains, one, two,
three, four, five, five strains in this
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are actually pretty lower testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one of my favorite strains
smell that living fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so living soil really brings out
those terms.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it tests 16%.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not going to sell that good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're about to win a war joint
supplement.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we're growing this is to
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why Donnie burger, which is 33%
gets grown in every single greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_05]: even though I between you and me hate to
grow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the worst, lankiest, least producing
finicky little thing you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that bad, but it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, the forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's I'm not personally a big fan of
high testing, you know, THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: My those days are over for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would much rather, you know,
to have a higher terpene profile and just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, still be able to function.
[SPEAKER_05]: Golden Goats, my second favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an island skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just smell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells like it belongs in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and this is a sativa one,
not a particularly frosty.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's late to the party on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a legend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of the test time, even though this
is only like a 22 percenter, she still
[SPEAKER_05]: stays on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a Montana cult classic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely a legend strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll go from basically it gets
harvested and all gets wheeled in on dry
[SPEAKER_05]: flower hangers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've reduced a whole bunch of touch
points on this farm by just the harvest
[SPEAKER_05]: crew will hang it in a dry flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, it used to.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a dry flower hanging.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another.
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: He made these originally kind of for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a game changer for us as far
as reducing touch points at the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: It used to be that you would harvest,
put it in a bin, bring it over to somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: at a station.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would take it out of the bin and
leave all their plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would get stuck in another bin,
brought to the drying room, hung on some
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of screen system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So each branch had to be hung manually by
hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when they go to take it off after
14 days, they got to unthread out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: netting or ropes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, with this, you reduce all those
touch points.
[SPEAKER_05]: They harvest it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They leave it right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They stick it on a dry flower rack.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes on to here, which gets pushed in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, then you just take the whole thing
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the real beauty of the system,
it used to be a giant scrub.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would touch every branch one more time
here to take this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take this half, you throw it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take this half, you throw it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You literally can just strip these down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it can be brought to the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: We reduced three entire touch points with
the dry flower system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can now fit just as much room.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have every kind of infrastructure you
can imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried with winches on racks that
raise the whole thing as you load it so
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't have to be up on a ladder and
dry flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get a product that you really
love and makes your life easier,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's totally worth promoting it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another interesting thing is
where there's so much space in this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry for renovation and innovation is
that when we first ordered these,
[SPEAKER_05]: they would send these aluminum lengths of
light because of shipping costs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was more than the price of the dry
flower hangers, which is what I want,
[SPEAKER_05]: was these metal things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Danny was like, look, if you just
cut, Danny clipped them all and he made
[SPEAKER_05]: them work on unistruck.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he told dry flower, hey,
instead of having to spend twice as much
[SPEAKER_05]: on shipping, just send everybody these and
make it unistruck, which is available at
[SPEAKER_05]: every home depot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you already know Danny's love for
unistruck.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then they custom made not just for us,
which I just found out they stopped doing,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I don't know why, because that changes
his whole game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I mean, there can't be very much
money in just giving all of it to
[SPEAKER_05]: shipping.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's way easier to ship thousands of
these than it is these long lengths.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just those little things of like,
don't use some aluminum prefab specific
[SPEAKER_05]: size thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Use a readily available building material
that is it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is off right now, but you can see
there's airflow, air conditioner,
[SPEAKER_05]: humidifier, dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got all the things to keep it at 60%
humidity, 60 degrees, and some elementary
[SPEAKER_05]: with seasonal fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the same thing, except for they
just took this down, bucked it,
[SPEAKER_05]: and now it's going to sit here while it
waits to be trimmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is where we'll put all of our
flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll basically it's been, it's kind of
curing now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be trimmed sometime in the next
week.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get a little more in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same deal, waiting for bucking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just sits in these bins, closed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one whole greenhouse in here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, that's one greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so this is where we process all
capsules, carts, and sometimes packaged
[SPEAKER_05]: pre-orders for wholesale.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a capsule brand that we're just
about to release in Montana.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going on people's shelves here
probably within the week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's finally just master packed out
and ready for retail ready sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a niche in the market that isn't well
represented.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a huge force in the market,
but there's nobody in that space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we already have a big following with
our capsules and we already had all the
[SPEAKER_05]: machinery.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it makes perfect sense to be
acknowledged as a threatening third-party
[SPEAKER_05]: brand that is available on other people's
shelves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I heard here in Montana in the
dispensaries they call it deli style
[SPEAKER_04]: because they just throw all the buds in
the jar and you're not necessarily
[SPEAKER_04]: branded.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's only a few dispensaries actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Typically speaking, like we're all
pre-packaged now, but we try and do that
[SPEAKER_05]: in a fresh manner because it's just the
way the regulations have pushed us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to do deli style and some people
still do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's strain by strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just get a big jar and you pick what
you want and they weigh it out in front of
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make it hard though as a
cultivator to build a brand if you're a
[SPEAKER_04]: grower because they're just throwing in a
jar?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not necessarily promoting the
grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do two types of wholesale.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is package and branding and the way we
avoid that is it goes in our packaging
[SPEAKER_05]: before it leaves our facility and then you
don't have a choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it kind of depends on which market
we're in.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a market we're already well
represented in, we don't need to get the
[SPEAKER_05]: brand or maybe we have something that's
starting to get six months old and
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody wants to white label it as their
own.
[SPEAKER_05]: In which case, it's yours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do what you want with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The consumers are looking on the shelves
now for a collective elevation because
[SPEAKER_05]: you've built... 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as Montana goes, we're a reasonably
renowned name for even our open source
[SPEAKER_05]: information.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cultivators know who we are and now
that those cultivators are actually
[SPEAKER_05]: outselling their capacity, they're coming
to us often times first.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crucial.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be retail ready and branded.
Thank you.
