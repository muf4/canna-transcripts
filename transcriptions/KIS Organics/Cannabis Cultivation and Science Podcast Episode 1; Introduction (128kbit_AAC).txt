[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw in top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first episode is just to give some
background on why I created this podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and what sort of cultivation I believe is
the future of cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much of the information surrounding
cannabis is myth and speculation that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been spread through internet forums,
and poor science.
[SPEAKER_00]: My aim with this podcast is to bridge the
gap between horticulture and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growers based on our experience,
scientifically supported principles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to debunk many of the myths
surrounding this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is intended to be a resource
for both beginner and longtime growers
[SPEAKER_00]: alike and to bring together the existing
body of knowledge in one location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not intended to be an exhaustive work
on all the ways and equipment you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, our goal is to focus on
sustainable and organic cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: methods using the best practices available
based on current research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of this research has come from long
hours reading journal articles and
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions with people far smarter than
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked hard to make cannabis
cultivation more sustainable and
[SPEAKER_00]: economically viable for growers,
as well as focusing on organics to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: the safest and most effective medicine to
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're currently a chemical
nutrient or hydrogrower, I'd ask that
[SPEAKER_00]: before you turn this podcast off,
please hear me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics is no longer some hippie idea
where you're sacrificing quality or yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: but rather the path to growing the highest
quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a commercial grower and this
is your livelihood, then I think it's even
[SPEAKER_00]: more important that you stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more traditional cultivation
techniques of buying cheap soils or
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile media that then require bottled
nutrients to feed your plant are outdated
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, they do work, but they are way too
expensive and many of these ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: can be sourced in raw form, saving the
grower a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason you don't see general
hydroponics or advanced nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural world or being used on
commercial basil or tomato crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention the excessive nitrates and
phosphates polluting our groundwater when
[SPEAKER_00]: growers dispose of their spent soil and
the labor required to constantly be moving
[SPEAKER_00]: soil in and out of the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: These types of programs and cultivation we
discuss in this podcast have an average
[SPEAKER_00]: cost on a commercial scale of one to five
cents per gram or under $5 a pound by the
[SPEAKER_00]: second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for both your media and nutrients,
along with the added benefit of reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: labor inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been working with growers now who
have been reusing the same soil for over
[SPEAKER_00]: five years and getting really consistent
yields over two pounds per light indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: and commanding top dollar in dispensaries
and stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of talented growers who
have even gotten over three pounds per
[SPEAKER_00]: light or 60 grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while some of what we do is
proprietary, like our soil mix recipes,
[SPEAKER_00]: my goal with this podcast is to get as
much information out to growers as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible so everyone can save money,
be more sustainable and organic without
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrificing plant health and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to give you a little background on
myself, so you can see where I'm coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the owner of Keep It Simple Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do business as Keep It Simple Farm or
KISS Farm, which you can check out at www
[SPEAKER_00]: .kisfarm.com and also KISS Organics at www
.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: KISS Farm is our seven acre brick and
mortar farm and feed store where we are
[SPEAKER_00]: all about urban farming and growing your
own food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a farm and feed store,
organic hydro shop and garden center,
[SPEAKER_00]: edible nursery, outdoor preschool and
production greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow thousands of organic veggie starts
for the community and also have a U-Pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an edible nursery where we feature
unique edibles and medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, with the farm and feed
store, we have chickens, ducks,
[SPEAKER_00]: cats, pigs, turkeys, bees and goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the animals free range and coexist
on the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful location that is bordered
by a salmon spawning stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a nonprofit organization set
up just for giving educational tours on
[SPEAKER_00]: the salmon and native habitats throughout
the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're ever in the Seattle area,
make your way out to Redmond and check us
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: KISS Organics is our gardening and soil
branch that is specifically focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: helping growers and gardeners source high
quality soils, nutrients, compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies and soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This all came about because I grew up with
my parents running a retail nursery and
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always around plants and forced to
work long summers as a laborer for the
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance and construction crews.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tough work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I learned a lot from hands on
experience, it wasn't something I really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went off to college at the University of
Washington and wasn't really interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: After undergrad, I went back to school at
Macquarie University in Sydney,
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia to pursue a master's degree in
special education.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got out of school, my parents had
sold the nursery business and my father
[SPEAKER_00]: had started a business making compost tea
brewing systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried a few odd jobs, but ultimately
decided to come back and help my father
[SPEAKER_00]: with running the compost tea business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a new industry and he had just
finished conducting experiments with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elaine Ingham of Soil Food Web in
determining such things as optimal brew
[SPEAKER_00]: length, dissolved oxygen levels,
and if pathogens like E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli could survive the brewing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fun time because it was a really
a brand new industry and anyone with a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of patience and a microscope could test
out their own theories and further the
[SPEAKER_00]: body of knowledge around this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to hear people like Dr. Ingham and
Jeff Lowenfeld speak and read everything I
[SPEAKER_00]: could on the topic to educate myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having just finished grad school where I
was forced to read peer-reviewed journal
[SPEAKER_00]: articles and studies all day was a great
background for wading through the
[SPEAKER_00]: information available on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through this process, I got to know Jeff
personally and also met a gentleman named
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Wilson, who at the time was also
active in a Yahoo group on compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: that Jeff moderated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was only a few hours north of me in
Vancouver, Canada, and actually took the
[SPEAKER_00]: time to come down and teach me how to best
identify these microorganisms and really
[SPEAKER_00]: use the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught me to challenge conventional
beliefs and not just accept something as
[SPEAKER_00]: fact just because an expert happened to
say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: During his week visit, we conducted a
variety of experiments that I still
[SPEAKER_00]: reference today regarding humic acids in
compost teas, brewing lengths,
[SPEAKER_00]: various microbial products, and much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the past 15 years, I've been so
fortunate to meet a lot of really
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligent and passionate individuals who
have furthered my own knowledge and I felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was important to create a platform
to share this information more publicly,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember my first time seeing a cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost a mystical experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was visiting a friend and he took me
down into his basement and all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: senses were overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights were way too bright,
the humidity was super high, and the smell
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of the room was so intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of what he told me about his growing
process seemed to clash with what I had
[SPEAKER_00]: learned from my parents from growing up
around the nursery and in our own
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why were we throwing away the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were these fancy bottles I'd never
heard of?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never seen them before at a garden
center and rather than being a plain label
[SPEAKER_00]: with an ingredient list, they had
cartoonish figures of monster plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: girls in bikinis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while all of this was going on,
I had done some searches for aerated
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea on Google and the two websites
that really stood out to me were one on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis called ICMAG where I joined the
Organic Soil Forum as CT Guy and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: was a giant pumpkin forum called
BigPumpkins.com where I joined using my
[SPEAKER_00]: real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two groups of growers growing
entirely different plants both had a
[SPEAKER_00]: passion that went beyond what I was used
to seeing from backyard gardeners and were
[SPEAKER_00]: really pushing the envelope in regards to
plant size and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giant pumpkin growers, for example,
start with a seed in the spring and finish
[SPEAKER_00]: in the fall with a pumpkin over 2,000
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time of this recording,
the current world record is 2,624 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me back up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about 10 years ago that I went to a
hydro shop in Portland, Oregon with my
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope to give a talk on aerated
compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have posted something on ICMAG
about it because Clackamas Coot showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet him in person and we started
talking about soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really sparked my interest as to how
we could develop soils that were more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable without sacrificing plant
quality and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through many long phone conversations,
he was able to help guide me in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios and sourcing amendments so I could
nail down the best inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was just beginning to experiment with
soil recipes and testing, a guy by the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of Jaya Palmer stopped by.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had done a bunch of internet research
regarding compost teas and found that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were one of the few companies doing
microscope work and lab testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: happened to be local.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he showed up, I was literally mixing
my very first batch of our water only soil
[SPEAKER_00]: mix in the driveway in one of those
compost tumblers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after talking for a bit, we hit it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave him some soil to take home and
try out with his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, prior to this, Jaya had tried just
about every line of organic bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a botanic care user at the time,
but also doing compost teas and other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: After growing a plant in my soil and just
using water, where he got comparable
[SPEAKER_00]: yields for less work and nutrient costs,
he was sold on the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, we worked hand in hand in
refining the process, doing lab testing on
[SPEAKER_00]: successive grows to determine optimal
levels for reamending the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: With his help, we were able to keep the
same soil in production for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to having Jaya on the
show here soon to tell his story as he is
[SPEAKER_00]: a wealth of information and one of the
smartest and most passionate growers I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever met.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little history about me and my
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the basis of our gardening
practices that make them different than
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional growing techniques?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for starters, I think we need to
look at cannabis as a high value
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural crop and treat it as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, it's an amazing plant with many
medicinal and recreational properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that doesn't mean we need to ignore
the existing body of agricultural and
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural research like much of the
bottled nutrient marketing would have you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing all good farmers know is that
their soil is their most important asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without good soil, you'll be constantly
battling nutrient deficiencies and disease
[SPEAKER_00]: problems as the plant won't be healthy
enough to fight off insects, fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, and other pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason we can't be more
sustainable with our growing methods and
[SPEAKER_00]: save money in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the foundation of our growing
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really quite simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start with a good base media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means investing in your soil mix
because you'll be using it for years to
[SPEAKER_00]: come.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a good soil mix that's chock full of
nutrients and good beneficial biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant is going to get off to a much
better start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's as simple as adding a
mycorrhizal inoculant when planting your
[SPEAKER_00]: rooted clone and then just using water or
a light nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of the nutrients will be in
the soil since we're using a premium mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're done vegging your plant,
you can move the plants into your flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room and preferably you would have raised
beds in your flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many advantage to this that it
makes it well worth the setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, they give plants roots access to more
soil and also more space to spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: By doing this, root space is no longer a
limiting factor for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever grown two plants side by
side with one in a container and one in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have mulberry trees in our nursery right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been in containers for three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about three to four feet in height
and the one I planted in the ground at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time we got the other ones in is now
over 10 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, they make a lot of sense if we plan
on reusing the soil because watering
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a future podcast on Blue Maths with
the North American distributor so I won't
[SPEAKER_00]: spend too much time on it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can literally hook up a soaker
hose or drippers around the beds that will
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain the moisture content in the soil
perfectly without any human intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does this save a ton of money on
labor but it also reduces the total amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of water using and eliminates those wet
dry cycles in the soil that slow down
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't emphasize enough how important
proper watering is and it's so much easier
[SPEAKER_00]: in a large container or bed to water
properly than it is in a small container
[SPEAKER_00]: especially as the plant starts to become
root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then three, when you're done growing
you can literally just pull out the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: roots and shake off any soil back into the
beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after harvesting your plant you'll
mix back in about half of one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: regular nutrient pats per yard of soil
along with a cubic foot of compost and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're up and running again 24 hours later
with your next flowering crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now every other cycle you'll probably want
to add in a little bit of aeration in the
[SPEAKER_00]: form of pumice or perlite or lava rock but
it's really that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact some of our growers don't even
pull the roots but just cut the base of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and transplant next to it
letting the roots break down in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other considerations to this growing type
are that you don't need to pH any of your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient teas or solutions or pH your
water provided that it's not at a crazy pH
[SPEAKER_00]: to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good organic soil has amazing buffering
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can remove the chlorine but we've even
run test grows with straight city tap
[SPEAKER_00]: water and the plants perform great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here is really to simplify the
entire gardening process.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for other nutrients you can use well we
typically like to make our own nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: teas out of things like seaweed extract
powder, unsulfured blackstrap molasses,
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp meal, humic acids, fish hydrolysate
or wild crafted plant teas using things
[SPEAKER_00]: like comfrey or horsetail or nettles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition you can make aerated compost
teas to increase biological diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass in your soil and we will cover
these topics in further depth throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast series and have experts
talking on these subjects so I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to spend a lot of time on it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can even use your current bottled
nutrient program provided it's organic as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as you go with very light doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see you don't want to put any of too
much nutrient into the soil because that
[SPEAKER_00]: can create excesses or deficiencies over
time and a simple soil test will allow us
[SPEAKER_00]: to view these and make the proper
recommendations or changes to our soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain it at optimal levels year after
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it's not my preferred method of
growing we are seeing some chem growers
[SPEAKER_00]: using our soil and getting better growth
and yield but they are then throwing out
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil and starting over every cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check out Green Rush on Instagram
if you want to see what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some phenomenally great looking
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see what autoflowers look
like in this type of method with the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: you can check out Alaska autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a really good Instagram feed as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you turn to the giant pumpkin
community which is the other set of
[SPEAKER_00]: fanatic growers that like to push the
envelope in regards to yield you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were growing with just chemical
nutrients up until I'd say the early 2000s
[SPEAKER_00]: and the world records were topping out
around 1,000 to 1,200 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they started incorporating back in
some organic methods and products like
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi and compost teas and
that in conjunction with ever improving
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics they have gotten the world record
over 2,600 pounds right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing, they can go from seed to
giant pumpkin in a matter of months and
[SPEAKER_00]: get that kind of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can literally see the pumpkin grow on
a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact my favorite mycorrhizal inoculant
right now comes out of the giant pumpkin
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by a formal world record holder it's
called Wow Pumpkin Pro and it's sold by
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron Wallace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the right species for most vegetables
but also fruit trees and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a great blog post on mycorrhizal
fungus if you want to learn more as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as our very first podcast interview is
with Jeff Lowenthal who wrote an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: book on the subject recently called
Teaming with Fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the outline of what the podcast
is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some amazing guests lined up so
far on a wide variety of topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked hard to source the very best
information on these subjects and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that it was all science-based and
available to growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though if you know of anyone that you
think I should interview please have them
[SPEAKER_00]: contact me through the website and if you
like the podcast please take the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave me a review on iTunes or whatever
platform you're listening on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's these reviews and comments that will
help not only inspire spreading this
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge but also allowing me to offer
these podcasts free of charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again this is the cannabis
cultivation and science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for future podcasts from
leading experts around the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't forget to check out our blog at www
