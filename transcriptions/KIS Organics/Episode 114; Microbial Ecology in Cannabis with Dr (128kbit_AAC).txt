[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation in
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest this week is Colin Bell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colin is most well known in the industry
as the co-inventor of mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_01]: He completed his PhD in soil microbial
ecology in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a research scientist at Colorado State
University, Colin published dozens of
[SPEAKER_01]: peer-reviewed publications that were
focused on elucidating microbial mediated
[SPEAKER_01]: processes that enhance plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colin's academic research includes
long-term multidisciplinary studies in
[SPEAKER_01]: which biological, chemical, and physical
characteristics of soils were measured to
[SPEAKER_01]: elucidate soil microbial and plant
responses to climate variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: He currently works for microbial mass,
a plant amendment product comprised of
[SPEAKER_01]: several unique species of beneficial
bacteria shown to promote plant vigor,
[SPEAKER_01]: increase plant biomass, and enhance
microbial life in and around the root
[SPEAKER_01]: zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Colin, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tad, great to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been quite a while and happy to be
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm glad we got to reconnect and I
wanted to just start off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you tell us what's been going on
with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit about yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so for those of you that don't know
me, my name is Colin Bell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually a scientist in my background
training.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a PhD in soil microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I studied at Texas Tech University from
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved over to Fort Collins, Colorado
where I worked at the Natural Resource
[SPEAKER_02]: Ecology Center at Colorado State
University and I worked for years and all
[SPEAKER_02]: my academic and research background is
focused on understanding the importance of
[SPEAKER_02]: plant microbe interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did a lot of studies, published a lot of
papers in both natural and agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: systems and just basically got a really
sound fundamental understanding of how
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes work with plants to support plant
growth in these different environments
[SPEAKER_02]: including precision agriculture systems
and indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, you also were the founder or
creator of Mammoth Pea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to mention that, that's pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're currently working over at
Microbial Mass, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I was the co-founder of
Mammoth Microbes, the inventor of that
[SPEAKER_02]: technology and a lot of people probably
know me because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been a really amazing journey and I
learned a lot doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, and it was at the very end of
last year, in October last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: I made the choice to lead the organization
for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, it kind of got to the size where I
thought it was going a different direction
[SPEAKER_02]: that I didn't necessarily want to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't in the vision, but when you
get to a larger size organization and
[SPEAKER_02]: bring people in and outsiders and
investors, you start to lose control and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe swerve away from the original vision
and intention you had for the
[SPEAKER_02]: organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to follow my path and I left.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took some time off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done some fun stuff and you and I
were talking about some of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, I'm trying to follow my
passion and trying to really enjoy my
[SPEAKER_02]: professional career to the fullest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I enjoy that by working with people
that I really enjoy working with,
[SPEAKER_02]: that are go-getters and that I can trust
and have a lot of fun with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And along with that, I have to work with
companies that I believe in and not only
[SPEAKER_02]: from a mission and vision, but from a
technology and innovation point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has to kind of fit my expertise,
which is microbial and natural
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very passionate about agriculture
innovation and figuring out how to
[SPEAKER_02]: formulate and how to develop nature and
nature solutions to fit into conventional
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture management practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the MASS, microbial MASS technologies,
MIMHorticulture is the name of the company
[SPEAKER_02]: out of Canada, has done some very
interesting things that intrigued me,
[SPEAKER_02]: not only from a team perspective,
but from a technology perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm really happy to be helping them
develop their business in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was kind of blindsided because you
and I had talked and I was just asking you
[SPEAKER_01]: what you were up to and you weren't doing
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next thing I knew, I hear from
another friend that you're working over at
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial MASS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to call up my buddy, David
Bernard Perrone, and he was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: filling me in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Francois, who actually was the
one who developed microbial MASS,
[SPEAKER_01]: is another friend of mine who I haven't
talked to in a little while, but he's an
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome researcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm excited to see you guys working
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, before we dive into like the
real meat of the podcast, tell me just a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about microbial MASS and what
you find interesting about it as a
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial, you know, biostimulant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just mention that, you know,
David and Francois are two of the reasons
[SPEAKER_02]: when I speak of team and people that I
really want to work with and have fun
[SPEAKER_02]: working with was part of the decision
making for me joining this group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great guys, a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you know them both very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I really geeked out as a
microbiologist and someone that really
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to apply microbiology in the market
with technology and microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the approach that I took with Mammoth
P was a quite different approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: This group took quite a different
approach, which intrigued me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was something I've been trying to
do or wanting to do with the Grossentia
[SPEAKER_02]: group when I was, you know, an operational
founder and, you know, a member of that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw this group being able to execute
that well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the differences, I think, are
precision, to be fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some certain functionality that
we nurtured in Mammoth P. Tardony foster
[SPEAKER_02]: cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a lot of unknowns that were
occurring in that particular formula as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a microbial ecologist, soil
ecologist, I embraced those unknowns
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing that there's not everything we're
ever going to learn about plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial function.
[SPEAKER_02]: But believing that a lot of those things
could enhance plant success and there
[SPEAKER_02]: could be a lot of functional redundancies
that could help help plants grow
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully across the growing season
without us necessarily understanding what
[SPEAKER_02]: they all are.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I felt like the Mammoth Horticulture
group did really well was work with
[SPEAKER_02]: super-defined carriers, super-defined
formula, and really honing in on the
[SPEAKER_02]: functionality of the microbes they were
using to not only present a very specific
[SPEAKER_02]: microbe with a very specific function,
for the industry, but it eliminates a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of the unknowns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made me think of something that was
pretty common in the industry now,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least from the salt and the hydro
growers, was this aspect of clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the clean speak around
growing plants now and keeping it as clean
[SPEAKER_02]: and sterile as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not necessarily something I
completely agree with, but I understand
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the paradigm and a lot of people want
to start focusing on that aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt like if there was a way that we
could incorporate microbes into a clean,
[SPEAKER_02]: grow environment, it would help the
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had to figure out how to do that
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like this group has done that
with this particular formula.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first clean microbial solution
where everything's very well defined and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're using dormant bacteria to deliver
to the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it works through the irrigation,
the irrigation system completely,
[SPEAKER_02]: virtually sterile because of the dormancy
of the microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the microbes actually activate when
they get the plant roots to stimulate
[SPEAKER_02]: plant growth across the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mass product in particular has done a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a couple of microbes that
they've quantified really well in the
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory and in grow environments to
increase the mass of early stage rooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then three of the other microbes in
this particular product are focused on
[SPEAKER_02]: later stage phosphorecycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a really interesting one,
two punch, maximizing the plant's ability
[SPEAKER_02]: to establish early on and then to uptake
nutrients later on in the growth cycle to
[SPEAKER_02]: maximize their ability to stack and yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have the same issues with
biofilm buildup, I would assume,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're looking at dormant bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this product was developed,
I believe, or discovered out of David's
[SPEAKER_01]: grow when he was at Whistler Medical on
the cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the product was actually derived,
and correct me if I'm wrong here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but from that sort of relationship
co-evolution of these particular bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: How I understand it, the product wasn't
developed, but the microbes were
[SPEAKER_02]: identified in that environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were identified and they were
selected and then scaled up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the product formulation,
the product development formulation
[SPEAKER_02]: process took over where they utilize the
microbes from the cannabis grow to create
[SPEAKER_02]: a formula, a clean formula to carry them
in and make it very compatible,
[SPEAKER_02]: not only for living soil growers,
but also for clean, salt, hydroponic
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you bring up an important
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big difference between clean and
sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have microbial interactions going
on in your soil and not be sterile,
[SPEAKER_01]: but still have a clean room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not throwing out all the IPM
processes around keeping your area clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to highlight that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm kind of going off topic here
a little bit, but you and I just both
[SPEAKER_01]: attended a webinar by Dr. Poonja talking
about hoplatin viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that he pointed out
around it was that it damages root mass in
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a lot of interesting points around
it in terms of most plants being
[SPEAKER_01]: asymptomatic and just the prevalence of
this viroid in the plants that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: currently cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wonder if we could have a reduction
in symptoms if we can get some microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: products that potentially could increase
root mass to offset some of the damage
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're seeing from a viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think conceptually that's exactly
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we heard in that particular
presentation, which was very well done,
[SPEAKER_02]: was that in a lot of cases, it silences
genes in the plants, among a host of other
[SPEAKER_02]: things that the viroid does to the plant
to help deter its maximum success.
[SPEAKER_02]: It diminishes root growth, diminishes
trichome production, diminishes overall
[SPEAKER_02]: yield, diminishes stem stability,
but the gene silencing, which I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: was pretty interesting also, because
that's going to silence a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance genes in these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the idea is maximizing the plant
health to its full potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a strong argument that if you
have the beneficial microbes occupying
[SPEAKER_02]: their rhizosphere and root zone,
it's going to maximize the plant's ability
[SPEAKER_02]: to fend off particular pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other piece of that was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: The viroid, hoplatin viroid, actually
makes plants more susceptible to bacterial
[SPEAKER_02]: infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can almost offset that with
beneficials because there's a probability
[SPEAKER_02]: gain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life has a probability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can occupy space with
beneficials, it's going to be harder for
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens to come in and affect your
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, getting back to the outline that I
had for this conversation today,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things that I thought would be
really useful to ask you is how do we grow
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that you've had a lot of
experience on, especially when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: developing a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the home cultivator or a
commercial grower, they don't have a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably getting things off the
shelf as food sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying to use microbes like maybe
lactobacillus or maybe extend a microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: product they already have, how would
someone begin to start, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this process?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend it for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to teach at the university when
I was a student.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would teach labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would culture microbes from the
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a really fun way to start if
you're thinking about growing microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had people take a sterile swab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take a sterile Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the growing microbes I'm going to
start is not as complicated as keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: them pristine, meaning growing the
microbes you want to grow and preventing
[SPEAKER_02]: from contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used the word sterile a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that comes up
sometimes in cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, it's a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no chance that sterility exists in
the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a probability.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sterility just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be able to happen for a short
period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different food sources
that you can make or you can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: commercially buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're pretty cheap to grow microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just like you and I, microbes,
are heterotrophs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They eat food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they respire carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they take in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can just create any kind of
food source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will grow microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing about growing
microbes is some favor some food sources
[SPEAKER_02]: over the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of different media
you can use to maximize the success of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing certain strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Bibles of microbiology,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a methods of microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have thousands of different
microbial medias.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have the actual formulas for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a really interesting book you
can reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can probably buy online.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely pick up at a library or
a university library for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just look at all these different
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's typically sugar sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's typically protein sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there can be a liquid solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it can be in a solidified solution
where you have an agar gel from
[SPEAKER_02]: polysaccharide to help solidify that and
streak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes or streak something that you've
collected from the environment on a plate
[SPEAKER_02]: or just put it in a broth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And microbes will grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually leave these plates out
just exposed for minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can grow microbes from the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see growth in less than a week
easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very simple to grow microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding the microbes that you want
to grow and how to optimize that growth
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes a lot more sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with all kind of microbial production,
the growing of microbes is typically not
[SPEAKER_02]: the crux.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the maintaining the purity of that
microbial culture is what becomes very
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the aseptic transferring technique,
which is your sterile technique of
[SPEAKER_02]: transferring from one place to another,
your microbe becomes most of the risk when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're growing microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's really hard to have a
consistent microbial formula over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I imagine most people if they tested
their lactobacillus or any of their
[SPEAKER_02]: concoctions that we make, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And including microbial teams,
I think we'll find very different
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial assemblages in those over time
from batch to batch easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's from the water source.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different sources that can
affect that microbial community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the structure of that over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came into this industry through the
aerated compost tea world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're saying really holds true
for my experience too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was that every batch is going to
be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not identifying these particular
strains or species.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by having sufficient levels of oxygen
and selecting an aerobic environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: and using a source of material,
in this case, compost that we know to be
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly free of pathogens, we're hopefully
tilting the scales in the direction of
[SPEAKER_01]: more beneficial microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at the very least, when I talk about
compost tea, people make claims that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think are just crazy around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, the idea of disease suppression
and some of these other things may occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you said, every batch is going to
be, or like I said, I guess every batch is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't get replication consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be really hard to make any
conclusions or even determine any trends
[SPEAKER_01]: over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I think is interesting about is,
can we get nutrients functional,
[SPEAKER_01]: like nutrient cycling, like in a tea,
that we can apply to the soil that would
[SPEAKER_01]: allow us to increase that microbial loop,
that nutrient cycling going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: on some level through this shotgun
approach?
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the answer is absolutely
positive, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because of the way microbes work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I would say is a really practical
goal for a tea, or having just a mixed
[SPEAKER_02]: consortia of microbes, is having a
critical mass, a number, a count,
[SPEAKER_02]: a threshold, biomass, that gets to a
certain level where it can function at a
[SPEAKER_02]: very high level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't necessarily matter who's in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In every case, if you're trying to get a
general nutrient cycling function out of a
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial group, you want to make sure
there are no pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can make the assumption that
there's enough functional redundancy that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have microbes that under
different conditions are going to step up
[SPEAKER_02]: and perform the function that maybe
another microbial group that performs the
[SPEAKER_02]: same function can't under a certain
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see that a lot in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see it any different than in
natural systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to do a lot of work in desert
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used to talk a lot about functional
redundancy because the environment was so
[SPEAKER_02]: extreme that you'd find different
microbial groups that you could test them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would do the same thing
functionally, but they would have very
[SPEAKER_02]: different environmental thresholds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some would work much better in drier
conditions or in warmer conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some would work better in colder
conditions or under pH stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having the functional redundancy,
I think, is a plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the real value in those cases is
making sure you have a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration so you can maximize the
functionality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's going to be this asymptote,
if you want me to draw a line here with my
[SPEAKER_02]: hand, where the lower the concentration,
you're going to get lower functionality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then at some point, it's just going to
reach this critical threshold where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: maximizing your functionality as a
function of the biomass or the
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration of microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And reaching that without any potential
pathogens would be, I think, the target
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're trying to go for in a tea or
any kind of microbial concoction that's
[SPEAKER_02]: generally defined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you say functional redundancy,
essentially what you're saying is,
[SPEAKER_01]: just to reiterate, in a desert system,
for example, let's say a cactus needs
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a particular strain of
bacteria that's very good at cycling
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus when it is very cold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it heats up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bacteria is potentially going to go
dormant, die off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the plant still needs phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, another microbe that maybe doesn't
function at cold temperatures but
[SPEAKER_01]: functions quite well at hot temperatures,
say over 100 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to reproduce and cycle nutrients
and provide phosphorus for that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: under those conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they essentially can occupy the
same ecological niche for the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is phosphorus cycling, yet coexist
and not really compete with each other
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're functioning at different
variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, it could be pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that kind of encapsulate that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly how it works in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly how it would work in
farming or in precision agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: pH is the example that I think is the most
prevalent environmental factor affecting
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial success.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a salt concentration with
nutrients and all the conventional
[SPEAKER_02]: management practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pH is a big part of that also.
[SPEAKER_02]: pH actually is shown to predicate
microbial diversity and community
[SPEAKER_02]: composition more than any other factor
being the strongest factor to manipulate
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial community structure across the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you look at different conditions,
the different soil types, whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: out of all the factors there might be,
temperature, water, pH, others,
[SPEAKER_02]: pH is the first determining factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's interesting for indoor
growing because you can have pH shifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You try to avoid that, but that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with functional redundancy,
you have microbes that are able to persist
[SPEAKER_02]: and function through those shifts and kind
of overall bridge a functional gap where a
[SPEAKER_02]: single microbe might work really well at a
certain pH, let's say seven, but it might
[SPEAKER_02]: be very stressed at a pH of five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that would not be the best microbe
in that particular environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having another backup microbe that
worked well across the range of that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular environmental threshold pH
would serve the plant better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important for people to keep
in mind that we tend to think in like
[SPEAKER_01]: black and white, but the reality of this,
the complexity of the rhizosphere is that
[SPEAKER_01]: like the soil may have a pH that we're
getting, but like within that soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all these little micro pockets
where the pH might be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different, where hydrology might be a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where these little ecological
niches occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard for me to wrap my brain
around because it's so small and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this idea that the microbes in your
soil are always changing, I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really important because when we
start getting into these like general
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts of like fungal to bacteria ratio
or overall biomass, if my soil is always
[SPEAKER_01]: changing, how can we use those metrics to
really make informed decisions just due to
[SPEAKER_01]: the variability and fluctuation of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to add to that that,
you know, in soils, if you compare the
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of substrates,
let's say that plants might grow in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in agriculture, indoor agriculture,
it would go from soil all the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: soilless media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on the far extreme, let's just say
rock wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's different buffering
capacities across those substrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: That varies substantially.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about the rock wall scenario
as the most extreme other example from
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, those environments are going to
change dramatically with every watering
[SPEAKER_02]: event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as the ions coming through and it
kind of drains through, it doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you really want to be diligent on
pHing the solution before you water your
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, because you can stress that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But microbes work really well in those
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the whole other extreme, I think about
soil where it's more buffered and in the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you think about microbiology and scale
is a really interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes are just micrometers,
you know, which is such a small,
[SPEAKER_02]: just such a small size that obviously it's
microscopic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't see with the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you saw it along the tiniest root
here, it would just be a speck even from a
[SPEAKER_02]: magnification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the environments that get created
along with the root zone or the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere are highly buffered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that you're going to have
an ebb and flow of different populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also, I think about it as a
probability game, where if there's
[SPEAKER_02]: successful microbes in that environment,
they're going to swell and shrink
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on certain circumstances as far
as their overall population or growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're probably going to remain
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they might not completely turn over to
a completely different group.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have some additions coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that the turnover is as
extreme as much as the ebbing and swelling
[SPEAKER_02]: would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a probability game.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing that further
complicates it is the life cycles of these
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes, the generations of them are so
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just within a given flowering cycle,
we have coevolution happening on a
[SPEAKER_01]: microscopic scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I've mentioned this in
previous podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I talked to my good friend Nate Gibbs
over at Goldleaf Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've had their soil in their beds
for over eight years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's his intellectual property at
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what gives him something different
than everyone else on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the microbes in that soil,
we'll call it microbes, but the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: levels, the microbes, the pH, all of those
things are unique to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer the soil that he got from
me eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's his own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think the visual I would use
to frame how microbes exist in any
[SPEAKER_02]: environment in the rice experience soil is
how I talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as a community starts off,
it's just a very low concentration or a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain single microbe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they call that the lag phase of the
microbial growth curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point, there's typically a lot
of food resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, that microbial group or that
mass will get to a certain concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they grow really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they reproduce or clone out very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They split.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually just clone out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in days, they can really change their
mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they'll grow into an exponential
growth phase where they'll just grow at a
[SPEAKER_02]: 10x rate in a very quick, in that
environment, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point, they'll level off where
the food source equals the live death.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the food source is sustaining that
certain concentration of microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that that just that longer growth
phase, it's a life equals death.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called stationary where microbes are
turning over, but they're reproducing at
[SPEAKER_02]: about the same rate they're dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're maintaining this certain
mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only when a food source or some
environmental conditions really disrupt
[SPEAKER_02]: that particular mass, you get this death
phase going down where the concentration
[SPEAKER_02]: starts to decline rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that that stationary growth phase
can can persist for a very long period of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just indicative of the microbe
being very happy in that environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: having enough of a food source and a long
enough life cycle to persist and have a
[SPEAKER_02]: have a pretty predictable turnover,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you say food sources,
that could be a variety of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: could be exudates coming directly from the
plant itself out of the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a variety of organic matter
things or fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that, for example, it could be a
little bit of alfalfa meal, a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of feather or fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about mineral salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they affect microbes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people think that mineral
salts actually kill microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm here to tell you, that's not
necessarily the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depended on time and concentration
for even disinfected solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried to kill microbes before a
robust microbial formulas, and I've had a
[SPEAKER_02]: very hard time doing it, even with
commercially available products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydrogen peroxide, chlorine, solutions,
and it comes down to the concentration of
[SPEAKER_02]: the solution and the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time, those are the two factors
that you have to dial in in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully kill microbes in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in practice, I've never seen microbes
really die off through us through just a
[SPEAKER_02]: propagation practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually had a hard time,
again, killing microbes through just
[SPEAKER_02]: recommended practices of most
disinfectants that are recommended in our
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, cleaning lines and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be a longer time and a high
concentration to significantly disrupt
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea behind salts killing microbes
is that they raise the soluble salt level
[SPEAKER_01]: in either the media or in the nutrient
solution, so the EC of that, to a level to
[SPEAKER_01]: where the microbes through osmotic shock
die, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's been this idea perpetuated
industry that mineral salts kill microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yet there's research out there that
I've seen that shows that mineral salts in
[SPEAKER_01]: low doses actually feed microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a source for a food source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes consume the same nutrients that
plants do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only other nutrient that they get
but not from the substrate is carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is a pretty interesting
evolutionary tool of plants to feed
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthate priming into the soil or to
the substrate to feed microbes the sugars
[SPEAKER_02]: that they take from the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: They consume some of the carbon to create
their biomass, but they also shoot a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of that sugar into the soil to feed
microbes the carbon they need,
[SPEAKER_02]: so the microbes can actively help cycle
nutrients to support their success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to say this all the time,
but microbes, all plants in nature,
[SPEAKER_02]: the natural ones exist because of that
microbial relationship they have in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, because the microbes actually help
them take up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're feeding soluble nutrients
into a solution and microbes are there,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're absolutely going to take you
advantage of those just like the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: would.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wouldn't call it a competition,
but there is a little bit of cohabitation
[SPEAKER_02]: of utilizing the resources in that
particular environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's just an important
point that I wanted you to make or to hear
[SPEAKER_01]: you say, because what we see from when we
look at competition vegetable growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: like giant pumpkin growers, tomatoes,
things like that, they're doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of organic inputs,
microbial stimulants, like mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus, for example, and then levels of
mineral salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we see the largest
yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think ultimately, if we want to talk
about just growing the largest plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be this hybrid method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm an organic guy and I could
absolutely make the argument for why I
[SPEAKER_01]: choose not to use mineral salts,
but I also want to be pragmatic about it
[SPEAKER_01]: and acknowledge that if we're just talking
about yield or plant growth, this hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: method, I think, is really the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, positively.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what I've seen also for a
couple of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that having that extra catalyst,
if you were going to call microbes a
[SPEAKER_02]: catalyst, and they do not only act as a
catalyst, but they create other
[SPEAKER_02]: biomolecules that act as catalysts to help
cycle nutrients, to help stimulate the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to want to take up more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the rhizosphere with beneficial
bacteria protect plants from infection,
[SPEAKER_02]: from other pathogens that might come in
just from ecological niche theory by
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: These microbes can create different
chemical signaling analogous to hormones
[SPEAKER_02]: in some cases that will stimulate plant
growth, which is a very interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They obviously cycle nutrients,
which can become sticky and not available
[SPEAKER_02]: to the plants, especially in soil
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great example of that,
where they can actually solubilize that
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus and make it available for the
plant to uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things these microbes do
to help plants across the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess one more example is, and this
isn't as much in soils as it would happen
[SPEAKER_02]: in probably cocoa and ruffle in some
cases, and there's a lockout event that
[SPEAKER_02]: occurs in some cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a flooding of ions,
the plants are unable to balance that out
[SPEAKER_02]: very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes do a really good job of balancing
out plant nutrient uptake along the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere and root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes can actually alleviate the
potential for lockout events.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a really fascinating thing
that a lot of growers probably experience,
[SPEAKER_02]: just without understanding it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have these really micro lockout
events through just feeding salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants won't show for days,
and the plants can probably work out of
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but it's a staggering growth event
that with microbes, the plants wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: feel that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could focus all their energies into
the upward growth of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of the plant being almost stunted,
although you couldn't measure that
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily just by watching the plant
grow, as it's being fed pure salts across
[SPEAKER_02]: the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had growers that have used microbes
that they were just feeding ruffles,
[SPEAKER_02]: an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Salt, and they would add a microbial
solution, and in two days they would just
[SPEAKER_02]: see their plants open up and literally
they would call it explode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, their buds just started
really growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a while to think through this,
but I think the truth is that there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lockout that's occurring that microbes can
quickly get rid of and allow the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: just to focus on uptaking nutrients and
allocating them without any kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: stutter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your theory or hypothesis around this is
that even in a relatively sterile system,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we say sterile, but there's no grow
that's actually sterile, but in a system
[SPEAKER_01]: with less microbes that's not using soil,
using a media like rockwool and mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: salts, there's still room for clean
microbial products that could potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: increase yield or have other plant
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I fully understand the
mechanism of action there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking, okay, these microbes maybe
could help potentially cycle nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they surviving or persisting in the
rockwool or are they converting nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: into a form that addresses some other
plant need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they occupying niches on the plant
roots themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's really going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we know completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's kind of interesting about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that in rockwool, in a
rockwool environment, since you brought
[SPEAKER_02]: that up, the rhizosphere and roots create
a very habitable environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sticky, nice carbon foundation,
and it's exuding carbon into that
[SPEAKER_02]: rockwool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are just doing that,
so the microbes can live on the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be very happy, quite honestly,
no matter what the substrate is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find that even in soil,
the microbial concentration gets greater
[SPEAKER_02]: the closer to the roots or on the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hot spot that the microbes like
to be in.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of microbial science is still a
little bit nascent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to measure all of the
idiosyncrasies and interactions that
[SPEAKER_02]: occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think part of that turnover that you
referenced earlier where the microbes are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to die, they are going to lyse,
the cells break open, and the constituents
[SPEAKER_02]: of those cells create a bio-food source
that stimulates the plants, and the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: are able to take that up also.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of simple proteins that the
plants can take up that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, what I've seen is I think the
plants just get more nourished,
[SPEAKER_02]: or they are able to get more resources
with that extra catalyst, somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we understand nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some other mechanisms biological
mechanisms that are obviously occurring in
[SPEAKER_02]: a more synthetic environment and a more of
a rockwool substrate where the nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: are being fed and we think that they're
all soluble, so the plants seem to be
[SPEAKER_02]: taking them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think plants, in some cases,
are able to take up more nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so they're able to allocate more.
[SPEAKER_02]: One last detail that I think is
fascinating, I've seen just numerous times
[SPEAKER_02]: in say a rockwool room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have a synthetic fertilizer and a
synthetic fertilizer treatment with
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants both look good, but they're
actually not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed in many cases the smell,
the terpene profile, and even resin
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles anecdotally and quantifiably are
much higher in a lot of the microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment than just a plain synthetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even tell by the smell and going
through, and I've smelled plants that look
[SPEAKER_02]: similar, but one smelled like hay or cut
grass, and one smelled more like a really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting cannabis strain, and it was
sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only difference was microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the microbes are not only
able to deliver more resources to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, but they might also trigger some
type of signaling that allows the plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: turn on some of these genes that produce
more cannabinoids, maybe produce more
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, produce more resins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know now that some of these microbes
are actually going into the root tip
[SPEAKER_01]: itself, into the plant, and then back out
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty incredible, the stuff we're
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've been thinking about lately,
because we were talking about how do we
[SPEAKER_01]: apply microbes, or how do we look at soils
and diversity?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a complete thought,
so bear with me on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first part of this that I want to
share that goes into this thought process
[SPEAKER_01]: is when I make compost tea, I'm going for
nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I look at it on the microscope,
if I brew for let's say more than 60
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, at the end of the day, I don't have
that level of diversity anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much what I'm down to is just one
morphology of bacteria and one morphology
[SPEAKER_01]: of typically of some sort of flagellate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give the analogy, what if I just took a
zoo and put out all this food and opened
[SPEAKER_01]: up all the gates?
[SPEAKER_01]: At first there'd be this explosion of
growth, and then you'd come back a week
[SPEAKER_01]: later and you'd just have your lions and
your rats, your apex predator and your
[SPEAKER_01]: best survivalist, and they'll fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria will explode, and then all of
a sudden I'll come back eight hours later
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll just be all flagellates because
they will have eaten all the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they no longer have food,
so they die off, and then the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: explodes again, and you get this roller
coaster, but you've lost all your
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think about no-till, you can see
where I'm going here, and this idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: my good friend Ben Higgins explained to me
talking about the disturbance hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is this idea that when we have new
land that has let's just say a volcano
[SPEAKER_01]: lava forming this land, there's no life on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll slowly start to see species get
introduced, but the diversity on that rock
[SPEAKER_01]: is minimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, over time that diversity increases,
and we'll start to see grasslands,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then forests, and soil will obviously
develop, and then eventually we'll end up
[SPEAKER_01]: in what is known as a climax ecological
niche, something like old growth forest,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the diversity declines at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere in the middle there is where we
have our maximum level of diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not at the end in the old growth
forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not at the beginning where we just
have bare rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somewhere in the middle, and so this
is one of the reasons in my brain I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, maybe a little bit of soil
disturbance is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's good, so when we go to re-amend
our living soil beds, we're not breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: out a mechanical tiller and just
destroying all soil structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we are mixing in nutrients for the
next cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that really as harmful as people might
make it out to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've already kind of shared my
opinion through my explanation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what are your thoughts around it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I'm kind of here in a
succession theory, which is a really fun
[SPEAKER_02]: idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to do it in my ecology class.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had soil fungi for years,
and as a desert ecologist, fungi really
[SPEAKER_02]: dominate the function of those soils
because of their, not only the morphology,
[SPEAKER_02]: but their physiology, and they're able to
withstand, and you can see that at a
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see this on this forest scale that
you're talking about, and this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: peak of diversity before it starts to
dwindle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always thought of agriculture as an
inherently disturbed system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's any kind of stasis
or secession.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where this natural environment slowly,
the biology in that slowly evolves in
[SPEAKER_02]: secession, so you have this just climax
type of community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be that way,
and so I think that in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's whatever you're trying to
accomplish is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that fungi get more disturbed
than bacteria just because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: structure that they form, and so if you
have just really intricate, involved,
[SPEAKER_02]: established fungal mats, and you break
that apart, that's going to disturb the
[SPEAKER_02]: functionality of those fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not necessarily the case in our
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacteria are a lot more forgiving through
disturbance because their size allows them
[SPEAKER_02]: not to feel the disturbance like larger
organisms might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think about farmlands where the
tilling versus no tilling has been argued,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think that there's a practical
balance where you'll see a lot of farms
[SPEAKER_02]: where they have strips of grass in between
every other row, and that's the nurture of
[SPEAKER_02]: the mycorrhizae and the fungi in the soil
where there's at least a presence of
[SPEAKER_02]: undisturbed fungi that can help influence
the plant growth every year as they're
[SPEAKER_02]: planting out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's a really hard target to
think you're not going to disturb soils or
[SPEAKER_02]: work with disturbed soils in any type of
agriculture, and I think it's important to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand if you're using biology to
understand how resilient that biology is
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're working with in that
particular environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not all microbes would do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're collecting, to go back to your
example, if you're working with tea,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're taking samples from nature,
well, those natural samples, a lot of that
[SPEAKER_02]: biology hasn't evolved to love that tea
environment, and so the environment
[SPEAKER_02]: selects in biology, it's almost like
basically a law.
[SPEAKER_02]: The environment selects, and so you
created a different environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: and now the biology is working through
that environment, and you talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: having the morphology of rods,
but I'd argue also that there's probably a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of diversity because it's one
morphological group.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different species and
genus that represent bacillus rod shaped.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could be gram positive, they could be
gram negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you did those gram
staining, so there could be a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity, but you wiped out the microbes
that couldn't persist in that environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so now you're just forced to work with
the microbes that will work for you in
[SPEAKER_02]: your tea environment that will work for
your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just qualitatively under the
microscope, you see a massive drop in
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity over time, which just got me
thinking about the whole disturbance
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, but one of the things that
agronomist Lee Brees, I had him on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, he turned to me and he goes,
Tad, agriculture is not a natural system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not natural, and I have to remind
myself of that because people always say,
[SPEAKER_01]: go back to nature, do what nature does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nature doesn't do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't select for one species,
or one variety plant over at the exclusion
[SPEAKER_01]: of all else, and so the amount of
diversity in a forest versus what we see
[SPEAKER_01]: on a microbial level in agricultural lands
is quite drastically different,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think we have to remember too,
in an agricultural system, every time we
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest a plant, we're removing biomass,
we're removing organic matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're removing nutrients, and those have
to be replaced, and if we can manage that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that replacement to keep us at a level of
stasis that's optimal for cycle after
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, that's really what we're going for
with soil testing and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find it all really interesting and
fascinating, but I don't get as worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about disturbance and some more recent
things that have got me thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: this, and again, I'm talking about indoor
beds or pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about tilling outdoor
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of reasons not to
till for erosion and other disturbance
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, but if we're talking about indoor
beds, hand tilling or hand disturbing,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know now that heavy metals tend to
accumulate in the roots and the stems of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants more than buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's research to support that,
so if we can remove those things,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're lowering the amount of heavy metals
in our bed, which is a good thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in states where you're
regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the presentation and the research by
Dr. Poonja, we know that this viroid is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be more accumulative in the roots
of the plant, so if we take those roots
[SPEAKER_01]: out, we'll be removing some of that viroid
load.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, and maybe someone will
convince me of something differently,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm inclined to remove as much of that as
we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's all very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think we'll ever fully understand
all of this because it is so complex?
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I don't think we'll ever fully
understand even the human body,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it has orders of magnitude more
research funding thrown at it than
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiology, to be fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll continue to learn more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 20 years from now, we're going to
look back and we're going to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, we didn't understand that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've learned more about viruses and
viroids than we ever have before,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we know about this much about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The techniques and methods and the way
they just function, although coronavirus
[SPEAKER_02]: has helped with that, with the research
and funding to understand that,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like a drop in the ocean on what I
think we know about these smaller life
[SPEAKER_02]: forms for a couple of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still pretty nascent, although it's
amazing what we've learned over the last,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the first time I went to a soil
ecology conference, and they decided to
[SPEAKER_02]: open up the black box of soil,
and agriculture just considered soil a
[SPEAKER_02]: black box, just a constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it treated soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It said, we're actually going to look
inside, and we're going to start
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding the biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when microbial ecology started,
as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of work done before,
but it was very early.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have a lot of fun stuff to learn
on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about the history of
agriculture, I think one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been successful is you mentioned
that pH is one of the main variables in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of influencing microbial growth and
what microbes are successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's where I think the soil
testing really was important, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: hear people talk about, I'm an organic
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need a pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, soil has amazing buffering
capacities, but this idea that farmers for
[SPEAKER_01]: years have been targeting very specific pH
ranges, which are beneficial for plant
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake, but also beneficial for these
microbes, I think maybe we were
[SPEAKER_01]: inadvertently getting benefits that we
weren't even aware of on a microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, why I believe soil testing is so
important when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: reamending and managing a grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were kind of talking about,
I think, about confidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think consistency is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consistent inputs or consistent practices
ultimately yield consistent results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And consistency can be a predictable
range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially when we're talking about
microbiology or organic growing or living
[SPEAKER_02]: beds, it's not going to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that what we want to do
ultimately is predict the range of
[SPEAKER_02]: confidence so we know the ups and downs,
so to speak, of what to expect from
[SPEAKER_02]: functionality and just all the
constituents of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like you're talking about,
you can manage that.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you can measure it,
you can manage it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To think it's static, that's just not
realistic in life at all, especially when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're dealing with biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're saying there is what we're
targeting is a range.
[SPEAKER_01]: With soils in terms of outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a way to manage it,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just this finite number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a range of numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can control that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that it's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have to let go of a little bit of
our control in these systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I used to do a lot of natural
studies in grasslands and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to do annual studies where I
would do quarterly and seasonal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go out and take samples and look at
the rise of sphere microbes and look at
[SPEAKER_02]: how the population or the community
diversity changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it changes every season, depending on
the conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that, although the soil was
well buffered as far as pH, the plants had
[SPEAKER_02]: a large influence and then the temperature
had a large influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes, you know, the hydrology had
an influence there also where I could see
[SPEAKER_02]: a dramatic shift in microbial community
assemblage and populations or
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations across the growing season,
across 12 months or four seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it would come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my predictable range was that
annual cycle where I could pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: predict what the microbes were going to be
doing on a seasonal level based on three
[SPEAKER_02]: or four different parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take a far enough step back,
you get that consistency or you start to
[SPEAKER_01]: see some patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking at my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one question I didn't really get
to ask you that I wanted to that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: fits into what we're talking about here is
from my interview with Dr. Michael
[SPEAKER_01]: Brownbridge, one of the things he
mentioned was like, he doesn't understand
[SPEAKER_01]: why there's so many products in some of
these, you know, biostimulants or micro
[SPEAKER_01]: products on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a huge list of microbes
of what they're putting in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing that a lot of these may occupy the
same ecological niche, or compete for the
[SPEAKER_01]: same space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, knowing that these
microbes are constantly changing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do we want a more target approach
where we have one microbe or a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like mycorrhizal fungus or
trichoderma or Bavaria?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do we want a consortium of microbes in
our microbial product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do we want, I guess, do we need,
is it a waste of money to be buying ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that have all of these in there when we
could just be a little more targeted about
[SPEAKER_01]: it, I guess?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not so sure that cost is
associated with the different
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations or the different formulas
of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that in general, it kind of
just depends on the confidence you have in
[SPEAKER_02]: that product and what you think it's going
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen companies just throw everything
in the kitchen sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Add a product and just have everything in
there because that was their marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not so sure how much actual scientific
validation they had for the formula,
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than just throwing everything in
there and saying, hey, everything's in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it does provide for some
functional redundancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have more species, I am a proponent
of a consortia effect, but I would say a
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible or a well thought out
consortia effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the thought behind mammoth
microbes or mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also the thought behind the
microbial mass technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what the microbes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your promise is those microbial
concentrations and what they're doing for
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a really good approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start seeing a large assortment
of microbes, I think I really question the
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would suggest that's really hard to
manufacture.
[SPEAKER_02]: With consistency, a really large consortia
and maintain that in the bottle over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not so sure it's bad or good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that it's less defined and I
would consider them much more general
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions just to help with nutrient
cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say that more of the
functionally targeted consortias are a
[SPEAKER_02]: very interesting approach because there is
typically a lot of thought put behind not
[SPEAKER_02]: only the function of the micro,
but the redundancy of the microbe and the
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental resilience of those
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I see in the products that
have a limited consortia, there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that I think that you and I
just kind of take for granted and that I
[SPEAKER_01]: hope other people will start doing and
many people do is just set up a trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like have a control, test to see if this
product in your environment gives you an
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may be surprised by the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, for example, was surprised by the
mammoth pea results.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a gold leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not think we'd see any sort of
statistically significant difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did because I was like our soil
already has all this good microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: activity and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that surprised me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's worth revisiting to see
if we're still getting those bumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is sort of the thing is
people have to do this ongoing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just do one trial, but replicate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're setting up a trial right now
with microbial mass and gold leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to hopefully get to
document and share those results.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think people need to test it
out because I feel pretty confident saying
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's a lot of microbial products
on the market that give micro products a
[SPEAKER_01]: bad name, whether they just took a bunch
of powders out of China that were
[SPEAKER_01]: supposedly these concentrations mixed them
all together because they saw a research
[SPEAKER_01]: paper on it that said that they were
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them are quite popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I don't think people are
getting the results that they should be
[SPEAKER_01]: getting for what they're paying for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the approach I've always
taken, kind of the scientific approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like bringing validated innovation into
the market to help the success of growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the whole intention, kind of the
purpose I have professionally and as a
[SPEAKER_02]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair at the university.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really important to measure
those results and to define success and
[SPEAKER_02]: talking with the manufacturers to
understand what those expectations,
[SPEAKER_02]: what is the product intended to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can make sure you can measure
it to get those results.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it increases yield, if it's supposed to
increase yield, is there validating data
[SPEAKER_02]: that the manufacturers have conducted
studies that shown that it's increased
[SPEAKER_02]: yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can actually start to have some
confidence that you would expect that so
[SPEAKER_02]: you can measure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing for a quality metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen products that, you know,
promise quality metrics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you can measure it and you have
validating data that supports that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, let's use the product for its
intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of cases, there's not a real purpose
or there's not a lot of data back products
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's not a lot of expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see good results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, OK, but it's really hard to measure
that if you can't define it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on both sides, I think the
manufacturer should set clear expectations
[SPEAKER_02]: of what the product does for growers and
the growers should set real expectations
[SPEAKER_02]: of why they're using the product and be
able to measure that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yield and quality are pretty,
pretty simple things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about early stage cloning
products or rooting products, let's make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure we can measure root mass and add
these products in to see more root growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I still think biology should be
targeted to a specific function,
[SPEAKER_02]: a specific outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I using this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to measure it and it should do it
just like nutrients and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, water does something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrogen does something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phosphorus does these things that we can
almost measure if we can't completely
[SPEAKER_02]: measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should treat microbes and microbial
innovations the same exact way with rigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I super appreciate you taking the
time to chat with me today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to, you know,
some of the new innovation and things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have going on and, you know,
following up on this trial with the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial mass product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great seeing you and thanks, everybody.
