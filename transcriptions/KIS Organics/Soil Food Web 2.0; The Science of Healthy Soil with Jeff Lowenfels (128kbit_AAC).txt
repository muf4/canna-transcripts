[SPEAKER_04]: last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had our first snowfall last night,
but that doesn't change the topic of what
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to speak about.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I want to present to you is the
updated soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a talk that basically goes through
the science behind organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of an hour, you're going to
know everything you need to know to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: fabulous organic gardener and reasons why
you would not want to be a chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in any case, I call it the updated
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if I can get this to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all the practice we had in COVID,
I guess I got to put play.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that might make some sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I have to do an adjustment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you can see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the author of... Let me just get
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry about this, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, with all the practice we had during
COVID, you'd think once it's over,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'd get it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am the author of the Teaming with
Mike Robes series.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a result, I had a trilogy and I
called myself Lord of the Roots because I
[SPEAKER_04]: thought that was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then these are the books in the
trilogy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gee, it's doing it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can fix that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the trilogy, it turns out, was not
enough because we did have COVID and I had
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing else to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wrote a fourth book and now I have a
quadrilogy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the books basically deal with the fact
that plants produce exudates, things that
[SPEAKER_04]: drip out of the root system by using their
photosynthetic energy and by putting
[SPEAKER_04]: together the nutrients that it obtains
from the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the exudates, a great
picture of the exudates, and these
[SPEAKER_04]: exudates attract microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these microbes are what run our
gardening system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I could talk about it using this
slide, but it's a little understandable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me go this way, make it a little
bit more understandable.
[SPEAKER_04]: About 50% or so of the photosynthetic
energy of a plant is used to produce
[SPEAKER_04]: things that drip out of the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're sweating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your sweat is the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an exudate.
[SPEAKER_04]: These exudates drip out of the roots and
they're designed by the plant to attract
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria and fungi because the bacteria
and fungi don't produce their own carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: They love these exudates because these
exudates are full of carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're right there next to the roots
in what's known as the rhizosphere and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're eating away, having a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then along comes their predators,
nematodes and protozoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the nematodes and protozoa eat the
fungi and the bacteria because they also
[SPEAKER_04]: need carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is carbon contained now in those
fungi and bacteria as a result of eating
[SPEAKER_04]: the exudates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the nematodes and protozoa devour
these fungi and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they excrete the excess that they
don't need.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they excrete turns out to be
plant usable nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: They break down the fungi and bacteria
into nutrients that are usable by the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually have an electrical charge
put on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that they can go into the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's basically the soil food web
that we learned in 2006.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was popularized by a woman named Dr.
Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even that's a little too confusing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me show it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course you've got the little
guys, the nematodes and the protozoa get
[SPEAKER_04]: eaten by bigger guys all the way on off
the chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's look at it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bunch of trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Friday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Fox Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these trees are sitting around talking
to each other through the World Wide Web.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them says, let's have some
Japanese food tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a littler one says, we did that last
week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have some Mexican.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the third one says, no, no,
no, let's have French.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the big tree wins.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're going to have Japanese
food.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the roots of those trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put them in root position.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all that they have to do in order to
get the Japanese food is produce an
[SPEAKER_04]: exudate that they drip out into the into
the soil right there in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they attract the Japanese fungi and
bacteria that they are going for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if one of the plants had said
American food and they decided to have
[SPEAKER_04]: American food, they would change the
exudate.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants are capable of changing the
exudates and dripping them out and
[SPEAKER_04]: attracting American food.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can change the exudates in order
to obtain nutrients and results that they
[SPEAKER_04]: need.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is this is an amazing thing because
we look at plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't walk.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't run away.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't gather things, but they can
produce these exudates, which do all sorts
[SPEAKER_04]: of things for the plant right there in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the soil food web that we
learned back in the very early days.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the basis of teaming with
microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first book, which has been translated
now into 10 languages, not because it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: great book, but because this is how we
learned that the plant feeds itself,
[SPEAKER_04]: not through Miracle Grow, you know,
not through Peters, but through their own
[SPEAKER_04]: natural system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got the name micro mediated
solubilization of soil nutrients 2006.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is teaming with with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, again, a very simple system.
[SPEAKER_04]: The little guys get eaten by the bigger
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's all sorts of consumption and
decay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you end up getting nutrients which go
into the soil and go into the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very simple system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then several years later, it became
very clear that we needed to amend that
[SPEAKER_04]: view because there was something else
going on involving those fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was called mycorrhizal fungi
symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you remember those bacteria and those
fungi that are attracted by those
[SPEAKER_04]: exudates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some of the fungi don't get eaten.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, they get called by the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant sends out a signal and they
enter into the plant and they move between
[SPEAKER_04]: the cells of the plant and they transfer
nutrients which they obtained from the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil into the plant in return for the
exudates that they get.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a picture of mycorrhizal fungi
entering into a root and getting into the
[SPEAKER_04]: insides.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just a fascinating thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out that about 90% of plants
form this symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've known about it since the 1890s,
but we were never able to really duplicate
[SPEAKER_04]: the fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it had no commercial application.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there's no commercial application,
scientific research often slows down to a
[SPEAKER_04]: standstill.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a picture of one of the seven
different kinds.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an important kind that associates
with your trees and around all your tree
[SPEAKER_04]: roots are these hyphal sheets,
these fungal hyphal sheets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some of these fungal go inside
and they form structures in between the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're very elegant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they've been very studied.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some 300 or so different kinds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're capable of making eight to 16 of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what the exact number is,
but they sleep around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one particular type of mycorrhizal
fungi will infect, and that's the right
[SPEAKER_04]: word, many different kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the kind that does the,
again, the trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this is sort of a depiction of
what is really going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have all of these wonderful small
mycorrhizal fungi that are able to go out
[SPEAKER_04]: into the soil in an area where the plant's
root itself can't reach because it's too
[SPEAKER_04]: big.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they collect phosphorus and water.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the things that they bring back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they bring it back to the plant and
the plant says, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some exudates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back and get me more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have this wonderful symbiotic
relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a good thing they do because
again, the root itself goes into the soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it forms a depletion zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so by having these mycorrhizal fungi
go out into the soil, it extends the reach
[SPEAKER_04]: of the root itself, which is an important
thing, obviously, because you don't want
[SPEAKER_04]: plants growing in a depletion zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there are only other choices to
just simply grow down deeper and leaving
[SPEAKER_04]: all these great nutrients there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so this is how a mycorrhizal
fungi works if you don't have a telescope
[SPEAKER_04]: to watch it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got a bunch of seedlings,
two of them sitting out in the sun,
[SPEAKER_04]: again, Fox Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them says, gee, I would really
like a bologna sandwich.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what does it do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it mixes up the right exudates.
[SPEAKER_04]: It puts those exudates out into the soil
and it attracts the kind of fungi that it
[SPEAKER_04]: needs to make a bologna sandwich,
which it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it delivers it to the seedling.
[SPEAKER_04]: The seedling now has established this
relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: The relationship continues and the
seedling grows as a result of the work
[SPEAKER_04]: that the mycorrhizal fungi is doing in
return for getting those exudates.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a very important addition to
the basic 2013 2006 soil food web picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these mycorrhizal fungi do some really
fun things.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can associate with an individual
plant or they can associate with more than
[SPEAKER_04]: one plant and form that web.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not quite the worldwide web that's
been described in the news, but you do get
[SPEAKER_04]: sharing between individual mycorrhizal
fungi and different plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was about 2010.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was called mycorrhizal fungal
symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we started to learn about
something known as endophytic bacterial
[SPEAKER_04]: symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the basis of my fourth book.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be the second book I would
read, incidentally, after Teaming with
[SPEAKER_04]: Microbes, if you were reading the series,
because it's such an important new
[SPEAKER_04]: addition to the way the soil food works.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called endophytic, meaning inside
endophytic plant, inside the plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: bacterial symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it features something known as
rhizophagy, root eating, a discovery that
[SPEAKER_04]: was made back in 2010 in Australia by a
bunch of scientists working at the
[SPEAKER_04]: university, Southern University,
I think it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they discovered was that there
were bacteria just inside plant roots,
[SPEAKER_04]: which they thought occurred as a result of
plant root cells engulfing these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they called that rhizophagy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, they ran out of,
they called it rhizophagy or something of
[SPEAKER_04]: that sort because they had an Australian
accent, but I call it rhizophagy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, they ran out of
funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the whole concept just sort of
languished until 2018 when scientists at
[SPEAKER_04]: Rutgers University picked up this
discovery and using new kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: microscopes really figured out what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a whopper.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, some of those fungi don't get
eaten.
[SPEAKER_04]: They form the mycorrhizal fungus that are
attracted by the exonates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of those bacteria, they also
don't get eaten.
[SPEAKER_04]: They form what's known as the rhizophagy
cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to first point out that
bacteria, incredibly small.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the proverbial pin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are the bacteria on the tip of
the pin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're incredibly small.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: They multiply every 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't really study enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: We study dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't study things like microbes that
are important, but these are really
[SPEAKER_04]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want you to keep this picture in mind
as we go through some of these next
[SPEAKER_04]: slides.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bacteria are attracted by that
exodate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here are some bacteria, bunches of
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: That are attracted to the root tip of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're there and they're devouring up
the exodates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, a lot of these are going to get eaten
by nematodes and protozoa, but this is
[SPEAKER_04]: before that has occurred.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens is they form a bacterial
slime.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have a bunch of bacteria,
they form a slime in order to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: hide from their predators in order to be
able to trap food sources.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why you brush your teeth in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a slime on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to use energy in order to remove
that slime.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a real protective layer.
[SPEAKER_04]: These certain bacteria, these rhizophagy
bacteria are living in the slime with a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of other bacteria, some of which are
going to get eaten.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they smell something very familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: They smell a popcorn smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this popcorn smell indicates to them
that there is a empty slime facility right
[SPEAKER_04]: next door.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they should go live there because
there won't be so much competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they move into that new slime area,
attracted by this smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only if there isn't a slime area,
what they end up doing is breaking through
[SPEAKER_04]: these very thin walls at the tip of roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very thin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thin walls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they break through it thinking they're
going into a new slime colony.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they break through these cell walls
and they end up in a particular spot in
[SPEAKER_04]: the cell that's known as the paraplasmic
space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm throwing a lot of science at you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I try to make it easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The paraplasmic space is this little space
between, well, let me make it really easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the guts of the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's this little area around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The easiest thing to think of is tofu.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the guts of the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's the water all the way around
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the paraplasmic space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these bacteria back through,
they smell that popcorn smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're attracted again by the plant
itself, just like the mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_04]: are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they back into this paraplasmic space
where they find themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the paraplasmic space, they live
and they multiply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because every 20 minutes they multiply.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after 20 minutes of being in there,
they're doubling their numbers and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: cycled.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little cyclosis going around
inside the cell that moves stuff around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this moves as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here you can see, here's another
picture, different kind of bacteria,
[SPEAKER_04]: different kind of plant cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these are those endophytic rhizophagy
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're inside there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they get in there, the plant
goes, hmm, I got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want these guys to take over and
kill me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the plant sprays the bacteria with
something known as a ROS, a reactive
[SPEAKER_04]: oxygen series.
[SPEAKER_04]: ROS is quite simply what causes sunburn.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you get sunburned, it's because your
cells are producing a ROS to protect
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves from the UV rays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they produce a ROS to protect
themselves from these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, I even found a ROS with a
sunburn just so that we could tie
[SPEAKER_04]: everything together.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, this ROS has the effect of
stripping off the bacteria cell wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the bacteria end up without cell
walls and the plant cell absorbs the
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients that were the bacterial cell
wall and use them to grow, which is a
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the bacteria, as you can imagine,
they don't like to get sprayed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It stresses them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But by the same token, I should add,
it also stresses out the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the plant's not careful and sprays
the wrong or the too higher concentration
[SPEAKER_04]: of ROS, it hurts itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so by spraying the ROS on the
bacteria, it has to strengthen its own
[SPEAKER_04]: cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the plant becomes stronger as a
result of these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they get this induced stress
resistance, which lives throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant for the rest of the plant's life
that makes the plant stronger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it also turns out that the bacteria
don't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they do two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing they do is they produce
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethylene causes the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a phytohormone, and it causes the
plant cell to stretch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they also produce nitrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the ethylene and the nitrate react and
weaken the ROS.
[SPEAKER_04]: They produce different things that weaken
the ROS so that even though they've lost
[SPEAKER_04]: their cell wall, they're not going to get
killed by continued application.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it weakens the ROS.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these wall-less bacteria continue to
cycle in that periplasmic space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they continue to multiply as they
produce this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cell is stretched.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they take a little bit of carbon,
these bacteria, and they form a cycle,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is very, very important in order for
the bacteria to keep alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in order for the plant to keep alive,
these cycles form.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cell continues to stretch.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bacteria continue to multiply.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they produce their ethylene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the protection that they produce is
actually nitrous.
[SPEAKER_04]: They take nitrogen from the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they fix that nitrogen to form nitrous
oxide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which also weakens the ROS.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they got this ethylene and this
nitrous oxide weakening the ROS.
[SPEAKER_04]: What they're doing is they're fixing
nitrogen inside the plant cell,
[SPEAKER_04]: just like rhizobia bacteria do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is completely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is inside the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out that if the Raza Fasi
cycle is going on, up to 40% of the
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen that a plant uses I'm going to
repeat that.
[SPEAKER_04]: 40% of the nitrogen that a plant uses
comes from this internal nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: fixation, which we had no idea was going
on before 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you haven't ever heard of this
before, it's because no one has.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I would say you're probably a
group of 4,000 people who may know about
[SPEAKER_04]: Raza Fasi.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everybody's going to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you've got, again, this is the
depiction.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the paraplasmic space.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bacteria are moving around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're being cycled around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And inside the paraplasmic space is a
membrane and all the goodies that are
[SPEAKER_04]: inside the chloroplasts and all that kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're interested in this area right
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you continue to get growth as these
bacteria are cycled around, multiplying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, they're very very very small.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they multiply and they begin to form
structures like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a multiplied wall-less bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all throughout the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they begin to form like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: They begin to conglomerate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get more and more of them because you
continue to get this multiplication.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they begin to clog up the pathway,
so to speak, and back up against the wall
[SPEAKER_04]: of the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they back up against the wall of
the cell, the ethylene concentrates
[SPEAKER_04]: against that wall and forms a tube.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the tubes that are being
formed off of the main cell of a root tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look carefully here, you can see
this is with the tube.
[SPEAKER_04]: See the tube being formed and it's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see a little bit of the tube here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a brand new cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of this cell right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this little hair that grows out of
the root.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a root hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a shocker, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single root hair you've ever seen
has bacteria in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do I know that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the bacteria are what cause root
hairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were all brought up to believe that
root hairs grow so that the plant can get
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go out into the soil, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow because they're putting these
bacteria into them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're getting bacteria filled.
[SPEAKER_04]: They happen to be very thin walled.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did a tremendous amount of study,
again, because it was COVID and because I
[SPEAKER_04]: had the ability to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are very thin walled structures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they open up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's no wonder that if you read
Teaming with Nutrients, one of the other
[SPEAKER_04]: books I wrote, which talks about how
plants take nutrients in, the nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: are able to move through these incredibly
thin walls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they do take up nutrients,
but they are formed by bacteria for a
[SPEAKER_04]: completely different purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what happens is they continue to
multiply as they move into these cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're in the cells and they begin to
multiply and they get conglomerated up at
[SPEAKER_04]: the tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this blue indicates that there's
nitrogen being produced from these little
[SPEAKER_04]: guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the dye.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden, they are blown
out of the tip of that growing tube,
[SPEAKER_04]: which we call a root hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they go back out into the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here they are conglomerating in the
tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: And boom, out they go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here they are, blown out into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are wall-less bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So are these.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they grow back their cell wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in two or three days, they move back
into a new root cell and form new root
[SPEAKER_04]: hairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't happen just once.
[SPEAKER_04]: As that root hair grows, you get explosion
after explosion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they go back into the soil and
they grow back their cell wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is clearly amazing stuff to most
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They work, they eat, they travel,
they repeat, they go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an incredible system.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's now called the Razorphagy cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been observed, obviously,
in many different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you remove the bacteria, you do not get
root hairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we used to think is that the
plant, by producing the exudates and
[SPEAKER_04]: putting the exudates out into the soil,
was sort of farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it would gather in in the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would bring in all the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we're learning is they also are
herding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're ranchers as well as farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they go out and they bring these
bacteria in.
[SPEAKER_04]: They shear off the walls.
[SPEAKER_04]: They eat an occasional leg of lamb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they put them back out into the
paddock to grow back the wall again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely an unbelievable thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's known as Razorphagy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may not have ever heard of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will hear lots about it because it
turns out that it's a very useful research
[SPEAKER_04]: tool and potentially an unbelievable
substitute for actual chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what the world's been looking
for for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, those Razorphagy bacteria that move
in are endophytic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as these roots begin to grow,
you end up with little cracks in the main
[SPEAKER_04]: root itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because bacteria are everywhere and
because bacteria are always looking for an
[SPEAKER_04]: advantage over other bacteria so that they
can go to a place where they can breed
[SPEAKER_04]: without predators and where they can eat
without competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a bunch of bacteria that would
have been eaten, perhaps, by nematodes and
[SPEAKER_04]: protozoa that sneak in the cracks that
form when these root hairs form as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they sneak in.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very, very small.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're capable of moving
throughout the plant in the phylum or the
[SPEAKER_04]: xylem and even in the atheroplastic
pathways in between cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you end up with endophytic bacteria
throughout the root and they move into the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some move in through stomata, but most of
them come in through the root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them end up in the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as the flower is forming seeds,
they get trapped in the seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're inside the seed so that when
the seed is planted in new soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: the seed brings with it the kinds of
bacteria that it needs in order to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, an unbelievable discovery.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are corn plants, species that are
400 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you plant one today, it has the
same bacterial mix or a very close
[SPEAKER_04]: bacterial mix to what it had 400 years ago
because it carries its seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is probably where terroir comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the soil, but the microbes that are in
the plant that come from the soil and get
[SPEAKER_04]: passed on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an amazing, amazing thing while we're
studying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, again, you get the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get trapped.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the plant germinates, the bacteria
move into the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them end up as rhizofascia
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them end up as endophytic
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a beautiful, beautiful system.
[SPEAKER_04]: These bacteria, these endophytic bacteria
are capable of producing hormones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they produce the key hormones that
you need for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the plants, obviously, can produce
these as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when they get assisted by these
bacteria, it's a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why would a bacteria do this?
[SPEAKER_04]: It would produce these things inside a
plant because it's tricking the plant into
[SPEAKER_04]: allowing it to live inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plant says, oh, yeah, I get some
oxygen out of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, gee, I get some ethylene out of
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll let these guys stay here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bacteria gets to live without the
competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets a source of food without
competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody lives happily ever after.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you end up with all sorts of things as
a result of these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stress that's created causes some
wonderful things to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: This induces systemic resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you also get all of these things
occurring as well as a result of these
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria moving in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I might add some fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Particularly, yeasts do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_04]: They act like these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they go through an endophytic phase of
their life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these endophytic bacteria help plants
to deal with abiotic stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can lower the freezing point of water
or raise the freezing point of water,
[SPEAKER_04]: excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can help a plant deal with salt,
with flooding, with drought.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can help plants deal with pathogens
that are attacking them.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant can selectively allow in a
bacteria that's able to take out some of
[SPEAKER_04]: its pathogens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a wonderful, terrific defense system
if you can get the bacteria to do your
[SPEAKER_04]: fighting for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you give up is a little bit of space
and maybe a little bit of carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these bacteria are capable of
doing things like pliating iron.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they'll enter into a plant root.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll live inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when the plant has either got too much
iron or doesn't have enough iron,
[SPEAKER_04]: they can hop out into the soil where they
can gather up all the iron together or
[SPEAKER_04]: arsenic together so that it doesn't go in
and poison the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they do all sorts of wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are, Tad and I were talking,
just the beginnings of endophytic bacteria
[SPEAKER_04]: that are producible and are available.
[SPEAKER_04]: These top ones up here are things that you
can get at cannabis growth stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're beginning to use them.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one fixes nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's different kinds depending on what
areas you live in.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one from Brazil and Russia,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is one that people are beginning
to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: These can be stored relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This requires freeze drying.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people are trying to figure out how to
use these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what big industry has discovered is
that it's possible to find and to isolate
[SPEAKER_04]: endophytic bacteria that do things to your
plant that you need them to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, if you're growing a tomato
and you end up with powdery mildew all the
[SPEAKER_04]: time, if research has it proper,
they're gonna find the right bacterium to
[SPEAKER_04]: put into the soil so that it goes into the
plant and fights off that powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_04]: so that you don't end up getting that
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not doing it for me and you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing it for the big guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it'll come down to our level,
no question about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these three are already on or getting
close to our level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as rhizobia, bacteria have come down
to our level.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find rhizobia bacteria and
nitrogen-fixing bacteria wherever you buy
[SPEAKER_04]: legumes as an inoculant for your peas and
other legumes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the really obvious takeaway,
plants really are in control.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you go by the original soil food
web or you move all the way through to the
[SPEAKER_04]: modern view of the soil food web,
which includes the razzophagy,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're in control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we like to think we're in control,
but when we think that, we end up taking
[SPEAKER_04]: actions that are not necessarily in the
soil food web's best interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: We interfere with the way the soil food
web works.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we end up having to do a lot of work
ourselves as a result of taking away the
[SPEAKER_04]: ability of these invisible microbes to do
the work for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So plants are definitely in control and
they're amazing, which is really the most
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing takeaway.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just completely had no idea that they
were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We keep getting better and better at
microscopy and at staining.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a result, we're beginning to see
what plants can actually do.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where I usually pop in and say,
we've got to stop teaching our kids about
[SPEAKER_04]: dinosaurs, useless.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to start teaching our kids about
microbes because they impact everything we
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're absolutely stunning and gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can make them every bit as interesting
as, you know, as the Tyrosonus Rex and all
[SPEAKER_04]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing to me that a four or five
year old kid knows all the dinosaurs,
[SPEAKER_04]: knows even how to spell some of these
incredibly complicated words I can't even
[SPEAKER_04]: say, and yet has no idea what a bacteria
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chemicals obviously have a negative effect
on endophytic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: They throw things out of balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got to be very careful how you
use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to use the best practices
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the things that keep a soil food
web alive also help the Razofesi cycle and
[SPEAKER_04]: endophytic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mulches, leaving leaves alone,
using compost, even compost teas,
[SPEAKER_04]: compost extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all things that help the soil
food web are considered to be best
[SPEAKER_04]: practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: No rototilling, which breaks everything up
and destroys the soil food web,
[SPEAKER_04]: or at least impacts the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that has to rebuild itself and you lose
that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of these things are important.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: The soil is everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can test things.
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite test these days is something
called the microbiometer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you need to have an NPK test every
now and then so you know what your soils
[SPEAKER_04]: have in it and what they're capable of
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you need to know whether what you're
doing is helping the soil food web or
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it's hurting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go look at www.microbiometer.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this really cool test.
[SPEAKER_04]: You use your cell phone and you can tell
whether you're increasing or decreasing
[SPEAKER_04]: the biomass, the bacterial and fungal
biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it increases, you're doing good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it decreases as a result of what
you're doing, you're doing something
[SPEAKER_04]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't disturb the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prevent compaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: No tilling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your soil is the most valuable thing we
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a silly thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't necessarily use sterile soil
either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those seeds contain the bacteria that your
plant needs in order to live.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they germinate, you want to have them
be able to do so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use mulches.
[SPEAKER_04]: They provide organic material,
which all of the soil food web needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't rototilt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't toss.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reuse it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It contains exudates.
[SPEAKER_04]: It contains bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: It contains organic material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And compost, compost, compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make compost out of the same plants you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It contains a lot of the goodies that your
plants used and would use again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Test your compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some plants, because compost has different
kinds of bacteria in it, like
[SPEAKER_04]: vermicompost, and some plants like
thermocompost more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which ones?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to do the research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a home scientific experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're going to find that your
broccoli is going to do better in one kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of compost versus the other, because the
bacterial composition is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll get different endophytic
bacteria along with the ones that come
[SPEAKER_04]: along with the seed that you're planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not so obvious takeaways.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to read these books,
folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not because I wrote them, but because this
is the science behind organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we've learned anything,
it's that we need to be organic gardeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have way too much plastic in our lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have way too much plastic in our soils,
for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to add chemicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just have screwed things up so badly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know it's caused bad things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start with teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Move to teaming with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: Learn how and then go to endophytic fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then learn how the plants use all of
these things to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do these things, you will be a much
better gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chemical gardeners are not good gardeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: To learn how to use the soil food web,
on the other hand, is how you become the
[SPEAKER_04]: very best gardener you possibly can be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say, is this the end?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no question some other thing is
going to be discovered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knew in 2017 that you could get 40% of
your plants' nitrogen just by simply
[SPEAKER_04]: making sure that the Rasmus-Fezzi cycle is
going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: No one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's got to be more stuff out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are people looking for this stuff
all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're taking notes, write down the
name of Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_04]: She is the guru of the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: Write down the name of Dr. James White.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is the gentleman at Rutgers University
who has really refined the Rasmus-Fezzi
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate your attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be happy to answer any questions you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't hear you, but I see you're
clapping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there any questions I can relay?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you find out about Plant a Row for
the Hungry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm glad you asked that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant a Row for Hungry is sort of a
self-service program that we used to be
[SPEAKER_04]: the garden writers of America.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're now the garden community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you go to
gardencommunicatorsinternational.com,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll find a page that talks about Plant
a Row for the Hungry.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have to do is share food with
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a club, for example, just to encourage
everybody to plant one row in their
[SPEAKER_04]: garden, the gardener takes that food
either to a neighbor that needs it,
[SPEAKER_04]: to a church or a synagogue, to a food
bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are places where you can take food
to a prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: The prison gathers the food.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got hardware stores that gather
food.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got nurseries, garden nurseries,
where you can bring in excess food.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll take it to the food bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no rules to this other than you
plant the row, you distribute that row
[SPEAKER_04]: somehow, and nothing slips between the lip
and the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no money involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no administrative services
involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a people-to-people campaign,
and it is unbelievable if you just Google
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant a Row for the Hungry, how many
different programs people have come up
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do it in Canada now as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're beginning to do it in England.
[SPEAKER_04]: 35 million people go to bed in North
America hungry every single night,
[SPEAKER_04]: or at least not knowing when their next
meal is coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is such an easy thing because
gardeners share, and because most of us
[SPEAKER_04]: tend to just sort of leave stuff in the
garden, you know, when the snow comes for
[SPEAKER_04]: the moose to eat, and that's a stupid
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you able to hear that, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about nitrogen fixation crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you expand on cover crops and how they
make them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cover crops, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, cover crops are mostly
legumes, and they produce the nodules that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're familiar with, and inside those
nodules, they produce nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little teeny bit of that nitrogen leaks
out into the soil and is used by whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: plants would grow in there, but what
happens is the cover crop dies,
[SPEAKER_04]: and when it dies, the nitrogen that's in
the cover crop itself, particularly in the
[SPEAKER_04]: nodules, goes into the soil and is then
used usable.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you could plant a cover crop in
the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's producing those nodules.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's producing nitrogen for itself,
and then in the spring, you tamp it over
[SPEAKER_04]: or you just rake it over, maybe a little
light tilling, and that moves that
[SPEAKER_04]: material into the soil with a dead plant
and provides that nitrogen, releases it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clovers are the most common one you hear
of, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I've been testing a new
clover.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called micro clover.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really new, but the new trend is
for people to put in not lawns,
[SPEAKER_04]: but meadows, to turn their lawns into
meadows, and one of the easiest ways to do
[SPEAKER_04]: that is to add tremendous amounts of
clover.
[SPEAKER_04]: This micro clover, it only blooms once a
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worth taking a look at, but it pumps
in nitrogen like crazy, and in addition to
[SPEAKER_04]: using it on my lawn, I've used it on my
tomato plants, and I got to tell you,
[SPEAKER_04]: it makes the most gorgeous tomato plants
I've ever seen, this mound of beautiful
[SPEAKER_04]: clover, and then after I harvest the
tomatoes, I'm going to kill it,
[SPEAKER_04]: so next year, they're going to get the
benefit of this nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you suggest using compost if we're
not tilling, just as a top dress?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The compost, and you really don't need
very much, an eighth of an inch is enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: An inch is, wow, a tremendous amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you put it on top of the soil,
the microbes in it, as well as the rain,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera, work the microbes down into the
soil down into the growing zone in a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of two or three, four or five
months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put it right on the surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: In places like Anchorage, and you get a
little bit of cold weather, it acts as a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit of an insulation layer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to put the compost down and then
put leaves on top of it as mulch so that
[SPEAKER_04]: it holds the temperature in the soil to 29
to 30 degrees in our frost zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It raises the frost zone so that we don't
get quite as deep frost, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love compost, it's great stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tad makes some very good compost,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can follow up on that, I've also read
studies that are showing that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting too much organic material in a lot
of our herb soils because of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've read some of those too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most regular soils has about one to 2%
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really good organic garden bed might have
up to 5% organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you have too much organic matter?
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose you could if you weren't getting
soil structure, if it was replacing the
[SPEAKER_04]: individual, but it's hard for me to see
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see how maybe if you use manure in
your compost, you may end up with too much
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphorus or too much potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be probably a more thing,
but I don't buy into it, frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't mean I'm right, but I just
don't buy into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put as much compost down as I've grown
directly in compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Organic matter all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never rake a leaf unless it's for
putting down on the garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grow potatoes in just leaves,
which is all organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have a hard time, but again,
these are scientific papers.
[SPEAKER_04]: People, Linda, Chalker, Scott,
et cetera, they write these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be some validity to it,
but I haven't had that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a picture of red worms, and I've
never fully used to advantage the castings
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've generated my worm in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a good way to distribute that
stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the value of the worm casting as
far as who's living in it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear that?
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, how do you collect the
worm castings?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you use them on?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I best use them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a massive problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got a lot, but how do you best
utilize them, and what's the value of
them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I use them in two different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also keep worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, now that we see the snow,
I'm going to have to move it inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use them by putting them in liquid
and making a worm compost extract and
[SPEAKER_04]: using that liquid on plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know really why I do that,
but sometimes I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I put it right on my plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you've got to be careful because they
will contain little worm castings,
[SPEAKER_04]: little eggs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to make sure you've got the
right worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want that new worm that's moving
in that does the fast squiggly wiggly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a particularly big fan of adding
night crawlers if you don't already have
[SPEAKER_04]: night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_04]: The red wigglers seem to be safe,
but I sometimes wonder whether we're
[SPEAKER_04]: really doing the right thing by using
them, but using the castings themselves
[SPEAKER_04]: does make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: They contain a concentration of the
nutrients that is higher than what went
[SPEAKER_04]: into the worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember exactly what the numbers
are.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's X amount of times more phosphorus,
X amount of times more nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_04]: X amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got higher concentrations of the
nutrients that you want for your plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's why it's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is research on adding worm castings
to potting soils, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they found up to I think 15% by
volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this depends on the quality of
castings and things like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they actually got increased biomass
production, growth, disease protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: The worm castings have a lot of benefits
in soils in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think because they contain so many
nutrients, they raise the bricks of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the bricks of the plant is over nine or
10, you don't get insects anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's every bit as good as compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: One's thermal and one's biological,
so there's a different mix of bacteria in
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will let you go then, but I really
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody has any questions, let me know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always tell people if you buy teaming
with microbes, and now I'm going to add in
[SPEAKER_04]: teaming with bacteria, and you don't like
it, I'll buy it back at three times the
[SPEAKER_04]: price because I think it's that important
that you read it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to read it in French or German
or Slovakian or Turkish, Portuguese or
[SPEAKER_04]: Spanish, we can arrange to get you that
copy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And audible now, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's audible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on discs.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same person that read John Stewart's
book reads mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a great audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
