[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Dr. Allison Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allison graduated from Clemson University
with a PhD in plant and environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: During her time at Clemson, Allison taught
greenhouse management to undergraduate
[SPEAKER_00]: students where they focused on organic
methods and production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allison's dissertation involved
investigating the effects of a beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal type organism, Piriformospora
india, where she learned that organic
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable growing can be easy,
cost-effective, and produce aesthetically
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasing plants when done properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through research, Allison is elevating the
standards of cannabis cultivation both
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors and in greenhouse settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allison has worked for Outco, a vertically
integrated cannabis company in San Diego
[SPEAKER_00]: for the past three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outco was one of the first companies to
integrate LEDs on mobile racking systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This decision was backed by rigorous
experimentation conducted with Fluence
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioengineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allison has made a recent move from San
Diego back to South Carolina where she is
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allison is a co-founder of SC Botanicals,
a large-scale CBD extraction facility in
[SPEAKER_00]: South Carolina, and the hemp mine,
Allison's 40-acre family hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Justice has been appointed to the
California Industrial Hemp Advisory Board
[SPEAKER_00]: through May of 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was also named one of the 40 under 40
in cannabis by Marijuana Venture Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to get her on the show
today and share some of the research that
[SPEAKER_00]: she's been doing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Allison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we start off by giving listeners
a little bit of a background into your
[SPEAKER_00]: life and how you got to the role that you
have now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it all goes back to being a
child and kind of having being born with a
[SPEAKER_01]: green thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my grandparents were cotton farmers in
South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up on a large ball and burlap tree
farm in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every summer, every holiday, I was busy
playing with plants or digging holes,
[SPEAKER_01]: picking vegetables, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it came time to pick a degree,
absolutely, it had to be horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did go to Clemson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I received a bachelor's in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, I took a couple of years off
to kind of figure out what I wanted to do
[SPEAKER_01]: and also worked for our family tree farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured out very quickly that I wanted
to get back into the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to discover more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went to grad school for plant and
environmental science at Clemson as well
[SPEAKER_01]: to see my PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did a direct doctorate.
[SPEAKER_01]: After my PhD, I started a consulting
company where I was mainly consulting for
[SPEAKER_01]: IPM for large greenhouses across the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my grad student studies were mainly on
looking at organic methods, mainly looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at a endophyte, piriformis spora indica,
and how it helps ornamental greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: plants take up nutrients, how it has the
potential to fight off disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: and even promote auxin for root formation
and cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided I wanted to do some
consulting to help these companies
[SPEAKER_01]: implement microbes of different sorts and
actually develop a system of rearing
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nematodes, as an organism,
are very, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different sorts of nematodes,
starting with Carpacaceae, starting with
[SPEAKER_01]: LTI, that all attack different insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the way that you're able to get
these nematodes today are basically in a
[SPEAKER_01]: brewed and dried concoction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what a lot of the studies were showing
is that nematodes reared inside of hosts,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually wax worms, were more effective at
fighting off different pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was teaching farmers how to rear
their own nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus buying them in a dormant,
frozen basically form.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I was consulting, I eventually started
getting asked to consult for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, which at the time, living in
South Carolina, I didn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: consider cannabis as an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely supported it, but the career
path for it was not clear to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: and still isn't for a lot of people here
in South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why I did develop an internship
program, which we can talk about later if
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But started getting questions from
cannabis growers, started consulting,
[SPEAKER_01]: and saw very quickly that it was a rising
industry and an industry that needed
[SPEAKER_01]: science, and that was very, very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so eventually, I was asked to come out
and visit ALTCO in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: And was offered a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really had no intentions to move,
but it was a good offer, and just the
[SPEAKER_01]: science that I could achieve very quickly
with cannabis just seemed so fun,
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did move to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have actually just moved back to South
Carolina, but I was in San Diego for about
[SPEAKER_01]: three years as a VP of cultivation there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still actually am VP of cultivation for
ALTCO, but in the meantime, during those
[SPEAKER_01]: three years, about a year in, South
Carolina passed the bill to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my family being all farmers,
already having land and some greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: I encouraged them to apply for a permit,
and they actually got one of the first 20
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses given in South Carolina to grow
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was exciting, and we went down
the road of cultivation, but then we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: very quickly, well, there's no one here to
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that are coming in state
and offering extraction services,
[SPEAKER_01]: 99% of them were basically sharks,
and saying, oh, we'll give you $5,000 an
[SPEAKER_01]: acre for your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll buy it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, they should be making at least
$100,000 an acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ALTCO being vertically integrated,
already had Dr. Marcus Rogan, a brilliant
[SPEAKER_01]: chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided to build an extraction facility
here in South Carolina for CBD for hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, and partnered with my family's
company, ALTCO, and as well as an
[SPEAKER_01]: investor, of course, and built SC
Botanicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we extract, so not only my family,
but other farmers across South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a part of that extraction,
service, I'm here to help with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the planting, because if we're growing
good plants with high potency,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's wanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I stand back in South Carolina
now, with a lot of different things going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely been an interesting three
plus years, but I can't tell you how much
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned with this one single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so interesting, because I was just
recently at that soil scientist meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: that I told you about, and Ron Turco with
Purdue University was talking,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was talking about how everyone was
getting into hemp right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his big question to him was,
what are you going to do after you've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown the hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to extract it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no infrastructure for that in a
lot of these states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you're going to be filling a
really important need there at SC
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of the states where we're seeing
that hemp, it's already been in production
[SPEAKER_01]: for a number of years now, like Oregon and
Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the starting plants, and it is the
extraction that's the bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of good farmers out there,
but propagation specialists or extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: specialists is kind of where the need is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so building those companies is,
I think, important right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great what you guys are
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say, I've been a big fan of
your work now for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually heard about you long before I
met you because of an article that was
[SPEAKER_00]: published talking about how you were able
to reduce Outco's expenses on the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: side by moving away from essentially what
we're calling bottled nutrients or a
[SPEAKER_00]: branded marketed nutrient line that's
specific for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be willing to talk a little bit
about that process?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you came into Outco and how you made
those changes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first got to Outco, they were
already in operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the good first few months of my
time was just simply investigating what
[SPEAKER_01]: they were already doing and comparing to
methods I had been using previously with
[SPEAKER_01]: non-cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first one that really stuck out to
me was these giant vats of liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients with names of companies I'd
never heard of with silly pictures on the
[SPEAKER_01]: front and basically fertilizer labels that
didn't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as I start digging through it,
there's a lot of, as you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of magic and special sauce
that fertilizer companies like to put into
[SPEAKER_01]: their bottles, but at the end of the day,
you know, the plant needs its essential
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, you know, through
experimentation, through research,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I found that cannabis is a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, as we know, but it is,
it's a special plant, but it's a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that also is a plant that needs its 16
essential nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as I developed our own
fertilizer recipe, you know, what I found
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's very similar to poinsettia and
tomato with a few tweaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it took me about three
years to decipher what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think as of this week, I've just
kind of put together all the facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, I'm going to give you a
little bit of my conspiracy theory of
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on with bottled nutrients
and, you know, the idea of levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients that are needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, let me just say, you know,
I did run through an experiment where,
[SPEAKER_01]: a controlled experiment where I'm looking
at two different commercial fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_01]: very popular one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone listening has known or used or at
least heard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to name any names because I
don't want to be that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when you actually look at,
when you're able to compare their
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations versus what's actually in
the bottle, it's really flabbergasting
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're having you apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, what I found was in the bottle,
one, didn't match the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, you know, compared to other
plants, the amount of mineral nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: we're putting on is just outrageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's just plain horrifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, because of this,
I think, I think the organic side,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with what you're doing actually
has more knowledge and more, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: it is extremely complicated when you're
getting, you know, lots and lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's complicated because of all the
cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you almost have a better grasp
on what's going on than a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are using mineral nutrients,
which is kind of backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a push from the
fertilizer companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then I'll, I'll get back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, looking at my experiments,
nitrogen for a regular plant, should be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 50 to maxing out in the,
you know, low 200s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of these companies specifically
during the, you know, week six or so,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting up to about 400 parts per
million nitrogen, double of what any other
[SPEAKER_01]: plant possibly sees.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, with these results,
I'm correlating with leased tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with nitrogen, even though you're
applying twice as much as what a normal
[SPEAKER_01]: plant needs, when you look at the results,
the amount of nitrogen that's took up in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is not double.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely the same as our control
fertilizer, which is 150 parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where is that fertilizer going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Out at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing for potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing for phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus specifically is you know,
very, very bad for the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely great for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the amount we are applying,
I would say at least 80, 85% is going
[SPEAKER_01]: right out the bottom of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of the ways that growers
deal with this high EC is by flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason you're having to flush is
because you're applying so much nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you didn't, your plant would
absolutely die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say that's really
interesting because I know when we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: at Photo X, at that time, you were
thinking it was primarily phosphates that
[SPEAKER_00]: was leaching, which is a huge issue,
like you mentioned, and something we've
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed on this podcast before from a
sustainability perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you're seeing nitrates and
potassium as well, then it sounds like?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything that's in these
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, compared to what our control
plant needed and compared to other
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer recipes, every single thing
that's being applied is at least three
[SPEAKER_01]: times too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's twofold.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, the growers are putting themselves in
a bind because they have this idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: they need more phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're applying phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you get over about 100 parts per
million phosphorus, you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: precipitating out your iron, zinc,
and possibly calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if you're increasing
your P, you're also having to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: those others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's this back and forth,
you know, increase of nutrients that's
[SPEAKER_01]: just not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole reason being because you've
put too much and it's not being able to be
[SPEAKER_01]: taken up by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's really interesting
because we have this perception as growers
[SPEAKER_00]: that the more we put on, the bigger our
plant will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people have this tendency to
continue to add nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it dates back to this concept
that plant that cannabis plants need
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen for veg and phosphorus for bloom,
leading back to a really popular cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: book that came out, I think, in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this this sort of myth has carried
on for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do see that what you're saying here
around especially around phosphorus being
[SPEAKER_00]: over applied, it's a really common problem
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I was trying to figure
out what is the reasoning?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the reasoning?
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers think that they need so much
phosphorus with any other plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the low would be eight parts
with the high being maybe 15 parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, with looking through these
commercial fertilizer recommendations,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're putting on upwards of 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant literally cannot take up
that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just being wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm not going to take claim of this
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, with talking with Dr. Royal
Hines, Brian Kaur and Jim Barrett,
[SPEAKER_01]: they found a study from 1977, which I have
no idea how they performed the study in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's called responses of
greenhouse-grown cannabis to nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's an interesting
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm worried that this is what backed
this whole phosphorus push.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're reading it quickly and
not necessarily doing the math,
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks like, OK, well, you need a
hundred and fifty parts per million
[SPEAKER_01]: applied to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the normal person would
think, OK, well, that's every watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you dig a little deeper,
which their materials and methods are
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty inadequate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of hard to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, what it's actually talking
about is 150 milligrams per kilogram of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, not 150 parts per million per
watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you do the math further,
it's actually equaling about 15 parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million each watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so looking at their study,
they're going from 15 parts per million
[SPEAKER_01]: being the high application rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind that cannabis liquid
fertilizer companies are recommending
[SPEAKER_01]: about 200 parts per million phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their medium range of five parts per
million and their low was zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as you would imagine, when you look
through the data, yeah, they're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: higher, higher yield in flower and
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting higher THC content,
which was only point five percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what strains they were
growing, but it's really low anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're not doing this math,
you're thinking, wow, wow, if I really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really increase my phosphorus,
I'm going to get higher everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's only 15 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, by by reading that
study, was it being the only one out at
[SPEAKER_01]: that time?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that could have started started
this crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no doubt phosphorus does
increase flowering and breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to what, you know, how much do you
have to use to actually get that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next thought is, you know,
a lot of plants out there will turn purple
[SPEAKER_01]: when there's phosphorus restriction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of my studies in grad school
was looking at some patients and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, instead of applying plant growth
regulators like ornamental ornamental
[SPEAKER_01]: growers do very consistently, instead of
using PGRs, can we just apply less
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, not inhibit flowering and get
a smaller, more compact plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we found was if we use three
parts per million, the plant would be very
[SPEAKER_01]: stout, not, you know, long and gangly,
which is great for ornamental plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did not inhibit flowering, but it was
very, very purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's supposed to be a green
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so did that matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, once we applied adequate phosphorus
at 10 parts per million, it green right up
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it flowered normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wonder if I've heard lots of
people say this, you know, when the stems
[SPEAKER_01]: are turning purple or, yeah, when the
stems are turning purple, that's got to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a phosphorus deficiency and they need to
add more phosphorus when one that's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably not the deficiency sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're actually just adding more
salt and probably making your problem
[SPEAKER_01]: worse simply just being a stress,
maybe a stressor response.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some just early naturally purple
stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, could that be also related to
temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen purpling stems most commonly
correlated with cold temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would allow less, as I understood
it, less movement of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what was sort of making that
show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are you seeing other reasons for
purpling in stems?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've definitely seen purpling
increase with cold temperatures and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is a flower of leaves that stands
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm specifically talking about times when
to me the plant is just stressed in
[SPEAKER_01]: general and growers will just
automatically associate that with a
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus deficiency because of that
purple color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily with cold temperature,
but yeah, absolutely the plants do turn
[SPEAKER_01]: purple once if you drop the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I hear the most is any time you
see any chlorosis in the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: like interveinal chlorosis or anything
like that, it's always Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're always adding Cal Mag
because that's what's causing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that one that you've heard of or seen a
lot of too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Cal Mag thing kind of throws me
off a little because Cal Mag, it's not one
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually maybe calcium chloride and
magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I see interveinal chlorosis,
I think it's a magnesium deficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would want to do some increase of
Epsom salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think the general term people
throw around of Cal Mag is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: we should think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need to increase the calcium or do
you need to increase the magnesium?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should be a little smarter and be
able to diagnose that and apply the right
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient versus just some bottle of two
mixed different molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I understand it, Cal Mag isn't even
typically the right ratio for what plants
[SPEAKER_00]: need, at least from what we're aiming for
on the organic side as a ratio between
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I wanted to get back to was
when you created your own fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you talk just really quickly on the
economic benefits of that for Outco when
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys made the switch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we originally switched,
we were actually saving 24 times the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which if anybody knows, one of the biggest
costs is fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just paying for a brand is
absolutely ridiculous when you can go down
[SPEAKER_01]: to the local agriculture store and get all
of your ingredients that are tested for
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals and pesticides and whatever
else you might be worrisome for for
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely pennies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess my skepticism comes from one
grad school where we're asked to question
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, but also being raised on a
farm when you don't have money,
[SPEAKER_01]: extra money just to throw around because
it's the craze.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have reasons behind all of
your choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not that everybody has the capability
to mix their own fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are absolutely agricultural
shops that can assist you with making
[SPEAKER_01]: smarter decisions on what you're applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
like I said, the recipes aren't that much
[SPEAKER_01]: different than what tomato farmers and
poinsettia growers are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree 100% with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something I've been pushing as a
platform now for five or six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a talk at CannaCon one year on how
to get off bottled nutrients, where
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially my big push is look at the
ingredient list for starters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see what they're actually claiming on
the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then look and see if this product is
being used outside of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a red flag if it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, if they say there's
anything proprietary about what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, walk the other way, even if it's
the most amazing product in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we're going to grow a plant
that's going to be combusted or it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be consumed as an edible, we need to
know everything we're putting on that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't trust these companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already proven it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been too many stop sales and other
issues around the cannabis industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: we should not be putting our trust in a
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too risky, especially for a
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that you were able to switch
Outco off of a program like that onto one
[SPEAKER_00]: that, in my opinion, is not only more
affordable but a lot more sustainable for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant itself even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so coming from grad school where I did
focus on basically microbes in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and how they can assist, and we're going
to sound like a skeptic here, but at least
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about growers who are growing
hydroponically, one, as we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about fertilizer companies, I question
some of the microbe companies as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically growing hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this makes me think, if we're
applying such high rates of salts,
[SPEAKER_01]: making your EC and your root ball very,
very high, are we actually just adding one
[SPEAKER_01]: problem on top of the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: So your EC is very, very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is this microbe application actually
benefiting the plant because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: applying one more set of watering,
which is actually, it's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbe that's helping the plant in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the dilution of that EC that you
already have in your media that's helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it potentially you have such a high
EC?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know microbes help mainly with
phosphorus and zinc uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it potentially helping you during this
high stress, high salinity environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: as microbes do?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we were smarter about our
fertilizer applications from the get-go,
[SPEAKER_01]: would these microbes be showing the
results that they sometimes do for
[SPEAKER_01]: growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just so I understand this, you're
speculating that what we're doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these microbial applications in an
hydroponic environment due to the salinity
[SPEAKER_00]: is really just putting a bandaid on a
wound that we created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, you could lower your
salinity levels and get your EC down and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe achieve the same results that you're
getting by over-fertilizing and applying
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of brings up another point
that I wanted to touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you and I have had discussions off
air about organics versus chemicals or
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic or mineral salts, whatever you
want to call them, as two different
[SPEAKER_00]: methods for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew up being a hardcore organic
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents were organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I've gotten older and learned more
about this industry, I've kind of opened
[SPEAKER_00]: my mind a little bit towards not so much
organics versus conventional, but more
[SPEAKER_00]: about sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very possible to be organic and
unsustainable in terms of what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding in terms of heavy metal levels and
other issues potentially with organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it is possible to grow more
sustainably using mineral salts and the
[SPEAKER_00]: added benefit from a research perspective
of reducing all the variability that you
[SPEAKER_00]: see in organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be very, very difficult
to perform a study on living soils versus
[SPEAKER_00]: using a hydroponic setup where you can
control all of those aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really only have one variable that
you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you mentioned that growers have
given you a hard time in the past for not
[SPEAKER_00]: using organics as your methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you touch a little bit on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I absolutely believe that sustainable
growing is the answer, especially with not
[SPEAKER_01]: even having the opportunity to be USDA
certified organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many, many scenarios where if you
were combining synthetics and organic
[SPEAKER_01]: methods, that you truly are being more
sustainable than if you were only doing
[SPEAKER_01]: one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about, let's say,
silica and calcium chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're adding a lot of silica and
calcium chloride to your foliar mixture,
[SPEAKER_01]: to your nutrients, you are getting the
benefit of pest control by adding those
[SPEAKER_01]: non-organic inputs and one, having a
better crop because of less insect damage,
[SPEAKER_01]: but two, maybe not applying other
pesticides that could be a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: damaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, overdoing anything is
not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overapplying salts is not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overapplying manure with lots and lots of
water on top of that, that's still a
[SPEAKER_01]: pollutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so combining a lot of these
sustainable methods is absolutely,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my mind, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a downfall to each side,
absolutely, but I think you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: combine them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard not to, specifically in indoor
growing, controlled environment growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not able to reuse your pots or
your soil mixtures or remediate each year
[SPEAKER_01]: your outdoor crop, soil environment,
it's very hard to do only organic methods,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at it from a plant
perspective, I mean, the plant doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: care if the nitrate it's receiving is from
a mineral salt or from a nutrient cycling
[SPEAKER_00]: process where it took something like fish
meal and broke that down into nitrate by
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacteria, archaea, protozoa and
everything, cycling that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the plant, it doesn't really make a
difference, which I think is an important
[SPEAKER_00]: distinction that we discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to be fair, I am a purely organic
person and I see a lot of issues with not
[SPEAKER_00]: just the cannabis industry, but
conventional agriculture around the
[SPEAKER_00]: concept of sustainability, like we
discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also realize that not everyone is
going to make that choice or choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we really want is everyone to be
growing sustainably no matter what
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology they choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that, I think, is what you
mentioned here is moving away from a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these bottle nutrient programs that
have you over applying a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients and figuring out exactly
what the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a lot of growers, that's really
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of them don't have access to
leaf tissue analysis or even basic soil
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one advantage of these bottle
nutrient programs is they give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding chart and they give you a product
and you know you're going to get a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how would you address that for someone
who has less, I guess, less educational
[SPEAKER_00]: background around horticulture and maybe
less access to testing facilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the hemp bill just passing,
I think our opportunity to have leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: sample or leaf analysis done at
universities is going to be here within
[SPEAKER_01]: the next six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's some here at Clemson that
will already do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's specifically leaf samples of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously if you have a cannabis
sample, the leaves aren't going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the secondary metabolites that you might
expect, the same as hemp, but it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, that was a little rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing to realize is that
you're not locked in to only working with
[SPEAKER_01]: the hydra store anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's companies out there that have been
in production for 100 years in agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: that can help you develop a fertilizer
program that is sustainable, that does
[SPEAKER_01]: work for cannabis, and can guide you
through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, in San Diego, there's a
company that I work with called Granjitos.
[SPEAKER_01]: For 50 years plus, they've been working
with avocado growers and other fruit and
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have the capacity to make
whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was able to go to them after
figuring out our recipe from individual
[SPEAKER_01]: salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they made my mixture into a premix
ready to put under the dosatrine slurry
[SPEAKER_01]: where my guys weren't actually mixing the
individual salts themselves, just because
[SPEAKER_01]: they can be human error and that and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did it in bulk, did it in a
concentrated form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was still 23 times less expensive
than the bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that was with me having a
recipe ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these companies, I mean, they already
know what a cannabis plant needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very, this is just in San
Diego, but there's agricultural stores
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere in every state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, these are people that have
been working with plants their whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can help you figure out what your
plant needs, just like Granjitos did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to take away from the
fact that we're still learning a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and about cannabis and what optimal
nutrient levels look like in these crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the research is just starting to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to see a lot in the
next few years, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think we should count on the
fact that the nutrient companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: exist in the cannabis industry have really
figured it out in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what a lot of people
are counting on, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the recipe from General Hydroponics or
from Botanicare is optimized for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's something that we need to
go back and revisit as we learn a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: about this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's change subjects here,
because there's a lot of other things I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk to you about in terms of
aspects around cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that you mentioned to me
was some work you've done around this
[SPEAKER_00]: concept of lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I joined Outco, you know,
they were stripping the bottoms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, at week three, they were
stripping almost all the leaves off the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just, I was so confused why this
was happening and started doing some
[SPEAKER_01]: research and found, you know, okay,
it does make some sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's the same idea of what peach
growers do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they will either spray some
substance or have growers go out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: knock off half of the peaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, they have less quantity,
but their peaches are bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about where are you wanting to
allocate your resources?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that concept,
it made some sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concept of better airflow made sense
for botrytis or powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, I still
struggled with, well, yes, these are
[SPEAKER_01]: photoreceptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are we actually hurting the plant by
doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we lowering our yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had Dr. Mike Jenkins come out
from Rubisco Consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd done some work together before,
but he has an actual LICOR meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this does is measure
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we said, okay, well, let's put some
numbers on all of these theories that
[SPEAKER_01]: growers have and, you know, try to figure
out and understand why certain methods are
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, he spent a couple of days
in the grow room taking measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's actually coming out with a paper
on this, all the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, you'll be able to read shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But long story short, what we found is
that the leaves that are receiving less
[SPEAKER_01]: than 200 micromoles, so the intensity of
200 micromoles, were not photosynthesizing
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiently, basically those lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to give you an idea, you know,
our top leaves were reaching anywhere from
[SPEAKER_01]: 900 to 1100 micromoles, so much,
much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, okay, well, the lower
leaves, they're not doing anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning they are not creating food,
meaning they are a sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: More interesting than that, what we found
was that they were transpiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so being an indoor grow double stack,
you know, one of the things we really
[SPEAKER_01]: struggle with is taking the humidity out
of the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have found with data,
every time we lollipop or even defoliate
[SPEAKER_01]: the lower leaves, it's easier to control
that humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this data point helped us
make sense of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're getting rid of these lower
leaves that are not photosynthesizing that
[SPEAKER_01]: are taking nutrients from the other plants
and are just acting as a sprinkler system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we learned is there is
absolutely sense in lollipopping and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting rid of those leaves that are
receiving less than 200 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, if a grower had a light
meter, they could go around and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: get an idea for what leaves are getting
approximately what light levels in the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then remove anything below that 200
micromole level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did not correlate that with
yield, but for us, it was an important
[SPEAKER_01]: point because we struggle with humidity
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so your research is right now based
around humidity control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't done the correlation with
yield yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about in relation to plant stress or
disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do realize that you're talking
about essentially stressing the plant by
[SPEAKER_00]: removing these leaves in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this plant has absolutely shown to
have positive results and whether that's
[SPEAKER_01]: just positive results from increasing
their metabolite production.
[SPEAKER_01]: From stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if this defolation happens
specifically early on, just in theory,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say there's not a negative effect
on yield, a flower that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when were you removing the leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was at week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be interested to see if other people
do more research around this to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a different time point in the
flowering cycle that might be more
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to see some more research
around stress response, because like you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, cannabis does seem to be highly
adaptable and able to deal with stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is plenty of research in the
plant world showing that stress targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: stress stressors can result in essentially
a better tasting fruit or a better
[SPEAKER_00]: fruiting response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen anything around cannabis
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen any research on that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: On cannabis itself, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have absolutely seen in papers where
water stress, salinity stress can increase
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary metabolites with basil,
but cannabis not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually kind of brings me back
to the fertilizer input.
[SPEAKER_01]: If in general, you're applying well over
the amount of phosphorus and potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: that is needed, think about what a lot of
growers do at weeks five, six and seven is
[SPEAKER_01]: they apply more PK on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so K controls your EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, is it the benefit of
more phosphorus, potassium, or are we
[SPEAKER_01]: applying a stress of salinity by
increasing these to increase potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabinoid content?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting because a lot of
people just make these assumptions that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at it from another
perspective, there are other variables
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be causing the response we're
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that that's why I
think science is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just to change subjects again,
you had mentioned that well, you presented
[SPEAKER_00]: research actually a photo X a couple of
years ago around a lighting study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the lighting study you're
referencing talking about today?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go ahead and describe that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember seeing that research when you
presented it was I thought it was really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually talked about it a little bit
on this podcast before, but I would love
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear hear it in your words,
sort of what you found and what you were
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, again, when I started at
ALCO, you know, one of the rumors that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was hearing was, well, you can't flower
under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, every person I would ask
why was, you know, didn't have a really
[SPEAKER_01]: good answer for me or they tried it once
and it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I do agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't necessarily give an answer off
of one one time trying with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the sort of thing you have to change
some of your growing habits to produce a
[SPEAKER_01]: good crop under.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the blunt fact of it just not working
is just very untrue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Josh Garavak, who was the plant
scientist there at Fluent at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: contacted me and said, hey, do you want to
do some lighting trials together?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's let's see what's happening
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's prove or disprove this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we set up a study with one
cultivar, which, you know, I want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: very honest with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one cultivar and others could act
very differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at different light intensity,
so 400, 600, 800 and 1200 micromoles per
[SPEAKER_01]: meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we also had a HPS at 700
micromoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we looked at different light
intensity, more or less of the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we collected shoot fresh weight,
shoot dry weight, flower dry weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: trim weight and secondary metabolite
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, basically what we found is that,
well, one, yes, you absolutely can flower
[SPEAKER_01]: under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, you know, when you're looking at
this, you have to dig deeper than just
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to look at potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to look at your ROI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what we did in the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so looking at basically pounds
per light, there was a direct comparison
[SPEAKER_01]: or correlation between intensity and
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did receive the highest yield
with the highest wattage and also highest
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD LED at two and a half pounds per
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the lowest obviously was the 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it wasn't enough for myself or
for the owners of the company to just say,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, higher yield, let's go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we had to dig a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to say, all right, well,
if we're considering X amount per light,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we're considering coverage of this
light, how much we're paying in power,
[SPEAKER_01]: which in San Diego was very expensive,
you know, what does this ROI look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, what we found is that
cost of, you know, the amount we were
[SPEAKER_01]: getting per flower minus power,
it's actually the LEDs that were winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was not even considering HVAC or
that thing, which, you know, we talked a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more about later, but that was
one of the biggest issues changing to LEDs
[SPEAKER_01]: was the HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, end of the day,
what we found is that we were making a
[SPEAKER_01]: much greater ROI from the LED lights than
the HPS lights, considering power and also
[SPEAKER_01]: cost of fixture, because that's one of the
biggest problems with LEDs is that their
[SPEAKER_01]: price per fixture is just you know,
comparatively outrageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking at 800, I'm sorry,
a 660 watt LED, you're looking at 1200
[SPEAKER_01]: bucks, maybe higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS, you could probably get it under $400.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, especially when you're
first designing a room, you have to think,
[SPEAKER_01]: is this worth it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in our study, what we showed was
that, you know, under one year,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're able to pay back that investment
simply because of the power savings plus
[SPEAKER_01]: increase of yield plus increase of
secondary metabolites, which was minimal,
[SPEAKER_01]: but was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that was really big for
ALCO was that because of some of the local
[SPEAKER_01]: laws, we were not able to expand like we
had planned to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were limited in space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did have really high ceilings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because they're LEDs, you're able
to stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were able to immediately say,
all right, well, we can flower under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to also increase our footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we partnered with PIP and,
you know, almost immediately doubled our
[SPEAKER_01]: footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, you know, that's great and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It increased our overall yield by 2.8
times, but, you know, it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were other things we had to work
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so being one of the first that
upgraded to the double stack, we had to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out, all right, well, how do you
get water up to the top?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you able to move these benches
with getting water to them?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you move the air within these
canopies?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there were a lot of tricks we had
to figure out that was fun, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: frustrating at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we expected,
maybe not as much as it ended up being,
[SPEAKER_01]: was the humidity control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, because they are LEDs,
our cooling was enough, but the humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: removal was not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you have twice as many
plants, you have twice as much
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration, and so you have to remove
twice as much water from the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we absolutely had to increase our
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that I would just suggest
all growers do when they're using LEDs is
[SPEAKER_01]: think about, you know, even though the
temperature in the room might be the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: that does not mean that the leaves
temperature is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would highly encourage to get an
infrared sensor to look at leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to HBS, which does have a lot of
radiant heating, the leaf temperature can
[SPEAKER_01]: be up to five degrees cooler under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you have high humidity and you
have much cooler leaf temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a special sauce for botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, increasing room
temperature as well is something that we
[SPEAKER_01]: had to ultimately end up doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, the solution was to increase the
room temperature to address the lower leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature relative to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to go back a little bit on
this, the study that you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to clarify for listeners,
it was one cultivar and under a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different light intensity, and you were
looking at ROI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So return on investment for people who
aren't familiar with that term.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially what you found was that
the 1200 micromoles was not the most
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had the highest yield, but relative to
the amount of cost associated with running
[SPEAKER_00]: your electricity that high, I believe you
found 1000 was optimal for your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that, has that changed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost, almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 1200 PPFD fixture, which was the
thousand watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was actually just a prototype to
achieve PPFD that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when considering the extra power input
and then the yield and potency,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was actually the 800 PPFD, not an
average, of course, but the 660 watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the SpiderX that was optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to vary in terms of ROI
based on your cost of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in a different area where
electricity costs a lot less or loss a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more, you may find that that number may
change a little bit, which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: something to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's, we have kind of a wide
variety of topics here that I have listed
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we move on to curing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so curing is something that I've
especially became interested in because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think even more than chemistry or
cultivation, it's been a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: ignored.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in terms of an art,
it's been figured out quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of what's actually going on,
I don't think we know very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, this really isn't my area
of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be curious to hear what you have to
say around, around curing or what you
[SPEAKER_00]: found out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Marcus Rogan and I tagged team this
because it is a combination of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: science, biochemistry, and then of course,
just chemistry in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a good time trying to guess
what's going on and then comparing it to
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the industry guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is drying and curing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so drying, of course, we have to do it
to prevent spoilage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Curing, though, you know, when you stick
it in the bucket, what is that and why do
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we set forth trying to search the
literature, search other plants and figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out what might be going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we're comparing it,
let's think, all right, well, fruits and
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they are plants that are picked
and stored for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut flowers, maybe even more so relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're picked and they're stored and the
science behind that is just out of this
[SPEAKER_01]: world compared to what cannabis has right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the transportation of
unrooted cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of just fruits, veggies and
flowers that are meant to basically just
[SPEAKER_01]: be put to pause, and then killed,
the transportation of unrooted cuttings is
[SPEAKER_01]: a pause, but then a continuation of
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so looking through all of this
literature, you know, the big things we
[SPEAKER_01]: see are, all right, well, we're trying to
delay death.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to preserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to delay ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in our case, do we want to speed up
ripening?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and how's this done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cool temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inhibition of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think ethylene has been very much
understudied in cannabis because it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a ripening agent that every
other industry struggles with to remove or
[SPEAKER_01]: in case of ripening fruit, maybe even use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, we have to think,
all right, well, it's not just this one
[SPEAKER_01]: organism, cannabis that we're working
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's others that like to creep in.
[SPEAKER_01]: At certain optimum temperatures and
humidities as well, such as botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked into, you know, what's going
on in the industry right now, anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: from 60 to 45 Fahrenheit for drying and 40
to 60 for humidity is about standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, we wondered,
well, and this was, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: at the beginning, you know, how do you
decide it's time to pull a plant from the
[SPEAKER_01]: dryer to go into cure?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when I started,
the answers I was getting was,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, there's a crack in the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, I was very confused how
that the metric that we're using is a
[SPEAKER_01]: crack because I wasn't familiar with what
that crack was supposed to sound like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't sure how I was going to write
an SOP for other employees to be able to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, make sure we're pulling the
plant down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the right time, but crack sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, looking into what people
in coffee, what's, you know, drying,
[SPEAKER_01]: roasting coffee, looking into,
let's say beef jerky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all of those are food items that
have to be dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's a known stopping
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what is that device used for knowing
when it's time to stop drying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's called a water activity
meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this is not the actual moisture
content of a food item.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the actual available water for
microbial growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if you look through the
literature, there are set water activity
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers that will tell you, all right,
well, this species strain of bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast, and mold will not grow under the
certain water activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we purchased a water activity meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is how we now determine when it's
actually time to pull the plants from the
[SPEAKER_01]: room and to go to cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, from that and from looking at the
literature where it is shown that botrytis
[SPEAKER_01]: will not grow under a water activity of
.8, we can be very comfortable with drying
[SPEAKER_01]: fast enough for botrytis and other
microbes not to grow, but also slow enough
[SPEAKER_01]: where all of these enzymatic activities,
which we don't actually know which ones
[SPEAKER_01]: are happening now, but we can postulate
that it's the conversion of starch to
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar, the breakdown of chlorophyll,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we can have the water activity high
enough to continue these enzymatic
[SPEAKER_01]: activities, but low enough to not grow
botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I wish I had the graph in front of
you, but basically what we do is from day
[SPEAKER_01]: one to three, we drop the water activity
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, down to .8.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, botrytis is not growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, it's a slow dry until 12 to 14
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, it's dropped down to about
.6, which is consumer preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in between, you're still at high
enough water activity to where a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these enzymatic processes can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be the most interesting
science-related cannabis thing I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that has been shared on this podcast to
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that someone could take a concept
that's been more art than science really
[SPEAKER_00]: around curing and set a quantifiable point
using a meter so that growers can know
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly when to harvest something,
or essentially how you should be drying
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, anything else around curing that you
would touch on that you found by using
[SPEAKER_00]: this method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, once we were comfortable with our
drying procedures, we just wanted to know
[SPEAKER_01]: what was happening in the cure,
in the bucket, and what the heck was a
[SPEAKER_01]: burden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we set up an experiment with Nate
Controls and Legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually made a small data logger,
which measured CO2, relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, we were able to put these into
five gallon buckets, just the regular old
[SPEAKER_01]: food grade plastic ones that I would say
most people use for curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this was a bucket that was kept
for two weeks with no burping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it just stayed closed the entire time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had what we called the out-coat burp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this was for the first three days,
the lids were removed for about 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: for our turn, and then returned to their
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the industry burp, where we took
the lid off daily for an hour and turned
[SPEAKER_01]: the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, we were able to graphically see
what was happening with these different
[SPEAKER_01]: metrics we looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, looking at CO2, what we found is that
in general over these two weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, somehow it's being produced within
the bucket, no matter the type of burp.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing that was interesting is
that you zoom in to one specific day
[SPEAKER_01]: within those two weeks, no matter the burp
style, what you're seeing is a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease in CO2 after the burp,
which makes sense, and then a very fast
[SPEAKER_01]: increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, when we looked at the time,
of when all this was happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, the burp would happen about 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: when people would come in to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just keep in mind that these
containers were kept in a room where the
[SPEAKER_01]: trimming was happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there were a lot of people coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the CO2 would increase until about
five when everyone got off work,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it would slowly decrease when
they left work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we saw that obviously the CO2 that the
humans are producing is causing the
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the buckets are not gas-tight,
at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just the amount of humans in the room
was raising the CO2 in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what kind of, I guess, generalizations
can you make based on your findings here,
[SPEAKER_00]: if any?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was very surprising, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, these plants at such a
low water activity, I just couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine any sort of respirations
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any sort of fermentation
happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've discussed this with quite a number of
folks, and it's still very confusing
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on, but at least having some
data, a little bit of insight of what
[SPEAKER_01]: might be going on is a good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many follow-ups to
these experiments we need to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, that was just interesting to see
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, looking next at relative
humidity, because one of the answers I
[SPEAKER_01]: would always get with what's happening in
the cure is, oh, it's releasing moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean, releasing moisture?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this was regardless of the type of
burp, minus the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the alcoh burp and the
industry burp.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would happen is, you know,
when it's closed, it's a very stagnant
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that about 50% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, when the burp happened,
the humidity would increase or decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this would happen in correlation to
what was happening in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if the room had 30% humidity and we
did a burp, it would drop for about 30
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes to about 50% humidity and then go
back to exactly where it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the same with the inverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was very humid in the room,
it would pop up very quickly during the
[SPEAKER_01]: burp and then go back to where it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there is no per se release of
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's accumulating whatever's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or not accumulating, but it's acclimating
to whatever's happening in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the only thing we truly proved
in this study, we did have interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: findings, but the only thing I think we
truly found was that the cure is a
[SPEAKER_01]: homogenization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, the buds dry from the outside in,
meaning that the outside of the buds lose
[SPEAKER_01]: their moisture first and then eventually
it comes out the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this was proven by at the
beginning of curing, taking lots of water
[SPEAKER_01]: activity samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we saw was there was huge
variance between the samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this makes sense because there's big
bugs, big buds, small buds, all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had very different water
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once two weeks passed, we took this water
activity samples again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, what we found was two interesting
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One being the variance was much smaller,
meaning whether it was a small bud or a
[SPEAKER_01]: big bud, they were very similar in water
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that was interesting is
that overall, the water activity
[SPEAKER_01]: increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this doesn't mean that the buds
were getting more wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This means that the moisture that was
inside or the moisture that was within the
[SPEAKER_01]: deep crevices of the big bud was going to
the small bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all having a very similar
water activity moisture content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it was homogenizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, by putting it into a bucket or
container like that, you're allowing all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the moisture in all the buds to sort of
homogenize, is sort of what you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there is an advantage to putting in
these buckets to homogenize the moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you couldn't draw any conclusions
regarding to burping in terms of it being
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: No conclusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know there is a wild exchange of
gases.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have an ethylene sensor,
but it was borrowed and it was not working
[SPEAKER_01]: very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I really wanted to measure the
ethylene that was being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't able to correlate it,
but I can conclude that the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylene was just out of this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never seen numbers that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I can't tell you if that's good
and we want to increase ethylene or if we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to decrease it, but I can tell you
it's there and it's very, very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so much more research needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was just kind of a first stab of
just trying to see what's happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like I said, lots more to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I never really have thought about
cannabis in relation to ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think of ethylene, I think of
bananas or apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you mentioned, how we use
ethylene or try and modulate ethylene in
[SPEAKER_00]: those industries, because it does have
such a ripening effect on fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, essentially, what you're getting at is
that we don't know if ethylene is good or
[SPEAKER_00]: bad or if the burping by lowering the
ethylene is going to improve the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cure or we want to not burp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burp at all and raise ethylene levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would speculate that we're removing the
ethylene when you burp and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially beneficial just based on what
the industry has sort of anecdotally moved
[SPEAKER_00]: towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really don't know, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we really don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it a good thing and is it helping to
speed up the ripening process,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you know, is that is that making the
buds sweeter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that getting rid of the chlorophyll
where it's not so grassy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really can't say, but I think it needs
to be investigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't wait to see more research on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on from curing, the last topic I
wanted to cover really quick was sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: this concept around myths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we've kind of touched on a few
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there anything else that you've
seen, you know, coming out of your,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, having this degree, coming into
the cannabis industry with your
[SPEAKER_00]: background?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else you're noticing
that really stood out to you as sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a crazy methodology or anything
that we're doing in this industry that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just that's just really unique or
different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, a lot of it always goes
back to fertilizer for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the concept of flushing, that's one
I'm still questioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the only research I've seen put
out is from, I can't remember the name,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was from a master's degree dissertation
in Canada, where they were looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: flushing, but all they really measured was
the amount of nutrients within the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so not not form of nutrients,
but just elementals, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they found is that with
flushing, whether it's one week,
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks, that there was no decreasing
elements, which makes complete sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, you hear, oh,
you're flushing, you're flushing the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not even possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might manipulate the form that the
nutrient is in, but you're not just going
[SPEAKER_01]: to remove parts that have developed into
the cells of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that that study showed that,
no, you're not removing nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't mean that you're not that
restricting nutrients is not changing
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially, you know, the form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you're not speeding up some of
those post-harvest processes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, maybe if if you are causing
nutrient deficiency, then maybe the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: thinks it's time to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's speeding up some of
these ripening procedures like the starch
[SPEAKER_01]: to sugar or chlorophyll degradation that
could, in fact, yield a better quality
[SPEAKER_01]: post-harvest flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, is flushing beneficial
because we are over fertilizing the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually a break for the
plants to, you know, to not be,
[SPEAKER_01]: to not have salinity stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually an opposite stress very
quickly done to the plant two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any of those answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I get frustrated when
people just generally say, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting rid of the nutrients in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just, it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got to strive to ask more
questions and not be stuck on just
[SPEAKER_01]: carrying around the myth that,
you know, other growers have said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's okay to say we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's okay to try these things on
our own and figure it out together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially it's very well established
that you're not removing nutrients from
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant when you flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just basic plant science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But possibly by removing the nutrients
from the media, we may be like speeding up
[SPEAKER_00]: senescence or creating a stress response
that allows for potentially altering the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality or quantity of our final crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else around the myths that you
wanted to discuss or other concepts that
[SPEAKER_00]: you found don't just, just haven't played
out in real life?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think we covered them mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main ones that I have in mind and
that, you know, I've been able to touch on
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow through research, even if it's,
you know, again, no conclusions,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at least a start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cannabis has done a great job,
you know, conducting growing and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: things without being able to go to your
extension agent or, you know, take a
[SPEAKER_01]: class.
