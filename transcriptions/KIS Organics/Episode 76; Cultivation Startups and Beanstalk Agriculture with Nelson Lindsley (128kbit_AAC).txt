[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest today is Nelson Linsley of
Poetry of Plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check him out on Instagram under
Poetry of Plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nelson has been cultivating cannabis for
over a decade and working in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: for over two decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: An artist by heart and an innovator by
trade, he has worked with a majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: leading grow room technology and
techniques that are available on the
[SPEAKER_00]: current market and studied their
application for efficient large-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the past three years, he has
consulted on cultivation sites in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, Oregon, Colorado,
Pennsylvania, and California.
[SPEAKER_00]: After working with Nelson, we have added a
couple of products to our product line at
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have lighting from science LEDs as
well as offering beanstalk new nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I put a lot of thought and
consideration into carrying this brand
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not an organic nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I'm an organic gardener myself,
I realize that there are many folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to offer what I believe to be
one of the most sustainable chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: options for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we discussed some of those reasons in
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to try beanstalk after
listening to this podcast, you can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% discount with free shipping on our
website or by entering the coupon code KIS
[SPEAKER_00]: on their website page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This promotion will be in effect for the
next three weeks from the podcast launch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a larger facility,
we do have access to bulk pricing and
[SPEAKER_00]: options along that route too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, on with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Nelson, thanks for coming back on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Todd.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we haven't talked on air in a
fair while now, but you've been a popular
[SPEAKER_00]: guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to fill in listeners on kind
of what you've been up to?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they all kind of know your
background a little bit already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's been going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last year I've been working on
getting a roughly 30,000 square feet
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor canopy up in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania with a company called MyTree
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been about 80% of my focus as far
as things on the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working, so that's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, I've been working with a
lighting company called Science Lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: doing some grow trials with their spectrum
controllable lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And number three, I've been working on
getting visibility for beanstalk
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture, which is a control release
fertilizer that I was a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: co-developing and bringing to market with
a few other great guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've been really busy is what I'm
hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to talk about all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we start off talking a little
bit about your experience with this
[SPEAKER_00]: facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it like setting up a new facility
in what it sounds like a fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging state?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to just touch on that a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, startup is really
challenging because you're building
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how we're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're building something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not operating necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when you're starting up operations,
you're still in building mode,
[SPEAKER_01]: dialing things in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of liken it to building a guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you have the guitar built,
you put strings on it and then you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: tune the strings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in the tuning the strings mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did things a little bit differently
with this company as we started out with a
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were required to do that by the state
that they have some funding rules where
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to once you get your occupancy
permit, you have to have a harvest within
[SPEAKER_01]: six months, which doesn't factor in all
the things that go into building things
[SPEAKER_01]: out and getting everything kind of ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we staged it in a few phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last year, right before COVID hit,
we started this phase one grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is about a thousand square feet of
canopy where we did a bunch of seed
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting while we were cleaning up all of
our genetics and tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_01]: testing everything, make sure it didn't
have a viroid or bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of preliminary work on the tissue
culture plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just started with a bunch of seeds
from compound and canorado and then hunted
[SPEAKER_01]: those out, did a couple of drops and
trained the core team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And COVID hit and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just, essentially everybody here
became like an extension of my family
[SPEAKER_01]: because we were existing and living in a
bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've spent majority of the time
out here, not at home because travel has
[SPEAKER_01]: been tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last four to five months,
and this is all the building and the
[SPEAKER_01]: construction was happening for the first
six larger flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as of last month, we got those
flower rooms up and going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's challenging enough to get
everything operational on a timeline that
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody sets up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even harder when things go wrong and
you've got incredibly long lead times now
[SPEAKER_01]: because some of these parts come from
China, some of them are coming from all
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had to become very creative on
getting to this point with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges with supply chain, with
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a lot of fluid movement and
pivoting and in hiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've created around 40 new jobs in
Pittsburgh with this startup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then going through training and
educating a lot of non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced individuals, kind of bringing
them into the fold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been great for me because I've
been doing this for a little bit and
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to an area like, Pittsburgh and
working with a great company that's
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on hiring diverse individuals,
trying to create a male-female balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: 50-50 in the garden and across the entire
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great to come into this company
with that kind of thought process and
[SPEAKER_01]: mission statement to be inclusive in their
hiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also be in a community that can't
do anything about it.
So it's been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis has not been, it's been
tightly regulated for the last two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only been legal medically,
but it did not have 20 years of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: like California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for everybody here, it's really new and
really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been really refreshing to
participate in that excitement and how
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting it is for all these people here
to be able to work with this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been probably the most fun I've had
with the full process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of it, long and the short
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's challenging, but rewarding is
the best way of putting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize, a project of this scope is
probably more than we can really dive into
[SPEAKER_00]: too much on the podcast, but are there any
highlights or things that you would,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking back like things you wish you'd
known at the onset that you could maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: pass on in terms of advice or information
to a listener that's more broad possibly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that the number one thing in
having a successful startup is having open
[SPEAKER_01]: communication on all levels of your staff
and management.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that anywhere that we've had a
failure has been because we haven't been
[SPEAKER_01]: communicating effectively and creating
those paths of communication where it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a hierarchy as far as
responsibility goes, but we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to create an open forum for anybody
to kind of communicate when they catch
[SPEAKER_01]: something or something doesn't seem right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that can become challenging also
when you're working with third parties
[SPEAKER_01]: like contractors or consultants or things
like that, where they're not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: as open internally as you would be if
you're within the same company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just communicate when things are coming
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that also highlights why your core
team has to be really in a high level of
[SPEAKER_01]: communication about every little detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's ways of doing that without
having to have a thousand meetings because
[SPEAKER_01]: meetings can take up your entire day and
then you're just burned out and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to move into action.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're already kind of gone through all
the brain damage of like five meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've set up a lot of, we've got a
handful of social media apps that we use
[SPEAKER_01]: for our communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have just systems that we set up
for communicating all the little details
[SPEAKER_01]: that are coming up, all the little
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say that that's the biggest
challenge is just getting everybody on the
[SPEAKER_01]: same page because you're gonna have
unknown challenges that pop up getting
[SPEAKER_01]: things commissioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the commissioning process in case you
don't know is you've got the facility
[SPEAKER_01]: built and then you have to go into turning
on all these systems and ensuring that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're meeting your set point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a cultivator setting up a
facility, what you have to provide the
[SPEAKER_01]: engineers is your environmental set
points, how much water is going in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room, all of these things that the people
that are programming your environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: controls and if you have a chiller plant,
something like that, you have to program
[SPEAKER_01]: in how that chiller plant's gonna operate
based on your desired set points in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to provide all this
information and you have to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all working right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with all the challenges, sometimes you
don't get to have all of that time to do
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that testing and certain milestones
are kind of overlapping others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're trying to do multiple
things at one time, it's really important
[SPEAKER_01]: that you just over communicate with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been probably the biggest
lesson that I've learned is just to
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly communicate, try not to
micromanage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've kind of dissolved the hierarchy
approach as far as how information gets to
[SPEAKER_01]: the owners of the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've created channels for anybody to
bring things up as needed as we're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: things started up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I think that communications,
the biggest thing, especially challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: too for people who really are growers and
are used to growing around plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that don't talk back, pass on
emotions and have life experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for us, shrinking the business down
was actually the best thing we ever could
[SPEAKER_00]: have done from a stress perspective,
from a communication perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I talk to everyone in our company
right now every day, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's little, but we only meet
once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that's enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think I totally agree with you
that communication is key because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not all on the same page,
it's nearly impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the scope of the project grows to
really be successful or get anything done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've been doing in the past is
consulting or having my own garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a couple of guys that I work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having to be responsible for the
coordination of so many people,
[SPEAKER_01]: so many more people, really requires
having dialogue and really connecting with
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look at it as the staff here is
watering the garden metaphorically and
[SPEAKER_01]: literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm here to water their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is I'm here to
help support them, find purpose,
[SPEAKER_01]: find their own skill set, find their own
leadership so they can improve their
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's looking at not to minimize human
beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always kind of comparing everything to
the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a different skill set that I'm
learning that really has to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating relationships, cultivating
communication and helping people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in that are younger, that want to
be in the cannabis space, that are hungry
[SPEAKER_01]: for that, they're excited to be a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really helping support them in their
journey in this space and doing it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: way where it's an awesome path forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've seen a lot of gardeners and a
lot of grows where people are just burned
[SPEAKER_01]: out and not happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's always going to reflect
in the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the issues with scale is that
there's a lot of big gardens with a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of unhappy people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're trying to do here is we're
trying to figure out how to scale the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden and create wellness with people
where people love coming to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get to experience the joy of working
in the garden every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what I think we're
creating here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had the support of this company
to create something that I've hoped would
[SPEAKER_01]: emerge out of this space, whereas it's
really been kind of a bumpy initial road.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think culturally and I think
business-wise, and I think part of that is
[SPEAKER_01]: because the focus, the target has been
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been about profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't been about quality of life
people or quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that in the long term and
probably in the short term, shifting the
[SPEAKER_01]: focus away from just short-term gains and
into creating just an epic place to be and
[SPEAKER_01]: work and do good things and create quality
products is going to pay more dividends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then trying to come in, inflate your
value and run that whole kind of game with
[SPEAKER_01]: the stock market and everything else,
we're kind of starting to see get exposed
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's been present in the cannabis
industry for the last eight years where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just been pretty awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really rolls downhill to the
employees and they feel that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with MyTree, we're trying to do
something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got great mentors here that are
teaching me about how to be a better
[SPEAKER_01]: people person and a better leader and
leading from the heart and leading from
[SPEAKER_01]: communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool to see that in an actual
company in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: to say the very least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know for us, that's been the
biggest challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slack's been a really cool tool for us to
use in terms of- That's what we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, having these different channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we even have a random channel
where right now we're discussing what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on with Reddit and the stock market
and talking about things along those lines
[SPEAKER_00]: or current events, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's optional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone has to participate,
but it's a way to connect when we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: so disconnected right now with COVID going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have other channels that are
around what's going on with research,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on around sales or customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that if we have a customer issue,
we can put it up in there right away and
[SPEAKER_00]: we can all address it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I realize for a cultivation team,
that's a little bit different in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: what channels make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been a great tool for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you said you're using
Slack to, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I'm sure people are going to
be curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the software or the apps that we found
that work the best is Slack for all the
[SPEAKER_01]: communication, and then Mondays for the
scheduling and project management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can populate changes in Mondays
into Slack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mondays as a module for Slack,
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I go in, and Slack is really
intuitive, easy to use project management
[SPEAKER_01]: software that's colorful and intuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of looks like a kids app,
but it has a lot of functionality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easy for anybody to kind of jump
in and be able to see where everything's
[SPEAKER_01]: at.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different viewing modes
from just a basic project overview to
[SPEAKER_01]: calendars and timeline and Gantt charts,
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you are making adjustments
to the schedule, even if you're in a task
[SPEAKER_01]: and you get stuck or it's completed or get
auto populated to the Slack channel,
[SPEAKER_01]: that correlates to that Monday Monday's
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I basically set up different project
boards for each room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those will auto populate to the
channel that we have on Slack that's
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated to the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we organize it, we organize our Slack
and our Mondays based off of spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have management channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody that has activities or
objectives in those spaces will have
[SPEAKER_01]: access to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have like a scouting channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course we have a meme channel so
the staff can meme each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked the staff to, right now I'd
say there's one employee that we have that
[SPEAKER_01]: has like topped my memes, but we have like
a friendly meme challenge where we'll meme
[SPEAKER_01]: each other and it keeps everything kind of
lighthearted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't take yourself too seriously when
you're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole part of this is for us to enjoy
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we create that place where people will
be creative and kind of walk the line per
[SPEAKER_01]: se, which is kind of what I do all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where you and Miami Mango are
getting all your ammo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this meme channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I want to add to this is,
you know, if you are cultivating on it
[SPEAKER_00]: with a team of growers and you are in a
position, a leadership position,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the two biggest things I found
that helped me are kind of really obvious,
[SPEAKER_00]: but giving people a sense of purpose and a
sense of ownership are the two things that
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a really made a difference because
as your scope of company or cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: expands, you can't do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be the one watering the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to give people not only the
structure and tools and the SOPs to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: well and do it the way it should be done,
but also the ownership and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense of value in what they're doing
to where they'll want to speak up and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll want to do a good job and realize
that their part in this company is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to throw that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know that I'm 100% with you on it
and that, you know, ownership and purpose,
[SPEAKER_01]: those two things work hand in hand and
that's got to carry all the way through
[SPEAKER_01]: and the company has to have that
commitment to the staff and the employees
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would add one thing is I find a lot of
companies, especially in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're always chasing yield numbers,
cannabinoid percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those are results and what I've
learned is if you chase results,
[SPEAKER_01]: you tend to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you chase information, results
follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your communication is solid,
you'll be able to have access to all the
[SPEAKER_01]: information that will end up leading to
the results that you desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're constantly chasing results
and not collecting the data and the
[SPEAKER_01]: information, that's typically where all
the mistakes occur and where the failures
[SPEAKER_01]: occur as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good segue off of the
facility stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to I want to save some time
to talk about nutrients, specifically what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing around with beanstalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk a little about what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to talk to you because you guys
are growing using, you know, essentially a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and I have had long winded
discussions about the merits and
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability of chemicals versus organic
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked a little bit about actually
last podcast I just put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today on with Carrie, Dr. Carrie Peters
about, you know, the differences there,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would love for us to just spend like
maybe five, 10 minutes just touching a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit on that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've met Carrie.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spoken to her a bunch, met her at a
convention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Peters is a great company and I've
used their products a whole lot in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a little of the background on
beanstalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2016, 2017, I was introduced to a few
individuals that were trying to get this
[SPEAKER_01]: product off the ground, which is a
controlled release fertilizer that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit unique in its coating.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same technology that they developed
that this company behind the scenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: these chemists developed for the NASA
Space International Space Station and the
[SPEAKER_01]: NASA Food Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took them about 10 years to get
approved for NASA, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a long path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not anybody can just kind of jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why it's unique is it's
it's really geared towards efficiency and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not having an excess in waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought I thought I was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was interested in the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't really sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't really confident that it would
work for cannabis because I'm so used to
[SPEAKER_01]: creating a cocktail of different organic
and chemical fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I gave it I gave it a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built a small room in my garage like an
eight lighter and then did did a few
[SPEAKER_01]: trials with different control groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And overall, the fertilizer beat out
everything as far as yield quality and
[SPEAKER_01]: growth rate morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I I went to the people behind the
company, which ended up becoming beanstalk
[SPEAKER_01]: was called something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today I'm really interested in being a
part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it can help improve where this
fertilizer is at and and bring it and
[SPEAKER_01]: bring it to the next level and help bring
it to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, the fertilizer is a
prill, which looks like nerds like the
[SPEAKER_01]: candy nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people call them space nerds,
which I think is a cool name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that prill is a polyolefin coating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the minerals are on the inside of that
prill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a single layer coating,
whereas other time release for oligos,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a little difference between
control release and time release.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time release can have upwards of 15 to 20
layers of polyurethane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polyurethane half life is very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polyolefins is a fraction of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's certain fungi and mushrooms
that will degrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you add that into the compost pile,
it'll chew up that polyolefin coating and
[SPEAKER_01]: use it as food with zero with zero impact
to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's there's processes in place
where you can completely remove any of
[SPEAKER_01]: that coating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, after it's been used,
the thought behind it is that what we put
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant is what the plant uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how it works is when moisture or water
hits that membrane, that membrane of the
[SPEAKER_01]: prill, the polyolefin coating through
osmosis, it will pull out the mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: salts and feed it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as time goes by, different pores open
up in that coating, allowing for more
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals to come through at different
rates based on how the fertilizer is
[SPEAKER_01]: formulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's essentially the thought behind
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also to remediate, you know,
the majority of your leachate or runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a small container, so containers
that are large, smaller than seven
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons, I've been able to irrigate with
zero runoff and have successful results.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using larger containers,
you probably still will need to purge the
[SPEAKER_01]: media once in a while to reset it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a little bit better than or a lot
better than, you know, running on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, straight water soluble
fertilizer and having to get five to 10
[SPEAKER_01]: percent runoff every feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go to areas like Central Valley
in California, you know, the the PPM
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of the tap there is extremely
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that has to do with or from
the well water, a lot of it has to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: just so much runoff going into the going
into the the water table.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, two thousand parts per
million, a lot of nitrate, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thought is that not everybody is
going to switch over to organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic doesn't work in all circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, here in Pennsylvania,
Pennsylvania is so tightly regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had to cut out all of my organic
inputs for the most part because they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't differentiate between beneficial and
pathogenic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a very tight aerobic bacteria
count, you know, fungi, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it all bold, even if it's a
beneficial fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in an extremely tightly regulated
environment and using organics is
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might be in a circumstance or
situation where you have to pass testing
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have to try and keep it as clean
as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might involve limiting organic
inputs or, you know, really being careful
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, with some of the issues we're seeing
with kelp and and animal waste having high
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of heavy metals and arsenic,
which I've run into, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the organic inputs might be, you know,
might have different levels of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, you know, I'm looking at it
as, OK, well, most farms I go to are not
[SPEAKER_01]: growing organically, you know,
that I've consulted or work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are running some kind of
assault.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make that paradigm?
[SPEAKER_01]: More sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we reduce that waste?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when this product landed in my lap,
I really liked that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if it didn't grow good weed,
then why would I ever use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it got to go back to the drawing
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the end, you know, we've we released
product that's been out for about a year
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a slow start because it's a new
technology and people sometimes are
[SPEAKER_01]: confused on how simple it is, which you're
just mixing this pearl into the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially feeding water, whatever
organic bio-stimulant you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can you can extract certain other
things on it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just basically going to give you your
fundamental nutrition for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's confusing to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was confusing to me when I first was
trialing it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had a lot of early adopters with
a lot of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you run, you know, five hundred
thousand square feet of canopy on it with
[SPEAKER_01]: one client.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was extremely successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they they've they've kept using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people that have switched over
have just been really impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can add whatever you want on
top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't stay away from any additional
nitrogen because there's all the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: you need and you wouldn't want to add any
more late in the flower, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, we're having great results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're testing extremely high on the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look at the mitre
genetics flower that just dropped or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, between 28 and 32 percent of the
cannabinoids with three and a half,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, anywhere from two point eight to
three and a half percent terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great, great results there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of that has to do with
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't have the proper nutrition
or the proper environment, you might not
[SPEAKER_01]: see that expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything's really doing its job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's producing a flower that's desirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty stoked on the product and
the future of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, to jump in here,
obviously, I'm the organic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been organic my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eat organic food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I've never grown using
chemical nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really my world, but I want to be
pragmatic about this and realize,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said, that I don't know what
percentage of growers are using chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suspect it's a higher percentage
than those using organic nutrients still,
[SPEAKER_00]: though organics has made a huge push,
I think, in the last decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just this is all anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any numbers here,
but that's just sort of what I've seen on
[SPEAKER_00]: my side of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll continue to be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not that organic advocate,
but I want to realize that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to grow using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this is not going away,
how can we be more sustainable about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think companies like Jax,
ideas like Beanstalk are really great in
[SPEAKER_00]: that aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to further those
technologies, further that information,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we're reducing runoff,
reducing water usage, potentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really simplifying things for growers
so that we can get better quality product
[SPEAKER_00]: out there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, I root for the little guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any more general hydroponics
and scots and big ag taking over our
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these small companies or smaller
companies, I guess, are really where I
[SPEAKER_00]: would throw my hat in on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing I wanted to mention for
people who are not
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in cannabis, is that I'm in
either camp, as far as what I would
[SPEAKER_01]: prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really look at it as what's going to
work the best for that scenario and the
[SPEAKER_01]: best for the goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love organically grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try and eat as much organically
grown produce and food as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really what it is, is we have these
containers we have to operate in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the containers are like the rules,
the regulations, the limitations of the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, and then also scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scale is another container that in
general, I don't feel like the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry has really figured out yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting there, but we usually hit a
point where the quality dramatically drops
[SPEAKER_01]: after a specific amount of square feet of
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how to get to that next level so you
can figure out all those problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: part of that just involves simplifying
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just find that sometimes I run into
issues or organic inputs have brought in
[SPEAKER_01]: another layer of complexity that makes the
other aspects of scaling really
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do know that there are people
working on that right now and focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might be in a market where they
have margins where they can afford to take
[SPEAKER_01]: that chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just not everybody is in that position.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love seeing what people are doing
with organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, some of the best cannabis
I've ever smoked has been organically
[SPEAKER_01]: grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people agree with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I just wanted to say that I'm
for organic 100%, but I'm also for the
[SPEAKER_01]: transitioning and in sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that means not necessarily
picking a side, but really looking at how
[SPEAKER_01]: do we progress further away from things
that are so wasteful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the organic industry has
its dark side too, which we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: actually last podcast with Kerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not perfect either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the mined products,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think taking advantage of some of the
native populations around harvesting of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these things, whether it's guanos
or cocoa core, things like that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to consider when we look at
environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, nitrate is
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to recognize that from a plant
physiology perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an organic grower, I have to realize
that the plant honestly can't tell a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference on where that's coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a hard lesson or a hard
answer that we don't necessarily want to
[SPEAKER_00]: accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to think that organics is special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I think organics is special is
in the sense that I don't think that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have completely mastered what microbiology
brings to the table, what soil brings to
[SPEAKER_00]: the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea that we can grow a perfect plant
with a limited number of chemical inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that we ever will be
there, because it is so complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I think organics has a
slight edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are adding complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things we talked about with
Kerry was that research that's being done
[SPEAKER_00]: right now is all being done with chemical
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is easier to control for
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the scientific methods so much
simpler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really hard to get good
organic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to get replicable organic
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every soil is going to be a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definite advantages to using
mineral salts or chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to acknowledge that,
even if that's not my path.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if, on my path, I can help encourage
people to grow more sustainably,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it is with chemical nutrients,
then I'm on board for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was going to get at, though,
was regards to beanstalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This controlled release fertilizer,
for people who aren't as familiar with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as someone who's owned a nursery,
we'd get plants in with Osmocote in there
[SPEAKER_00]: that has these little bluish green balls
that slowly break down over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize that what you're saying here,
time release is different than control
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to give you a visual of the
concept behind it, I thought that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: useful for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the space nerds comes from,
because they look leather.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like tiny little balls or little
malformed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say the big difference which also
reflects on the price between Osmocote and
[SPEAKER_01]: beanstalk is the type of coating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a single layer higher quality
coating with the beanstalk, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the same technology that they use
for NASA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is that the polyurethane is
in its ... There's other issues with the
[SPEAKER_01]: polyurethane.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ... Temperature affects the
release rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found is with the
polyurethane, if you have a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature fluctuation, the fertility can
dump out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the polyolefin coating is going to be
more stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just overall just a higher
quality product from a chemistry level,
[SPEAKER_01]: without having ... The polyurethane is
going to essentially break down into
[SPEAKER_01]: microplastics, which is a problem because
we don't know what the impact of
[SPEAKER_01]: microplastics is with soil biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could shape the evolutionary path of
the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a defined way of remediating
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that we're seeing in
soil and it's something that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that I'm exploring and
how we can ensure that even though we do
[SPEAKER_01]: have a much shorter half-life with the
polyolefin coating, is there a way of
[SPEAKER_01]: remediating it and processing it sooner?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not hanging out, having some kind
of negative long-term impact that we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, what you're talking about is
having a media that at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth cycle would be essentially depleted
to the point to where your EC and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is back at where you started is
sort of the ultimate goal there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, in that there's no residual
coating left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to use, for instance,
the Osmocote, you could deplete
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, but there would still be that
residual polyurethane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know the impact of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the danger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the issue that we have with
scientific discovery is that we might come
[SPEAKER_01]: up with something that solves a short-term
problem that creates a problem 200 years
[SPEAKER_01]: from now that we can't see or even sooner
than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we have had such an
ecological impact with so many things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've done with technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a consequence, there's
always a cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where there's a benefit, there's
always a consequence or a cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never separated, there's always this
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of the challenge with
utilizing new sustainable technology is
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting systems to continue to create
balance so you don't have a long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't, I've looked into the data,
I've looked into the research,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's really just beginning as far as
microplastic content in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I look at even
with this product and being a part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: company, putting this product out is
really doing a deep dive on any possible
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that could have an ecological impact
that we wouldn't see right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look into that and I look at all the
benefits, but I'm also looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led me to specific types of fungi
that can break down polyolefin,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've already started doing trials on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a way of taking all of that
spent media, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then composting it and inoculating it
with this fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would basically use that polyolefin
coding as its food source and break that
[SPEAKER_01]: down and turn that into something that
would be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not recommending or at the point
of reusing the media at this stage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: game?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we've been reusing the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that I've been reusing the
media in indoor environments or primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I try not to reuse media indoors
unless you heat treat it, but I would take
[SPEAKER_01]: the media out and we've used it for
outdoor gardens and had a lot of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would I kill it back into the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the question, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want to have all the products we're
having be able to be used for
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever the waste is, how do we turn
that waste into something that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: just necessarily have one home after it's
been used for our purpose, but could be
[SPEAKER_01]: used for multiple different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of what we have to create with
sustainability is fluidity and flexibility
[SPEAKER_01]: with our waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's only going to create one product
or one purpose after it's being used,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might hit a bottleneck where you meet
the demand for that one purpose and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it just sits there and it becomes waste
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of looking at it is like what are
we reusing, pea or cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a way of reusing this in multiple
different applications with the lowest
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental impact possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm getting pretty granular on this,
but this is how deep I look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of what's happened and part of that
came from just my family background where
[SPEAKER_01]: my grandfather was in the installation
industry in the 30s and 40s and 50s and
[SPEAKER_01]: 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: These all the way through and they were
using a lot of asbestos at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time asbestos was widely
accepted and then the 80s hit,
[SPEAKER_01]: 70s, 80s hit, and then they found out that
that was pretty toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody that was involved in
manufacturing, distributing or selling
[SPEAKER_01]: asbestos was considered liable for what
happened to the people that got methyl
[SPEAKER_01]: selenium, I believe that's what it's
called.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at that, I look at my
grandfather's life as like a lesson where
[SPEAKER_01]: he went from doing incredibly well in life
and essentially had to pay out everything
[SPEAKER_01]: he had made in his life out to all these
lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't want to ever run into
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't want to ever be a part of a
product that would have that long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if companies in,
if we start thinking about that way,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like being a conscious company,
like thinking about all the possible
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts that your product can have and
then figuring out a plan to remediate it
[SPEAKER_01]: or don't put it on the market if there
isn't a way of remediating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that would solve a lot of
problems overall for everybody on the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just thinking about it a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so take me through how to use
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, starting at the beginning of
the growth cycle, you know, I've watched,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched in horticultural greenhouses,
you know, when we're doing like,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're doing like massive
propagation, you know, you poke a hole and
[SPEAKER_00]: they throw like a handful of Osmaco down
in that hole and then that plant's done
[SPEAKER_00]: and they go on to the next plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are you guys doing with your mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you use the fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use it in the same application,
but as that fertilizer releases,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be concentrated in one
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we recommend is to integrate it
into the substrate or medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer a specific type of peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Formulated by a company called Pinstripe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have any perlite in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I prefer that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with any like type of loose substrate,
it won't work in rockwool, doesn't work in
[SPEAKER_01]: rockwool, but for any kind of loose
substrate, you can either mix it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: pot or you can subdress it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could transplant and then you can
add the layer of the perl, the CRF on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of the level of substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to add an inch of substrate
on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, you want it to be in contact with
media that's been irrigated or has a
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture content level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have top dress before it worked fine,
but you're going to create a better
[SPEAKER_01]: balance of EC in the media if you
integrate it in or subdress it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll put some in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then I take it fairly early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you putting some in with like a new
seedling or do you wait a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: When does it go into media?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so if you're starting from clone or
seedling, most people are starting with
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of a rooting cube or rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to work for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be on your, your potting it
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're taking it to like a,
you know, quarter gallon or half gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: container, you would add the veg,
the V basis, which is the veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: veg fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a specific rate per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for V basis, it's 25 grams per gallon,
you know, for a little starter,
[SPEAKER_01]: three and a half inch starter pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually just throw a teaspoon in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you're bumping it up to the
next phase up, then you would,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, add in your complete blend of
the fortify the absolute flower and the K
[SPEAKER_01]: boost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to finish out the rest of
your veg time and with enough fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: to finish a 70 day cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So roughly 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to do the last up pot at least
two weeks before I'm moving into flower
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it carries through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I did notice you had like a K boost or
a couple other things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those just top dressed and targeted
times?
[SPEAKER_01]: You add them all in at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they release.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add everything in at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will carry through flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just going to be doing nursery
production, you just need, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for moms, you can use the V basis or the
absolute flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolute flower is going to work great for
vegging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the formulas formulated with the K
boost with the fortify.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the K boost has your, you're basically
a high level of potassium with some
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium in it fortifies essentially
calcium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the absolute flower is an
aggregate of your macro and micronutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you add all that in at the same time
and you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to add anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other than that starter pot,
you're, you know, if you're going in,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're taking a plant from a starter
plant into flower, you're just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: amend that, that fertilizer into the soil
and you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're doing a longer veg time,
it depends on how many up pots you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know if people are doing
like three or four up pots, maybe they
[SPEAKER_01]: are, but you would just add as the volume
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's say you have a one gallon
pot, you would add 25 grams of the V
[SPEAKER_01]: basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you take that one gallon into a
five gallon, well, I would only add a
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer for those additional four
gallons, not for the total five,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've already added in for that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to mention to folks too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was something that I had to put a
lot of thought into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just be transparent about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, knowing you, knowing the guys
over at Beanstalk, watching your process
[SPEAKER_00]: and formulating and improving this
product, thinking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: being an organic based company,
knowing that this is not an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: product, but yet more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that we're adding to our
product line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will be, people will be able to
order it through our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it took a lot of thought on that
because I realized I'm probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get some backlash on it, knowing that we
are an organics company and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to stay an organic based company,
but I do want to promote technologies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are more sustainable than what is
currently available on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me was more important than
being, you know, this organics versus
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical nutrients debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it took a lot of thought or,
you know, it was, it was a, it was not an
[SPEAKER_00]: easy decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to throw that out there to
people to just kind of stave off some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the comments or questions that people may
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to, you know, elaborate on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I appreciate you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you and I have had some great
conversations on, you know, just about
[SPEAKER_01]: life and sustainability and this product
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just appreciate you doing the due
diligence and even considering it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's exciting to work with you at any
level on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you don't get any backlash and
I hope people understand that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're all trying to figure out
the best path forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's not black or white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somewhere in between on getting the
whole world in a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to have solutions for people in
some of those challenging environments
[SPEAKER_00]: where, like you said, I can't,
you know, organics isn't always a good
[SPEAKER_00]: fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that is just poor regulatory
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I want to blame, you know,
that some of the, some of these state laws
[SPEAKER_00]: are just, they're not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, knowing that we do have to
fit into this box, there are, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: definite advantages to running a facility
with less, you know, less microbial inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, a media that's a lot,
that's either sterile or a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the amount, yeah, the amount of
challenges just with getting all the
[SPEAKER_01]: systems working right and, you know,
teaching all these new people how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: the fundamentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you factor in that, you could
have a really gnarly explosion of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, bacteria that you don't want in
your flower that could happen late flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's just not, it's not a
fun place to be, especially when you put a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of time into a crop and it looks
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you fail testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the worst feeling ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've, speaking of testing,
you've done testing on heavy metals with
[SPEAKER_00]: this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that's publicly
available?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's on our website,
but I don't have an issue sharing it with
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all within the right,
we're in all in the right limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's been people that have hit
me up about it and I've sent those
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had testing by batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're, we're maintaining the quality
control as it comes from the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so it's all been acceptable and
I haven't seen anything bio accumulate
[SPEAKER_01]: that caused a failed test and anything
that I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, which has been, uh, this is the
tight, the tightest regulatory system I've
[SPEAKER_01]: worked in and Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty, it's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so on the organic side,
when it comes to heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, first of all, in order to register
as a fertilizer, which is something we,
[SPEAKER_00]: the path we went with, with the soil and
our products, um, legally you're supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know not all companies have,
um, there's one selling, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom kits and things like that,
that are, that haven't registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I hope they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially what that does is it gives
you access to, you know, publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: available heavy metal levels too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can go on the WSDA website and
look at my company and see the heavy metal
[SPEAKER_00]: levels in our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure, you know, as you,
you know, you're registered in these
[SPEAKER_00]: States that, um, that's publicly available
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know that was correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys were working on, uh, in regards
to heavy metals and organics, I know you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, carrot, Dr. Kerry Peters mentioned
gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, these are things that you
have to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, soil doctor consulting, uh,
Bryant Mason's been doing some testing on
[SPEAKER_00]: that, which he shared some of that with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we're, this is something we're
constantly working at, but I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: people to freak out and think that,
you know, kelp's going to cause their
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to fail for arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's about management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not overusing any of these things and
just knowing what the heavy metal load is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're adding and also managing our pH
and arrange where those things may be less
[SPEAKER_00]: available and then running cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are going to be, uh, better at,
at navigating heavy metals and others,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not, not as efficient at taking
them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That last one is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I have definitely run into cultivars
that do like to bioaccumulate everything
[SPEAKER_01]: you throw at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is an interesting note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, people, I've seen people fail
for, for some crazy things in their rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm working on putting together a
better guide for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's just so many variables that
can contribute from dust to water,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, um, your plumbing, to your soil,
to your other inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I heard one, um, and then this is
still speculation, but I heard one lab
[SPEAKER_00]: claim that the pH down that this person
was using was particularly high in,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, certain heavy metals, but I'm waiting
for those lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I wouldn't share that anyway,
because I'm afraid of this company,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, just the idea, I want people to
be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Oh shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never even thought that might be
something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in regards to heavy metal, cause I
think heavy metals is really the next hot
[SPEAKER_00]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're not, um, we're not testing
our vegetables at this level, which maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: we should be here or not, but,
um, we all have to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're, if we're growing in a state that
has these requirements, we have to fit
[SPEAKER_00]: into these requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the impact matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the state has these regulations,
whether they're for good reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, an ignorant reason, or there is some
scientific basis, uh, that's just on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not available to the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we have to work within these,
these guidelines and it's extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, Oh man, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't use this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we, we have certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't want to get in trouble by
blasting it all out, but like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things that like we can't use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't use peroxide for certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just, it just, it's mind blowing to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it makes zero sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And peroxide is fairly safe just on like
cleaning Rockwell up or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's just a lot of restrictions,
a lot of tools that they take out and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no reason for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes if you, if you even ask them
why, uh, they get upset and then just
[SPEAKER_01]: won't pick up the phone for you anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like because they, and they just
might not have an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some of these states, we really,
we really, I wish that in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish that scientists and people that
study, uh, things at a granular level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not really a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I just play a scientist on TV or on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to hang out with real
scientists and ask them a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I owe, um, you know,
a lot of my success to a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: that, um, have a lot more understanding
about granular things than I do,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we really need, I'm just, if there are
scientists listening to this podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people in specific fields,
I know that most of you, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: speak to you right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know most of you, um, don't like to be
out in the limelight and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, vocalize your thoughts,
but right now we have so much crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I implore people that are experts in a
field to be courageous right now and to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, help all of us that are trying
to operate in this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that this is across everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, please just, you know, be more vocal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more scientists that are more
vocal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I, I think there's a huge
void right now where we can have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people coming out and talking about things
and educating, you know, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis community and everyone else
on what the science and the data is
[SPEAKER_01]: telling us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on tracking down a really good
chemist who specializes in water and can
[SPEAKER_00]: really explain the interactions between,
uh, different types of water and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: affect uptake of some of these,
um, specifically heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nutrients in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might, I might be able to help you with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk off there because I've
got, I've got some calls in to Dram and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, Suzanne and some other
people that are working on tracking down
[SPEAKER_00]: that like perfect podcast guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's in the works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, in terms of science,
Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say that I'll just
give a little shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the water treatment company that we
used for this facility, uh, was called
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced treatment technologies and
they've put in a pretty cutting edge water
[SPEAKER_01]: purification system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're able to deliver a high level of
dissolved oxygen in the plant and then use
[SPEAKER_01]: ozone for all of our cleaning protocols
and keeping the lines clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, that was, this is a
team member here that recommended this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was coming from the tissue culture side
and, uh, I have not, I, I'm incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: impressed with that system and with the
amount of knowledge, uh, that they brought
[SPEAKER_01]: to the table on this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would, I would say, you know,
bark up that tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing some interesting work and,
you know, on the, on like a scale level
[SPEAKER_01]: for agriculture and on like a laboratory
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Charlie over there, advanced
treatment technologies really came through
[SPEAKER_01]: for us here, uh, with my tree and what
they're doing with water purification and
[SPEAKER_01]: plants is pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm seeing the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now couldn't be more excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to touch on your science
con.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think science is a little bit
dogmatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of people doing
what they think of as science,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gets a little tricky because,
uh, you know, I found people throwing out
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that doesn't fit with sort of their
worldview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the reasons that I I'm
trying to have, you know, people like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Dr. Peters and yourself on the podcast
is to try not to get stuck in that sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of, uh, you know, dogmatic view where I
only look at one path to growing this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think we can all learn from each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have to do a better job as
cultivators of discerning and really
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to what people are saying and
running kind of that bullshit meter on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, you can have a fancy graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have, you know, different counts
of things, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if the, if the overall premise
doesn't add up or if they claim that this
[SPEAKER_00]: is the only way to grow a plant,
then I think we have to, we have to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: step back and see why some of these things
haven't made it into horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not to say that if it hasn't made in
court horticulture, it isn't good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is a good test of sort of that BS
meter in a lot of ways too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just, just to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're not following the data,
we're not following, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific method and, and, you know,
from hypothesis, you know, moving from a
[SPEAKER_01]: hypothesis to a theory, uh, we're not
following, uh, the system of science and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just leaning heavily on anecdotal
and, and story, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's where, uh, you know,
that's where con man and hucksters thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think right now in the world,
we just have a lot of people that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be very charismatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, convince a lot of people that
things work based off of an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they might mix in some spirituality in
that, which I think is a real abuse of
[SPEAKER_01]: spirituality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you need to sell
spirituality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's just like spirituality is
like a representation of how we're
[SPEAKER_01]: connected to everything that's alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that at some point science will
be able to explain that, but maybe not
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I, it's, you know, the cannabis
community is, you know, ripe for being
[SPEAKER_01]: taken advantage of, uh, by a lot of people
that are coming in and selling products
[SPEAKER_01]: that really, really don't have any
evidence, uh, of them being effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because there's a white paper
written about something doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's proving a claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that there's an abstract and
there's an exploration and, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I see like people posting abstracts
up, but not, not posting any of the data
[SPEAKER_01]: to support claims that they make around
specific methods or technologies or
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, like that's not how,
you know, that's, that's not how you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: something works or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just be really careful, uh,
and take your time if you're making big
[SPEAKER_01]: purchases or investing in anything and,
and know that there's, there's not data
[SPEAKER_01]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, who knows really,
so be wary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I just hope that more people that
study the data, uh, are a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: vocal about it and can do it in a way
where they can, uh, communicate even if
[SPEAKER_01]: people are getting upset or triggered,
for lack of a better word, that this data
[SPEAKER_01]: might conflict with their worldview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just, we just don't take into that
personal answer where people are right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, but doesn't mean you shouldn't say
something and just understand that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working, you're going to be communicating
a bunch of people who just don't know or
[SPEAKER_01]: have another narrative in their head or
another story of how things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I love talking to
scientists that study things on a granular
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned so much and that's improved
everything that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the biggest challenge
that we have to face in this space,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the, the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel like we're at a time in
history where there's never been more
[SPEAKER_00]: polarization in our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the last thing we need in
the cannabis industry right now is to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting over, you know, dogmatic views.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, at the end of the day, we're all
trying to grow a plant, um, as to the best
[SPEAKER_00]: of our ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and sometimes I think we lose sight of
that, but in the name of science,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I, first off, I just a quick plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some white papers on our
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to read them, read the
methodology, run your own experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're sharing as much data as we can
trying to get stuff published,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, be partly because we're running things
in a commercial facility and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: research, uh, journals don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they want stuff done in a
controlled lab, which we don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing research at, you know,
with legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing research with gold leaf
gardens here in Washington state,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause I have access to both those
facilities and that's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this brings me to my next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to do some research at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm limited, uh, here within Washington
state to anywhere from six plants to 15
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be able to get up to 30 if I can
do a cooperative at my location,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm, I'm researching the laws cause I
want to be legal within the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: program here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, how do I set up the ultimate tent
grow from a scientific perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I want to test out science lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to test out, you know, your
fertilizer versus our soil mix and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and do a comparison there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to look at how different,
uh, M bar levels, you know, using the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: mats that we like, uh, will with our soils
will create different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's all these different things
I want to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the list is longer than my
lifetime, but I'm, I want to start doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this and documenting it and, um,
getting some trends going so I can figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out, Hey, this is, this is worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send this over to, uh, you know,
gold leaf gardens, but because I can't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that, like the, some of the more,
um, exciting projects, I can't really run
[SPEAKER_00]: at these facilities cause I can't risk the
crop loss, you know, they're mixing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a for-profit business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be really cognizant of that,
but you know, we're formulating new soil
[SPEAKER_00]: mixes, some new, uh, grow and bloom
formulas, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited about that side of
things, but I, I want to, I want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do some of it in house myself and
I miss growing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's been a few years off now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've been focused on kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wanting to be a, you know,
a good law abiding citizen as we were
[SPEAKER_00]: going through all these different law
changes in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been too busy, but now I feel like
I'm at a point where I'm ready to start,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, growing again.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I saw, I think I, I think I
saw your last garden actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if I'm correct, I think that was your
last garden, but I don't know if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: me to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you saw some, no, that was just
some outdoor plants for my dad to make
[SPEAKER_00]: into a texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an outdoor monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were purely, uh, for my dad's
neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, you know, I don't care if they,
at the end of the cycle, they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of PM or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that, uh, if you're going to set up
the ultimate 10 grow to do comparison,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you have to choose, you know,
your sample size of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you could get away with the sample
size of six plants, that would probably be
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're just going to do a side by
side, um, so six plants from the same
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar, uh, so you'd want that to be
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably take two to three times as
many clones, uh, that you would use and
[SPEAKER_01]: then select the ones that are the most
homogenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting a good comparison,
meaning they have similar root
[SPEAKER_01]: development, similar health levels going
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would take those and then you would
randomize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then distribute them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my thought would be, so here's,
here's what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe that would be easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can tell me what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want, I want to make sure that the
environment is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so essentially we're trying to control
for a variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thought was, let's just say I can do
15 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I register with the state medical
card, I can do 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get, I would get them from a
licensed facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get them as clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was going to run two,
at least if I want to trial the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, I would run two four by four beds
in a four by eight tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's say I wanted to test
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would just run something down the
middle to kind of limit some of the light
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap in the beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I didn't want to have to,
I, initially I started with like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want two separate tents because I want
to make sure everything is very controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I started thinking about that and
I was like, there's no way I can keep VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same environment in two
separate tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really need to be in the same tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do a
fertilizer trial and a lighting trial at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, totally one thing or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've kind of jumped around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I'm talking about multiple cycles at
this point, but let's just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just simplify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say I wanted to do a fertilizer
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same lights, same cultivar from clone
randomized, uh, in the same, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, let's say, let's, let's,
let's, let's, let's make it even more
[SPEAKER_00]: specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's run beanstalk versus, uh,
you know, our biochar soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have our biochar soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, this would get a little trickier
cause I'd want to grow it in the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we've seen better yields with a bed,
but I guess we could look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could grow beanstalk in the bed
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't necessarily need to though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could grow it in, you know, a seven
gallon pot and say, this is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Nelson program versus the tad program,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could, we, you know, we could
compare that and talk about the pros and
[SPEAKER_00]: cons of, uh, you know, wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why not do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do it in the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be interesting to do it because
you're going to have a different,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would have to do your biochar soil in
the same pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to keep the container
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to do it in a bed,
I would, I would recommend doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: beanstalk in a four by four bed too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's necessarily,
uh, uh, as, as a variable that we'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: to control as much, but we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, let's say even then we had two
beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: So assuming the light's the same,
how am I controlling an environment like
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, ideally, if I want to keep it within
the tightest conditions, would I even try
[SPEAKER_00]: and run like a small like CO2 sort of
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, cause the other thing is this
garage is insulated, but it's not heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my outdoor air is going to vary like
this time of year, it's probably around 50
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, if you run, if you don't run
CO2, it doesn't, I mean, if doesn't the
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 factor is just going to give you a
higher yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and you'd be able to run more light,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you'd be able to probably get
above 800 PPFD without having,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some big issues, uh,
if you were to run the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but if you're going to keep the
environment stable, you probably,
[SPEAKER_01]: you needed some sort of an environmental
controller and sensor, uh, like a Hydro-X
[SPEAKER_01]: Pro from Trollmaster works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, then you need a way of feeding,
uh, cooler air in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you kept that tent closed,
that would, that would positive pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: the tent, um, with some with like an
inline fan and some, and some carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: filters on the inline fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could, uh, use... Carbon
filters on the inline?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't, if you're pulling air in,
you want to make sure it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so you're just cleaning air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not, you're not talking about from
an odor perspective then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, unless you have to, but no,
I don't, but I've always run negative
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure because in the past I had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this trial, it's better if you're
running positive pressure and if it's in a
[SPEAKER_01]: room, I mean, you wouldn't really be able
to inject CO2 if you're using that fan to
[SPEAKER_01]: control that air speed, unless you're
adding CO2 to that room that was,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the tent was existing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could I run it sealed though?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was sort of what, that was what I was
wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you run a sealed room that small?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a silly question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not, not really, because you've got to
have some kind of, uh, you've got to have
[SPEAKER_01]: cool air coming in.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you, but what you could do is you
condition the room outside of the tent and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you use, uh, like a voltage control,
like a potentiometer control, the speed of
[SPEAKER_01]: the fan that's moving the air into the
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would use that fan the same way
that a fan from an air handler,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you would get your room
temperature, uh, that the tenant sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: in where you want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you push that air in and then you
could add CO2 into that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, but you'd have to feel
that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering, like, could you run it
sealed, you know, more or less quote
[SPEAKER_00]: unquote, but then just do controlled air
exchanges every so often to, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring in fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that was kind of what I was,
I was thinking of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I've never done it on,
I've, you know, on scale, sure on a room,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've never, I didn't know if anyone's
done it in a tent or if that was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could, but then you had, you could,
but you'd only be getting, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd only, that CO2 wouldn't hang out
very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you have, uh, you know,
a control, a brain, a little control brain
[SPEAKER_01]: like Hydrox, and then whenever the
temperature gets to a certain set point,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to kick that fan on and it's
going to suck the cold air from outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: the tent and push it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could program it to when that fan
turns off that the CO2, uh, then would
[SPEAKER_01]: release into the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but anytime that fan turns on,
you're just going to be pushing that CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not going to get, you're going
to get some benefit, but it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the same thing as like a sealed room
running it at 1500 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure how well that would scale
down to something that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it's, I mean, a lot of people
have played around with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I played around with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just intense if I'm doing testing,
I just don't run the CO2 and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I try and stay below 800.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hang out between 600, 800 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a light meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm, I'm curious to try LEDs because
the last time I tried, every time I tried
[SPEAKER_00]: a tent in the past, I've, I've pretty much
failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, usually because I ran too strong of
lights and, uh, just could not control the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat no matter how much airflow or,
um, you know, even with like an eight inch
[SPEAKER_00]: air cooled ducting with a massive fan on
there, I could not get the heat down low
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to where, um, was it with LEDs or
no, this was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was back in the day with like single
ended HBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I just, I roasted some
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually survived better than I
thought they would have considering the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat pressure they were on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, I, uh, you know,
I way, way back when I first started and
[SPEAKER_00]: people will probably laugh at me for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw a thousand watt in a, in a tent
and, uh, ramped it up and came back the
[SPEAKER_00]: next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you run it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you run it at a hundred percent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a Luma tech balance going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it all the way up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cranking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thing was so bright and I came back and
opened up the tent and it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just stepped into like tropical
paradise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that's how you learn my
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've, I've made all those mistakes
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I went from like a 400 watt CMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that worked fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, you know, that wasn't,
it just wasn't enough PPFD that I felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was really getting the growth I
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually just ended up saying,
screw this, taking down the tent and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just setting up my garage is really what
ends up happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big, how big was that tent that you
had the 400 watt?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a four by four, if I remember
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one was a four by four and that
was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I just, I ended up being like,
screw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to take everything out into
my garage and hook up the thousands and
[SPEAKER_00]: really let it, let it go to town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's what I've done every
single time I've taken it down halfway
[SPEAKER_00]: through the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just get fed up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll use, so, so do this tab use like
a 300 watt led, uh, use like the veg
[SPEAKER_01]: light, you know, but I don't want to,
but you don't, yeah, but you don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: that much light, especially if you're not
running.
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 and you're going to have like a
moderately controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you, if you get that, like a 600 watt
led or 650 watt led, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: probably end up just dimming it down
because it's that it's going to be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: tight to the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've grown under the veg lights,
like from spec grade and from fluent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've gotten, you know, an ounce and a
half of square foot, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: without CO2, you just don't need that much
light, especially if you're just doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you don't need that much light for
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you need, you do need more light if
you're trying to like maximize every
[SPEAKER_01]: square foot that you have and you're
trying to optimize everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in a tent for personal use,
I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could go ham on it,
but it's not necessarily needed in those
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anything, that extra light without
added CO2 and environmental control is
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to cause uptake issues and then
balances in the media and then give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, probably not as accurate of
a trial as you desire, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious to start playing around with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, ultimately this tent set
up would just be for me to get trending
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and some numbers so that I could then
take it to a facility and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, run this again in your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, on a little bit bigger scale with a
little bit more controls, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, this is something I've been wanting to
do for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think, uh, you know,
kiss has really been focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I feel like overly focused on the
commercial side of things like commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to discount people that
are growing at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I think some of the weights
that we grow have a lot of applications
[SPEAKER_00]: for home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the science that we're using
in our soils and things like that can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely apply to someone with six
plants as much as it could to someone
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, 600 or 6,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and, and if somebody wants organic
product, um, they might have to grow it at
[SPEAKER_01]: home if their market is so tightly
restricted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the other option,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone's really held that on,
on only consuming organic product that
[SPEAKER_01]: might have to be, you know, in their tent
and their garage or room somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure there's people listening to
this podcast that are a lot smarter than
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably have feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to send it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I haven't purchased anything for this
tent grow, but I'm, I'm, I'm getting ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to pull the trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already got a few lights lined up
that I'm going to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for one thing that I know I want to
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already trialed a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm at, um, at, uh, gold leaf and I've
got that data, but I haven't wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: publish it just yet because it's such a
political market around lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really want to, uh,
you know, have people run to too many
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions based off of these trials and,
and, and also feel like I'm, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bashing one company and promoting another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to be real careful around
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I will say that the trials we ran
all three led companies crushed the double
[SPEAKER_00]: headed HPS in yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, I can tell you this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you this too, like 90% of all
the leds on the market are like coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: of one factory in Shenzhen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like there, there's not a ton of
differentiating factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's like the warranty price,
the warranty, uh, and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: architecture of the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a few companies,
um, that are doing things differently and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a lot of like, I like science a lot
because they, they have a manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in Texas when they're building these
lights, putting them together in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm super stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the lights are coming,
um, from a few factories in China and they
[SPEAKER_01]: just put a little bit of a spin on the
casing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tough to, unless you really kind
of dive in and open up the light,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's tough to know what's different about
all of them in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, based on your recommendation,
and a few others, I, that is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights that I'm definitely, it's top of
the list to trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is one that, uh, I was just talking
with Cindy about adding this to our
[SPEAKER_00]: website today to be able to offer its
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will have that as something if
you're looking to try science lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: get them through us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I, you know, BIOS is another
one that I've worked with for a few years
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have a good relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know what's happening with my
relationship with Fluence right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, we're not currently offering
their lights at the moment, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: still around in a good company too for
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then there's like a whole bunch
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I was talking with Ben about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would not want to be in the led
space right now, cause there's a million
[SPEAKER_00]: companies out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're oversaturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally just mailed a light to my door
the other day for no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I'll trial it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm going to give it a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a spinoff of a well-known
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I don't want to say anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say anything about them
until I've actually tried their light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, uh, there, there's a lot of
great options out there now under lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: for full spectrum lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when the, when we first started,
there was, there was nothing like there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a blur pro lights and then people
were laughing at full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've seen that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then there really wasn't a lot,
you know, initially the only two companies
[SPEAKER_00]: I ever heard about were Fluence and BIOS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, I know that some of
the, some companies have had supply
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's just so many more options.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that both Fluence and BIOS
really kind of paved the way, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: for that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's crazy how quickly it exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, we've like the jungle boys has
an led room now and they have their own
[SPEAKER_01]: led light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember like six, seven years ago,
uh, that they just, they were never going
[SPEAKER_01]: to switch over to led.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, like this whole thing and
you're just seeing people all over
[SPEAKER_01]: adopting this technology and figuring it
out and just crushing it and just
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely crushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's all these new, uh,
you know, there's companies that are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of crazy things with LEDs now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think all that competition is
hopefully going to inspire, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, more offerings and more features
and, and, and cooler stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I'm excited to see where it goes,
you know, I totally grabbed nothing to add
[SPEAKER_00]: to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, I feel like we're already running
a little long on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you and I, when we get chance,
we can usually talk for a fair bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, though our conversations aren't even
about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that we ended up talking about,
which podcast we're doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next podcast pad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to interview you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, since we still get asked,
and we're both on here, uh, I do have
[SPEAKER_00]: hopes for dope history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to track down a sound engineer
and production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've got a few leads I'm working on,
but I'm really looking for someone that
[SPEAKER_00]: can, uh, buy in on this concept at the
ground level and help us get it off the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Nelson, you've been really busy,
but you're hoping to plug back in,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, on it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're someone that willing to do a
little bit of sweat equity and help get
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing off the ground, um,
reach out, you know, if that's your
[SPEAKER_00]: backup, I've already got some interviews,
we've got the connections, we have an
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, I really want to crush that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just throwing it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't warn you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to bring that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm, I would love to see that get,
uh, revitalized and it's pretty much all
[SPEAKER_01]: my fault is why it hasn't happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you can blame it all on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got too busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, life throws.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll own it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll own it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate the chance to catch up
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're super busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm excited to hopefully reconnect
with you on even this dope history thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, once this facility is really up and
going, I know it's really consumed your
[SPEAKER_00]: time and, uh, I hope folks will check out
Beanstalk on, uh, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be offered through the kiss
organics website or the, uh, Beanstalk
[SPEAKER_00]: website directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll have the links to that as well on
the podcast page, as well as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a promotional offer for people when
this podcast comes out, if they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, that's it for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got anything else to add before we
sign off?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for the time and lots of love
to everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, uh, that's crushing it during this
crazy moment in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're all, we're all doing it
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, best of luck for this
year and hopefully your gardens are green.
