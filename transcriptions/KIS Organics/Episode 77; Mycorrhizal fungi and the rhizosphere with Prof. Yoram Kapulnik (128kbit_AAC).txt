[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest this week is Professor Yoram
Kapulnik.
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor Kapulnik is the executive
director of the U.S.-Israel Binational
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural Research and Development
Fund, also known as BARD.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the former director general of the
Volkani Center in Israel from 2011 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 2016, and prior to this position,
he served as the head of numerous
[SPEAKER_01]: institutes within the Volkani Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Born and raised in Israel, Professor
Kapulnik received his doctorate in soil
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology from the Hebrew University
and, as a Fulbright Fellow, completed his
[SPEAKER_01]: postdoctoral work at the University of
California, Davis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked for more than 25 years as a
professor of plant physiology and
[SPEAKER_01]: biotechnology at the Volkani Center,
Israeli Minister of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: His early work focused on the study of
plant microorganism interactions,
[SPEAKER_01]: mainly in plant roots, and their impact on
crop productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later, he concentrated on identification
and utilization of natural products
[SPEAKER_01]: produced by numerous plant species and
their health benefits to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor Kapulnik holds 14 patents,
trained more than 65 graduate and
[SPEAKER_01]: postgraduate students in his lab,
and has published more than 170 articles
[SPEAKER_01]: in his field in international scientific
journals and edited three books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Kapulnik, thank you for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I want to be waiting for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have a whole bunch of questions
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think your research is really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But could we start off talking to letting
listeners know a little bit about your
[SPEAKER_01]: background and who you are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I am a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obtained all my degrees here in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And towards the end of my graduate,
when I graduated from my PhD program,
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and I spent two and a half years in UC
Davis as a postdoc in the agronomy
[SPEAKER_00]: department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went back home to Israel and I
took a position in the agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: research and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a governmental institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the Vulcanis Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing about Vulcano, but this is the
Vulcanis Center, which is celebrating now
[SPEAKER_00]: this year 100 years of existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much before the state of Israel was
former, people here tried to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural knowledge in order to be able
to supply their food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I joined the field crop department and
I served as a scientist for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along my research, I took a lot of
administration position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one was that I was the head
of the ARO the agricultural research
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, the Vulcanis Center,
which consisted of out of 1200 employees,
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists, technicians, and students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this institute, I dived into what
we call it rhizosphere biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhizosphere is the close niche around the
roots, which is actually the soil which is
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of biology is happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just biology, chemistry and
physics, everything is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated to the first one or two
millimeters of the root surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I studied a lot of plant-microbe
interaction, as well as roots physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my background.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rhizosphere and the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during my academic year, I taught in
the Hebrew University a course,
[SPEAKER_00]: a course, this is a graduate course,
which is a root structure and function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, we hold the issue from both
ends, from the plant side and from the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the arena is the rhizosphere,
as I just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you have a fascinating background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I study on my own time a lot of the
rhizosphere interactions that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about purely from my own
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like such a complex
interaction between microbes, their
[SPEAKER_01]: exudates, the root exudates, and the
mineral content of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we dive into some of this stuff,
some of the questions I had about
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungus, can you kind of
summarize the symbiosis of that
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship and how it works?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the basic version that I would
put out there is the plants releasing
[SPEAKER_01]: exudates into the soil that the microbes
then consume and cycle nutrients back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant in addition to breaking down the
organic matter and other minerals that are
[SPEAKER_01]: existing in the soil and the plant kind of
controls this reaction, this interaction
[SPEAKER_01]: based off of the exudates that it's
releasing and the chemicals it's producing
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of elaborate a little bit on
that or talk about that relationship or
[SPEAKER_01]: even correct me if I stated anything
wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you were right, generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, just to do a sick of,
you know, for our audience, they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that there is a lot kind of a
passive kind of a leaking system that
[SPEAKER_00]: incidentally the plant is losing one
molecule or two molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are talking here about a massive
phenomena.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 30% of the photosynthate,
I mean, all the carbohydrates that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is accumulated through the
photosynthesis, is actually finding its
[SPEAKER_00]: way at the end of the day or along the
whole relationship in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a very rich environment
relative to the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find in the root exudates a lot of
sugars, of course, but also vitamins,
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acids, you know, nucleic acid
molecules like DNA and RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whatever you think of the plant
content or the cell content, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can find it in the rhizosphere in a
certain concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually drive the whole
biology because you have consumers of
[SPEAKER_00]: those goodies which are being supplied by
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is competition to reach that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very, very active region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to remember that, you know,
the tip of the plant, the tip of the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: is not like a moment or mature part of the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exudates or the chemistry that you
will find around the root tip is totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different from the elongation zone or from
the branch zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of them has its own different
exudation mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually influencing the
biology around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once the plant, well, now if we take
it one level further, there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: saying there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, talking about chemistry discussion
between the plant and the microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of them can even reach farther
and penetrate to the tissue, to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, through the evolutionary
process that you need really to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: something good that the plant will allow
you, you know, to break in and to enter to
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we find a lot of several groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you probably are familiar with the
nitrogen fixation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are rhizobia which penetrating to
the legume plant and really fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a situation where the plant has
enough light, enough other nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a shortage in nitrogen, actually this
biological system can really feed the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire needs of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something which is very,
it's being used in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: like peanuts and soybeans are being
inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can actually, we were able to tie
them in to our conventional agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another group of microorganism,
these are mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the mycorrhizae, we have two distinct,
at least two distinct groups, some of
[SPEAKER_00]: which are not really penetrating to the
plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ectomycorrhizae fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of plant species which are
belong to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are colonizing
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial, like trees and shrubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we think of, I think of conifers
when I think of ectomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, like conifers, a lot of mushrooms
and, you know, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: ectomycorrhizae fungi which we know,
which has some gastronomic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a way, now I would like to drive
the discussion to the other group.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second group, those type of fungi
which has the ability, which with the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary process were able to colonize
the tissue itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look on the roots under the
microscope, you'll be able to see the high
[SPEAKER_00]: entropy of the endomycorrhizae fungi
actually spreading in the root tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but some of these fungi,
not all of them, can really produce some,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call it vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vesicles are storage bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only they can, the fungi can grow
in the rhizosphere, and like you describe
[SPEAKER_00]: very right, it can absorb some nutrients
and minerals and translocated to the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue, to the plant itself, the fungi,
the fungus can even store it for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tissue itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way, it's being protected and it is
ready to use in the roots itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some of the cases, the plant was able,
even kind of, if I describe it simply,
[SPEAKER_00]: to fool a little bit of fungus and to,
in a way, to consume some of this storage
[SPEAKER_00]: without permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's some, this is kind of,
we call it symbiosis, but in a way,
[SPEAKER_00]: each one of these parties is trying to
make living out of this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a situation that the plant is
suffering from lack of some minerals,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these minerals can be somehow
collected and transported to the tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, in exchange, the fungus is
actually receiving a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, photosynthesize,
which are coming from the leaves to the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, the fungus cannot do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we take the endomycorrhizal
fungi and we try to feed it artificially
[SPEAKER_00]: by any type of sugars, we probably will
not be able to do it on a petri dish in
[SPEAKER_00]: the laboratory condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the fungus really need vigorous
roots, which is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then comes another layer of question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How comes that the plant is allowing the
fungus to penetrate and to spread out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tissue itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: While when a pathogen is trying to do the
same, the plant is responding with plant
[SPEAKER_00]: defense response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that the plant has the ability
to defend itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, why mycorrhizal fungi
are able to spread in the tissue while
[SPEAKER_00]: other pathogens sometimes are being
blocked in many cases, they are being
[SPEAKER_00]: blocked or the plant is trying at least to
fight back and to prevent that penetration
[SPEAKER_00]: and colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a long story and we studied
these processes for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make a long story short,
I can tell you that somehow the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi, they are able to turn
off the plant defense response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a type of conversation telling the
plant, listen, guys, here comes the good
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't aim your ammunition against us
because we are at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are trying to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We the fungus try to help the plant and
that's the benefit of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I describe it a little bit and you're
right, rhizosphere is a very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: and active region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those organisms were able to
identify a unique mechanism by which it
[SPEAKER_00]: will be justified really to create that
symbiosis, what we call it, for the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal rhizobium, which I just
described now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought of it as potentially in
the same way as I would a pathogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that makes a lot of sense that it
would need to somehow shut down that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: response as that sort of pathogen
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned some of the benefits
around this is it's a storage of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, it provides more nutrients,
it extends sort of the root system or the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability of the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the other benefits of
mycorrhizal fungus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the main ones we always
hear about is phosphorus uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of when you think of
that association, though, in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant benefit from it?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so first of all, just to make it much
more well, it's not just fossils,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're talking about most of those
elements which are not moving easily in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that in the soil we have the
physical structure and in between those
[SPEAKER_00]: particles we have the water which is
moving and a lot of minerals are being
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like iron and phosphorus are being
attached to the solid surface and are not
[SPEAKER_00]: easily moved with the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, mycorrhizal helps to the
plant to reach out and to receive more of
[SPEAKER_00]: those elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing which is very clear to us
that something in the physiology of the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots is altered by the existence of the
mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the resistance to plant
nematodes is much, much higher when you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a mycorrhitic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another benefit which is well known at
the plant level is there is kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancement of the photosynthate which,
well, in a way the mycorrhizal is charging
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant but at the same time it's
helping the plant to gain more
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How it's being done?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being done by altering a little bit
the very, very simple and unique
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can call it hormone-like molecules are
moving in the plant itself and that signal
[SPEAKER_00]: is reaching the leaves and influencing the
leaves itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can influence the evaporation by
stomach closure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the plant is not losing so much
water but in the same time is enhancing
[SPEAKER_00]: the photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we move out of the plant and we'll go
back to the rhizosphere, something which
[SPEAKER_00]: is really unique about mycorrhizal,
and this is true to endo and
[SPEAKER_00]: ectomycorrhizal as well, is that hyphae,
the fungus itself, which is somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: growing or spreading away from the plant,
the fungus itself, the hyphae is being
[SPEAKER_00]: exudating also some more molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those molecules are enhancing the
aggregation of, that's actually improving
[SPEAKER_00]: soil properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a small aggregate you have in
the soil, so the water intention and the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of the soil is much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizal helps the plant tremendously
in this level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last and not least, now we are talking
about the communication between nearby
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that hyphae which is acted to one
of the plants, it can reach out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor plants, to the nearby plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see a lot of signals and even
some molecules which are moving by the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal from one plant to another
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very important to, when you're
talking about field crop, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: field crop, the plants are so dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes, let's say your water is not
reaching out at the same level to every
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mycorrhizal is there to somehow to
smooth the differences between the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and to create kind of a more unique
population of plants per growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a lot of first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was more and more things which can
be added to that, but I think that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned the key or the most important
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that, well, here I need to say
something which in a way is contradictory
[SPEAKER_00]: to what I said a couple of minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you that in order to spread into
the plant, somehow the plant defense
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism should be shut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that reduction in the ability of plant
defense response is only for a short
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that the plant which is
mycorrhitic is when a pathogen is reaching
[SPEAKER_00]: in just after colonization with
mycorrhizal, then the plant is responding
[SPEAKER_00]: much more aggressively in terms of
altering the plant defense response upon
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting back when the pathogen is trying
to colonize the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those type of changes on the physical
side, but also the chemist and the
[SPEAKER_00]: hormonal side, are very, very clear for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant which is mycorrhitic may be a
little bit more sensitive at right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next vicinity to the penetration attempt
of the mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after a while and a while I'm talking
about half a day, a day, everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually retrieving back and the plant is
not exposed by the mycorrhizal to a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that it will be weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always created a stronger situation
later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So overall you're getting a better,
you're getting more ability of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to protect itself against pathogens when
it has that mycorrhizal association over
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you know, we know from different
crops that even the flowering is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get an earlier flowering on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need less date for the flower set,
which is very important sometimes in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, especially in a region which
are dry region, you really want to finish
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a question only of enhancing
the mineral status or the nutritional
[SPEAKER_00]: level of the plant, is a question of more
kind of a hormonal effect which sets the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering a little bit earlier and that's
very, not only earlier but more uniform
[SPEAKER_00]: even.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it on tomato and cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them you can see the flowering
coming earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying earlier flower set and
did I hear you correctly when you said
[SPEAKER_01]: that a mycorrhizal association actually
affects the opening and closing of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stomata?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we ask ourselves, how come?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if the plant is,
you know, when you close the stomata,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way you are not losing water if you
have, you know, high temperature or dry
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the same time, you block the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, CO2 cannot, CO2 is not getting
into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the machinery of photosynthesis is,
in a way, is slowing down because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have enough CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's really happening there is that
under dry conditions, somehow the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal is allowing the stomata
staying a little bit more opening on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stress when the stress is how we call it,
when you initiate the stress on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the stress is over and we are
talking about recovery, the mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are able to open their stomata
earlier than plants which are not
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, mycorrhizal plants are using
more effectively the light hours or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, more effectively the
photosynthesis process, even though there
[SPEAKER_00]: are some environmental stresses which are,
which in a way, imposing stomata closure
[SPEAKER_00]: with mycorrhizal, you do it a little bit
more smarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, by that, you're allowing the
plant to have more CO2 and to fix the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon when mycorrhitic, when
non-mycorrhitic plants cannot do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned something new that I really
appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk more about specifically
some questions around mycorrhizal,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm worried that people listening to
the podcast may not really understand that
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're talking about endo and
ectomycorrhizal in relation to plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're talking about essentially a family
of organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not one particular species here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to just kind of highlight this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of, let's say, a tomato crop
or a cannabis crop, that has a specific
[SPEAKER_01]: endo-mycorrhizal relationship,
not an ecto-mycorrhizal relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I see a lot of these products out
there here in the United States that will
[SPEAKER_01]: have, and I pulled one up to give you an
example, it may have 83 propagules per
[SPEAKER_01]: gram of an endo-mycorrhizal species and
then 187,000 propagules per gram of an
[SPEAKER_01]: ecto-mycorrhizal species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that creates a total number that's
much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that ecto-mycorrhizal doesn't have a
relationship with our cannabis crop or our
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other associated benefits to
having these high levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: ecto-mycorrhizal in the mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my own experience, I don't have a
reason to believe that ecto-mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi do have a significant effect in
cannabis, but I never tried myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that I can tell you,
and I should start it from another thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that probably your audience will be
astonished to hear, is to learn that about
[SPEAKER_00]: 85% of the plant kingdom is being
colonized with endo-mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm referring to endo-mycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to raise these fungi,
the endo-mycorrhizal fungi do need a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: which is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are lucky for the ecto-mycorrhizal
fungi, remember those creatures which are
[SPEAKER_00]: not penetrating to the plant root,
for them we are lucky to have a laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: technology that can allow us to grow the
mycorrhizal in laboratory condition and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need the plant and you don't
need the whole relationship and to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain this relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's much easier to raise the
ecto-mycorrhizal until biotechnological
[SPEAKER_00]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very tough to grow the
endo-mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many labs can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you'll find less proper groups
or less spores of endo-mycorrhizal in
[SPEAKER_00]: those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, that was our ultimate question
in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: How, because we try to study this
association and we try to purchase some
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculum and we realized that we cannot
find it, definitely not in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one which was on the market was so
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we dive in, in order to find
a way that will be a practical way and
[SPEAKER_00]: will give us a high number of infected
proper groups in the endo-mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you are right, in the sense that for
tomato, I'm sure that ecto-mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: does have, for soy, for corn,
ecto-mycorrhizal fungi do not have,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as I know, a significant effect on
plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the endo-mycorrhizal, those which
will penetrate to the root, do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant effect and this effect can be
created in a matter of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not months or seasons, it's a matter
of days and it's a significant... So if a
[SPEAKER_00]: small endo-mycorrhizal proper group you'll
have, you know, spores or other means of
[SPEAKER_00]: proper groups, then your inoculum will be
better as long as it comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: endo-mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of endo-mycorrhizal fungus,
there's a lot of different species out
[SPEAKER_00]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's known, I mean, we had a
collection that we brought to our
[SPEAKER_00]: institute from so many places around the
world and we had the collaboration with
[SPEAKER_00]: different scientists around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized that some of those strains
are better on a given plant species and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are not that efficient when you go to
another plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to find the right blend to a
given plant species in order to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you two examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is the fungus that we brought
over from the far east and that fungus was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to be very effective under low pH,
more acidity conditions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we had in Israel a lot of basic
soils and we were able to isolate some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them from some local species here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them were adapted to high pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you really want to create
a good product, you should try to have
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a blend which will, I mean,
you have two options.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is to get a super strain,
a super strain that will work effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: under different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can go ahead and have multiple
strains, each of which will have some
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial characteristic, I think you can
say like drought or flooding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of the strains which we are
isolating the desert, when you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: expose those strains to flooding,
they will not make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means the strains that we were able
to isolate, let's say, in the Israelis
[SPEAKER_00]: there, the desert will never make it with
rice in those pounds of high level of
[SPEAKER_00]: water above the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I think, two examples which
show you there are different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the industry, they have a very
wide range of different species and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can find the right strains all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the super strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the super strain sometimes is better,
it's easier to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to bring along the ecto,
mycorrhizae accounts for your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can depend solely on the end of
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something which is appreciated
by the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the price coming to the price
which is amenable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to raise, let's say,
three or four strains of different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for your blend, different
species, of course, it's double or triple
[SPEAKER_00]: the cost of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: While when you have in hand a super
strain, then it would be much easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce and to provide it to the growers
in a fair price or cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, essentially, this super strain will
work over a greater range of pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: greater range of water, moisture content
in soils, have just a more persistent
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to infect the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the one that's the most popular out
there that I've seen is Glomus
[SPEAKER_01]: interatices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's referred to now as
Rhizophagus irregularis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of like nomenclature,
it's hard when scientists change names on
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is this particular strain going to be
the same if it was produced, say,
[SPEAKER_01]: at a lab in Canada as compared to your
lab, say, in Israel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, although both of us are using Glomus
interatices, I will use the old
[SPEAKER_00]: nomenclature, we have different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one which we isolate here are coming
from, you know, from the desert,
[SPEAKER_00]: high temperature, low humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these are superstars which were
able to make it along the evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we are very persistent in a way to
take those strains over the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that we are producing it to take
them through very difficult times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it help us later on to maintain the
vigors of our strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones which are being produced under
tissue culture condition, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing a lot of spores per unit of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's like, you know,
we know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got used to that environmental
condition that everything is being
[SPEAKER_00]: provided in optimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you don't tip the growth
condition, which is a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, more tougher, then you probably
can get the benefit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in some cases, you know, and it's
happening to all of us, irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule is a little bit changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is kind of bumps in our
cultivations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really want something that will be
able to overcome those bumps, something
[SPEAKER_00]: that can iron those wrinkles in the
growing care, if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we decided to stay with
this more vigorous strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're saying are these strains
are not necessarily the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these tissue culture strains
essentially grew up in environments that
[SPEAKER_01]: are are essentially ideal for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when they get put in a situation
that's less than ideal, say in a growers
[SPEAKER_01]: soil where you might have more
fluctuations in temperature, water
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and things, they may not be as
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: As something that was more adapted to
those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly what I meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I just I just want to I just want to
clarify and make sure I'm understanding,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I want to talk a little bit
about the persistence in soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we do, can you clarify some
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know some listeners,
I saw a picture the other day of some
[SPEAKER_01]: really healthy root hairs online,
and they were claiming that this was a
[SPEAKER_01]: micro riza.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was it was a vegetable
root.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew that it was an endo mycorrhizal
plant that they were they were showing
[SPEAKER_01]: photos of the roots of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my understanding is you actually have
to stain the roots and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking through, you know, 80 times
magnification like a jeweler's loop is not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to allow you to see if your plant
actually has that association.
[SPEAKER_01]: What how can a grower determine if his if
their plant has mycorrhizal in fact,
[SPEAKER_01]: protection or can they really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very pessimistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girl, you know, first of all,
under lab condition, it's very easy to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the micro riza.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to stain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we we are using a specific dyes which
are which are bound to the hyphae of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus and they cannot be bound to the
root itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, you can see the hyphae very
clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't stain the roots, you cannot
see you cannot see the mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That answers the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, that's very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just looking at the root hairs
will not tell you much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you have nowadays, you know,
scientists actually they learn more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is specific molecules which is
being accumulated in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have mycorrhizal,
if you have colonization down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, that molecule is accumulated in the
leaf up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really required a more
complicated and sophisticated chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis and machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, not now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope that we'll have in the future
also some kind of a kit that will tell us
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly you know, you can take the you can
squash a leaf in against, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a small plastic and then drop have a
couple of drops in and it will change the
[SPEAKER_00]: color and will tell you if it's
mycorrhizal or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's still a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some people are working on it,
but it's still far from from application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for clarifying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned that the infection takes
a period of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's sort of that range of time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And along those lines, are we really
seeing results in a in a fairly quick crop
[SPEAKER_01]: like let's just say lettuce versus
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you is there any real benefit to to a
mycorrhizal infection in some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: faster crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a spore, let's say there are a
couple of ways to get the mycorrhizal into
[SPEAKER_00]: your root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way is to have a spore, which is that
it's kind of it's like a seed in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not a living organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a living organism,
but it's in a dormant dormant stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about five days from the moment
that you expose that spore to the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please listen very carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not from the moment that you wet the
spore when you expose the root to the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere and that the spore is being
exposed to a molecules which allow it to
[SPEAKER_00]: break, which allow them to break the
dormancy and hyphae is a merge is emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: from the spore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can say see penetration to tissue
to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not to every part of the roots only
at the young stages of the roots at the
[SPEAKER_00]: root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you you can you know, you can see
colonization at the moment to part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots after let's say seven two weeks or
something like that, but definitely the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae can colonize the plant and can
can be established in a matter of days or
[SPEAKER_00]: we can say after, you know, like three
weeks you should start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you have the right condition
you can start seeing some differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between mycorrhitic and not mycorrhitic
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, well, it really depends on the
growth condition of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant is more stressed then the
effect of the mycorrhizae is more obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it can be distinguished very
easily, but we don't want to get to such a
[SPEAKER_00]: stress condition in our crops in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it will take a little bit
more, but it's in a matter of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, four to five weeks and
definitely you can see some changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely when you if you if you do
tissue analysis and you look for
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and iron, you'll see manganese,
you'll see high concentration of those
[SPEAKER_00]: elements in the plant itself and it will
start affecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question is how bad the
environmental condition is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if your plant again is a very
optimal condition, nothing is missing
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the right wavelength,
the right humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation in the soil is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you might not see even the effect of
mycorrhizae because everything is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to bear in mind that that
relationship with the fungus is costly
[SPEAKER_00]: because the plant need to invest and
actually to put aside some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesize which is being accumulated
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if the plant is not suffering and you
have everything, so why to invest in
[SPEAKER_00]: something that will not do any different?
[SPEAKER_00]: For many many crops we say that it's like
an insurance policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put this mycorrhizae just in case if
something will happen, if something will
[SPEAKER_00]: break, if something unexpectedly will
appear there and then you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae to help you out in that
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can even use the same the same saying
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a wrinkle in your growing
protocol, the mycorrhizae can iron it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it will not be that deterred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't stick to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant will not suffer so much from
that mistake or that change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment or that unexpected situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way mycorrhizae sometimes if you
have excellent growth condition it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: very hard to see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know that always there are some
time points that we don't know but
[SPEAKER_00]: something has been created or some regions
along the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you have irrigation in the top of
your soil and down there the roots can be
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that but you have probably over
wetting and your roots are being exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to an anoxia and not enough oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again mycorrhizae can help you out and
that's the benefit of having mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_00]: in your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I think in reality you know in the
real world in normal growing conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: even with controlled environment
agriculture there still are a lot of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one is growing in a perfect optimal
plant conditions for the entire growth
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least none that I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: For them to form this relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things you touched on here
was that if the plant has perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions it's not going to form this
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that in association with high
phosphorus because the plant says I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: getting all the phosphorus I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to bother with this
mycorrhizal association even though
[SPEAKER_01]: there's other benefits to the mycorrhizal
infection like you just stated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some of the best practices for
using endomycorrhizae?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like it needs to come in direct
contact with the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be directly in the rhizosphere
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to apply it early on in the
plant's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think a transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see?
[SPEAKER_01]: Avoiding high P was the other one that I
wanted to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of your recommendations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well for my own experience as soon as you
apply the mycorrhizal it's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to reach those roots
the young part of the roots which are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the those are the best location
to colonize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have the mycorrhizal as a close
vicinity to those locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you you know we tried a couple of years
I can tell you a lot of stories but we we
[SPEAKER_00]: try to apply the mycorrhizal by drilling
some holes to a more mature plant and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to imagine to yourself how you know
how much of the root surface really was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to enjoy the mycorrhizal existence of
the mycorrhizal and that's created the
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that the volume of the root
system which which mycorrhizal can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with is very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefit to the plant would be also
smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still remember that you know having
saying so I was involved in an experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Kew garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Kew garden in England there are
some plants which you know very old plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we try to help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very old and they were not
really in a bad way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old plants you know this is the right way
to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you you really want to have
mycorrhizal there so what we have done we
[SPEAKER_00]: injected mycorrhizal around the trunk
trying to reach some of the roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing that old plant to enjoy better
the grown condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know we tried also in Israel in the
cities some play you have some trees that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not actually receiving and the right
condition and are suffering from soil
[SPEAKER_00]: compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to to inject mycorrhizal but we
saw some benefits after a while and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the type of experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes up even half a year until you see
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to enjoy mycorrhizal in
the growing season make sure that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: it right there in the right position and I
know that there are some recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: to put mycorrhizal on the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So well I can tell you again it will take
ages to dose infection units and mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: spores you know to a spore which is a very
it's a big structure to really to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through soil layer and to really reach the
root tip you know which is sometimes 10 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 centimeters away is edges it's ages
you'll not be able to make it in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you have the mycorrhizal
around the right region on the roots then
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that you'll be able to colonize
better the entire root system and also you
[SPEAKER_00]: know maybe it's worth to mention
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the mycorrhizal is penetrating the
hypha is penetrating to the root tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next stage or the next step for the
mycorrhizal is going and looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: something to eat to get more
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you have more photosynthesis when
you're entering at a root tip I mean you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to migrate or to being expanded or
grow upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most of the direction of the
mycorrhizal is from the root edge of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tip to the more mature towards the shoot
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going upwards and not downwards
and if you have a mycorrhizal and you
[SPEAKER_00]: apply it on the top it's barely reach the
root system and you'll be able you'll not
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to colonize the entire root system
and then you'll blame the mycorrhizal that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not working well it's not working
because it's not being spread downwards
[SPEAKER_00]: it's being spread mostly upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you put the mycorrhizal when
you have almost most of the root system
[SPEAKER_00]: around it you can you can make sure that
more of your root system is being will be
[SPEAKER_00]: colonized by the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great because you see these you
know micronutrients micronized products
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal products here in the United
States and really they're not you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: micronize a spore you're micronizing the
carrier for the the mycorrhizae and even
[SPEAKER_01]: then like you mentioned trying to get it
to work its way all the way down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots is going to take a long long time if
it even makes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just recommend to listeners
that you follow this advice and apply it
[SPEAKER_01]: directly to the root zone if you have the
ability to do that with a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other question I had around this this
idea of application is I see a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: products that have trichoderma and
mycorrhizae in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard from some scientists that this
is a symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard from others that due to the
aggressive nature of trichoderma some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the speculation is that the trichoderma is
is the benefit that allows a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: people are seeing and not necessarily
mycorrhizal because the other issue there
[SPEAKER_01]: too is the relationship will be like a
thousand to one in terms of trichoderma to
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts in regards to
trichoderma and mycorrhizae?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well in our hand we tried it because the
trichoderma was enter to the practice to
[SPEAKER_00]: the nursery practice before mycorrhizal
here in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to do to show compatibility to
see if you know what's really happening
[SPEAKER_00]: there and maybe the trichoderma would
somehow eliminating the the mycorrhization
[SPEAKER_00]: of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our hands we could see them living
side by side with no significant reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: of in mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a full trichoderma treatment
the recommended treatment I'm not you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any experience with those
products that are being sold in the US and
[SPEAKER_00]: but the mycorrhizae that the trichoderma
which is being sold here in Israel I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that it's not harming the
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my own experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way those strains that are being
right now used are being used by
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those strains came from our
collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can survive with a co-inoculation
with no much of effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does mycorrhizal fungus persist
in potting soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we were reusing our potting soil I
assume that there would be potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: some propagules in there, hyphal
fragments, spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to be reapplying mycorrhizal
fungus every you know every cycle in
[SPEAKER_01]: situations like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a good population in your soil
and it's not just to have them you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the right strain in the right
concentration probably you may not need to
[SPEAKER_00]: add more mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you know that's not always because
you know sometimes you check for
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae in your soil and then you know
that soil would go to the warehouse and
[SPEAKER_00]: will stay there for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to remember that in order to
maintain mycorrhizae you need the leaping
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is no going roots there some
of these populations will be affected of
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something which you need to make
sure that everything is fresh and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually I never trust the potting mix
to be the sole source of mycorrhizae of
[SPEAKER_00]: our studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually applied fresh inoculum every
cycle and when you start it at early
[SPEAKER_00]: stages the amount that is being needed for
application is small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really worth taking the chances
you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's absolutely cost-effective to
apply it early on the plant's life because
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't need very much and the biomass
is going to grow along with the root
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes a ton of sense and one thing
I also see with labels is people will buy
[SPEAKER_01]: potting soil that will list mycorrhizae on
the label but in reality the amount that's
[SPEAKER_01]: in there is so miniscule and small that
they probably won't get infection or if
[SPEAKER_01]: they do it will take way too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm relating it to is for people
who do let's say you know some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities that are growing cannabis in a
raised bed will inoculate their plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: that bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant will flower out in the bed and
then they will pull the plant and leave
[SPEAKER_01]: root fragments in the soil and then plant
another plant back into that bed another
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant within you know 24 to 36
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering if you know doing this
five times a year over the course of
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple years if at some point there
would be enough mycorrhizal you know
[SPEAKER_01]: hyphae or propagules that you wouldn't
necessarily see a big difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit in regards to direct application
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the right strength as I
mentioned before and probably you reach a
[SPEAKER_00]: level that there is no point to add more
mycorrhizae in then you really can I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how many cycles you need in order to
reach there but biologically it's
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay yeah and one other thing that I
wanted to highlight is along these lines
[SPEAKER_01]: from what you're saying it makes no sense
to just mix the mycorrhizal spores
[SPEAKER_01]: homogenously through our soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like that would be not very
economical relative to applying it
[SPEAKER_01]: directly to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that's what we we we we try we call
it like I mean we try to to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation when we dust I mean you you even
can raise your let's say if you can if you
[SPEAKER_00]: missed it then you cannot really you are
not applying it to the to the to the
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting plague in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have the first when you transfer
it to the to the next stage then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: dust off the whole how we call it a chunk
of root plague with a mycorrhizae and then
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that every segment which is
merging out of that plague to the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow will be will get infection and
that you can do it this way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't really need much for that
it's like you know if you like a dusting
[SPEAKER_00]: donuts with sugar I mean you don't need
much of it you just need to and the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: or the excess amount you can you know kind
of shake it and it's really minimal amount
[SPEAKER_00]: only on the surface and and you can make
sure that you'll have in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration and really meet the terms of
good colonization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one of the things that I want to talk
to you about real quick before we get off
[SPEAKER_01]: the phone call was you helped create in a
lab this this particular super strain of
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungus that is used in the
product dinomyco correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I can talk yeah I can talk about it
in general terms of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some of this stuff is proprietary
and I just mean in terms of you worked on
[SPEAKER_01]: this particular product and you saw some
of the results around it I was hoping
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you could cover that not necessarily
the the methodology which you may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the exact question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean yes we I know many of this I know
those strains you know the superstars
[SPEAKER_00]: there is more than one but even the the
best one of course I'm familiar with that
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that that product came through
a very intensive
[SPEAKER_00]: development which is technically but also
biological development which allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: which brought it to the level that you can
have millions and millions of spores which
[SPEAKER_00]: are free of soil of course and you can
really make sure that you have just
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal and you can set it up in a way
that you have in small volume a very high
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of spores in a very not just
efficient but a very effective way for
[SPEAKER_00]: infection and that's something which is
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean they are actually giving you
something which is maybe I should use
[SPEAKER_00]: which is being primed ahead of time and
ready to go and this is the advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: that product and you know and the results
are nothing better than where you you know
[SPEAKER_00]: see the effect of the product on the plant
is very convincing and I think that the
[SPEAKER_00]: uniqueness of this product is many growers
probably can tell you better remember that
[SPEAKER_00]: I never did it myself everything was done
by application to to to cannabis was was
[SPEAKER_00]: not done in our lab but I'm sure that the
company they check it and they tried and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the proof is in the pudding I
mean that's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great great yeah so the this particular
product was originally researched and
[SPEAKER_01]: developed out of the Volcani Center
correct and then and then moved to a sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of a private enterprise but yeah that was
that was sort of what I was getting at so
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: One last question I had for you that was
sort of unrelated but one that I hear
[SPEAKER_01]: debated by growers that I think you could
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairly readily is this idea of rhizosphere
pH and the importance of pH some organic
[SPEAKER_01]: growers don't really don't use pH as a
tool because they say that the the soil's
[SPEAKER_01]: ability and the microbes ability to buffer
is so great that it's less important
[SPEAKER_01]: however some of us like myself feel that
while there is an aspect to that by
[SPEAKER_01]: optimizing pH in rhizosphere and in the
soil we're allowing for these the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: have less stress and to make these make it
easier for the plant to uptake nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on this and how do
microbes help in sort of that pH and
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere relationship?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all well microbes do have some
effect on the rhizosphere effect on the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere pH but the most important
mechanism that alter the pH of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere is the plant itself and in
order to absorb the anion and cation and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's exchange of anions and cations I
mean the nutrients the charge of the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules is very important and it's very
important if you feed your plant with
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium or you feed yourself with
nitrogen nitrate that's make a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on the pH of the rhizosphere so
that's something which which should be
[SPEAKER_00]: kept in mind if you really want to alter
the pH of your rhizosphere work out the
[SPEAKER_00]: the equations or the the compounds the
chemical structure of the nutrients which
[SPEAKER_00]: you are using if you'll have more nitrate
then your pH will level up if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: more ammonia your pH will level down and
that's more effective this is more
[SPEAKER_00]: significant than the microbes themselves
and of course the organic compounds which
[SPEAKER_00]: are being excluded from the roots are
actually also a second layer of effectors
[SPEAKER_00]: on the on the pH itself and that's
something which we can
[SPEAKER_00]: barely control control so the question is
what's really happening in the in the if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a lot of sugar let's say and you
have a surface strength I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: you it's a you know all the rhizosphere is
covered with microorganisms like exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: like in our gut you know and you know that
some of those microns are responding to
[SPEAKER_00]: the given amount of the type of food that
we are eating I mean in our gut the same
[SPEAKER_00]: happening at the rhizosphere level and if
you know our rhizosphere is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: exclude some molecules the the bacteria of
there will transfer it with the molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: and can reach a situation that can
influence the pH and last and not least is
[SPEAKER_00]: the aeration in the rhizosphere do you
have enough air or you have anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: condition that will influence also the
type of bacteria that can grow there and
[SPEAKER_00]: we finally will affect the the pH
phosphorus sorry let's talk about sulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have free sulfate somehow you get a
lower pH in the in the rhizosphere so if
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemistry and the biology although all
the time is working and I'm sure that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you get a good recommendation if you
have a good nutrient solution that will
[SPEAKER_00]: have high buffer capacity then you can
eliminate those type of changes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere it's very important you know
trying to understand what group of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria you have there or other
microorganisms and trying to influence
[SPEAKER_00]: this microorganism is kind of indirectly
it will you know in a conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture is almost impossible so the
only way to go is to have a nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solution which has a high buffer capacity
and it can work out the difference that
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere the bacteria and even some
of the effect of the plant which I
[SPEAKER_00]: described it can can buffer it up and
that's something which it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciated and this is a practical
recommendation you know nowadays the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome is a new field that you know
you can dive into this field but it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: very hard to tip it of course if you'll
have if you'll put some compost in the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots then you are going to change the
flora but also the conditions in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: so yes pH is very important and a high pH
you really want to absorb if you really
[SPEAKER_00]: want your plant to absorb enough iron for
the chlorophyll to have a good color and
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis in the leaves you please
make sure that the pH will not be above
[SPEAKER_00]: seven and a half even lower than that you
know six eight or something like this if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a low pH then your plant will not
be able to absorb some of the goodies that
[SPEAKER_00]: is being needed for a good crop so this is
something which should be kept in mind my
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation is take a nutrient solution
with a high buffer capacity and that will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you to overcome those situation in
the rhizosphere so is it safe to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: the the rhizosphere plant rhizosphere
interactions and the rhizosphere itself is
[SPEAKER_01]: is highly complicated we are still
learning a lot about the soil microbiome
[SPEAKER_01]: in relationship to the rhizosphere and by
having the pH within a range that is more
[SPEAKER_01]: optimal for the plant all we're doing is
making it easier for the plant to access
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients which will potentially reduce
plant stress and allow it to put more
[SPEAKER_00]: energy into yield and growth and
protection you know if you if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: measure it if you can control it so I you
know under hydroponic conditions I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: you can you have more tools to deal with
that with the pH but if you have a potting
[SPEAKER_00]: mix it's it's harder to to start tipping
the pH in the middle of the season yeah so
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that we grow is primarily in
potting soils organic potting soils where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're using soil testing in between cycles
to sort of you know in some ways mimic you
[SPEAKER_01]: know outdoor agronomic practices by
managing that soil multiple cycles but in
[SPEAKER_01]: an indoor environment so we're constantly
adjusting our our nutrients that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting into the soil to maintain as
optimal of a pH and mineral balance as we
[SPEAKER_01]: can while still taking into account the
the biological aspects of the soil itself
[SPEAKER_00]: too yeah and of course you have to
remember that you have to change your
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule the nutrition schedule between
vegetative growth and reproductive growth
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you need a different schedule there
too I mean you cannot use one equation for
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire growth cycle for cannabis
growth right sure so the the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plant is going to want when it's
in a vegetative state are quite different
[SPEAKER_01]: than what it's going to want when it's
flowering right so you're saying yes that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes sense well Dr. Kapulnik I know I
could I could ask you a million more
[SPEAKER_01]: questions but I I know it's getting late
in the evening where you are in Israel and
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you taking the time to
share this information with us maybe we
[SPEAKER_01]: can chat again in the future sometime I
would I would love that thank you very
[SPEAKER_00]: much I enjoyed it it's a pleasure to talk
about the rises for not many people
[SPEAKER_00]: understand sometimes what we are talking
about and I would be very happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute from our years of experience
here to a new crop or a new industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are right now doing very smartly
and I would be very happy to to help you
[SPEAKER_01]: well thank you so much you have a
wonderful rest of your evening and thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: for coming on the show today thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you very much thanks for your support and
happy growing
