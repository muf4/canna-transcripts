[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first guest in 2019 is Jeremy Plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy is the Director of Production
Science at Proof Cultivar, one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: technologically advanced cannabis
cultivation facilities in all of North
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Proof, Jeremy combines decades of
cannabis horticulture experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting edge technology to deliver
previously unattainable consistency in
[SPEAKER_00]: both product quality and consumer effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to his leadership at Proof,
Jeremy was a co-founder of Pharma,
[SPEAKER_00]: recently acclaimed by Rolling Stone as one
of Oregon's top dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy has served as a cannabis consultant
to Israel Medical Cannabis Researchers as
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis policy advisor for U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: members of Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also serves on the OLCC's Rulemaking
Advisory Committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, Jeremy co-founded Cultivation
Classic, Oregon's leading craft cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: He serves on the Technical Advisory Board
of the Resource Innovation Institute and
[SPEAKER_00]: is the co-founder of the Open Cannabis
Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives in Portland, Oregon with his
border collie Lucy and when he can,
[SPEAKER_00]: finds few greater joys than sailing on the
mighty Columbia River.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a ton of questions for Jeremy after
hearing him speak at numerous events like
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo X, Emerald Cup, and the Cultivation
Classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this podcast though, Jeremy really
shares his background and passion for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the podcast, you'll hear
some of the questions I had for Jeremy for
[SPEAKER_00]: a follow-up podcast but please do reach
out with any questions you may have and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read my favorites in the next podcast
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email me questions at tadd at
kisorganics.com or post them on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram post for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Jeremy, thanks so much for coming on
the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a joy, Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well I met you a couple years ago
now at Photo X but I'd been aware of you
[SPEAKER_00]: and the work you were doing but I loved
what you talked about on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just sitting there in the audience
totally engaged and nodding my head to
[SPEAKER_00]: just about everything you were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited for this opportunity
to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you maybe go back and tell us a
little bit about yourself so we can let
[SPEAKER_00]: the audience know who you are and what
you're up to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love that event.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to have a moment with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit about my background is that
I've really always been involved with this
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing my best to serve what I believe
are incredibly growing and exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, things are changing fast so
there's a lot of fronts that I'm working
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really I started in Sonoma County and
really had a lot of time in what we sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of affectionately thought was the southern
tip of the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surrounded by really experienced
craft cannabis growers and was lucky when
[SPEAKER_01]: I was 15 after reading The Emperor Wears
No Clothes to be able to reach out to
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Conrad and Mickey Norris and sort of
say, hey, I'm really excited about the
[SPEAKER_01]: work you guys are doing and to be taken
under their wing for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go in Oakland and sort of spend
time with Chris especially as he was doing
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of different advocacy work.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pre-Prop 215 in the Bay Area and
there was just this hotbed of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are sort of most fundamental in
the ideation around medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: movement and just the modern hemp and
cannabis movement in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the first projects I was
involved with was actually Mickey's
[SPEAKER_01]: project where she had these sort of
A-frame signs with big posters about
[SPEAKER_01]: shattered lives and people's lives that
had been negatively affected by the drug
[SPEAKER_01]: war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was these anecdotes and we
would tour around and take them to various
[SPEAKER_01]: places like college campuses and sort of
tell these stories of shattered lives and
[SPEAKER_01]: illustrate the just painful outcomes of
the drug war.
[SPEAKER_01]: During that time was when I got really
turned on to the medical movement in
[SPEAKER_01]: earnest, became aware of people like
Brownie Mary and Dennis Perrone a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit later, but earlier became aware of a
clinic in Santa Cruz called Women
[SPEAKER_01]: Advocates for Medical Marijuana or WAM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was really a team that I believe
Rick Doblin from MAPS helped to connect to
[SPEAKER_01]: Israeli researchers after the government
was shutting down their efforts,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they were exclusively devoted to
cancer and AIDS patients and to providing
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time in the day, which is sort of
early 90s, there was of course this really
[SPEAKER_01]: horrible fallout with the AIDS crisis and
watching sort of what looked like scenes
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Walking Dead at points in places
like the Tenderloin in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would see AIDS patients on the street
with wasting syndrome really just
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing unbelievably low quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in their community, you would see
kind of a completely different story
[SPEAKER_01]: happening where people's quality of life
was really clearly improved by their
[SPEAKER_01]: reliance on cannabis and having it
administered in a consistent way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really where the light bulb
was going off and then eventually being
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to like Dennis Perrone's
Compassionate Buyers Club and just that
[SPEAKER_01]: whole movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I became aware that the properties
in cannabis that helped me to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty high levels of anxiety when I was
young and felt like a far more creative
[SPEAKER_01]: and productive alternative to alcohol
consumption and being in Sonoma County
[SPEAKER_01]: which is also the wine country and I was
surrounded by heavy alcoholism and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that in my family as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so cannabis just felt like a helpful
and exciting alternative, but little did I
[SPEAKER_01]: know it would become really a life's work
and something that I increasingly feel can
[SPEAKER_01]: really improve the quality of life for a
huge array of people around the world as
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all working on this endeavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, I moved from the Bay Area up
to Portland in 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Portland, Oregon is where I've been
ever since and I got involved immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: with the medical marijuana program here
and I'd already had a lot of years
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, almost 15 years experience in
the Bay before coming up, but then really
[SPEAKER_01]: became involved with a lot of patients and
in the work with patients over time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got better at sort of gathering
cultivars from around the world and really
[SPEAKER_01]: finding different sorts of medicine and
being able to administer that effectively
[SPEAKER_01]: through my gardens and a small network was
really the foundation of my work in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, I found some incredible
patients who had benefit and experienced
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good outcomes by being able to work
with them and ultimately I found their
[SPEAKER_01]: support was able to help me eventually
become involved in the dispensary program.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we became aware of the fact that
there was going to be a dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: program, in Oregon, it was clear that
actually I didn't have the resources or
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to kind of pursue that sort of
opportunity without partners, but one
[SPEAKER_01]: patient in particular, this amazing man
named Steve Bennett, really just got
[SPEAKER_01]: behind my work and let me use a lot of
resources really to be able to categorize
[SPEAKER_01]: chemovars effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time when I was actually a
pre-dispensary program in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a medical grower, there were very few
people pursuing chemical inventory of
[SPEAKER_01]: their product and I knew that there was
clearly a wide spread of different
[SPEAKER_01]: outcomes in the work I'd been doing with
patients and was desperate to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: categorize the qualitative attributes of
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very fortunate that a good friend,
Rich Cromlin, who goes by one eye and is a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder up here, he's associated with dog
walkers, strain and others, introduced me
[SPEAKER_01]: to a man named Pat Marshall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pat Marshall was the leading chemist at
Sunrise Analytical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking back, I now believe that Pat
Marshall was likely one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important cannabis chemists in the country
because he'd been going since the mid-90s
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was a really senior scientist who
had been the top scientist in city of
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland's water quality control and so he
was a master of gas chromatography and he
[SPEAKER_01]: was a patient activist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was really turned on to the idea
that cannabis was helping people and so he
[SPEAKER_01]: worked to kind of crack the matrix in a
sort of solo effort, looking very little
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of his own work and in a
disciplined way pursued sort of mapping
[SPEAKER_01]: all of this and then would be able to
produce analytical results that had 64
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So seeing this level of chemical diversity
produced by a really rigorous scientist in
[SPEAKER_01]: a consistent fashion was a huge
transformation in my work and my partner,
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve, really helped me to, in addition to
inventorying all of my own cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: even we paid for lab results for other
people's cultivars to start to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: what I am going to borrow some language
from a friend, Dr. Mark Lewis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was unintentionally beginning a survey
of the chemoscape in Oregon and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: find what were the most useful properties
and in a sense how did those combine with
[SPEAKER_01]: my production environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the shocking discoveries that
happened first when I started getting all
[SPEAKER_01]: these lab results was that essentially
when I gave four skillful producers the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact same genotype or the exact same
cutting taken from a mother plant that I
[SPEAKER_01]: provided, after the course of growing them
out and going to Pat's lab and testing
[SPEAKER_01]: them thoroughly and even retesting them,
we were able to validate that there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge range of chemical diversity from the
exact same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in one sample, there was like 28 point
something milligrams per gram of beta
[SPEAKER_01]: myrcine.
[SPEAKER_01]: In another, there was two and those two
plants were clearly going to have very
[SPEAKER_01]: different outcomes for patients and have
different therapeutic properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I really keyed into the fact that
the production environment was a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: variable, that the phenotypic diversity of
cannabis or the interaction between genes
[SPEAKER_01]: and the environment as a producer was
really as important to me as the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: genotype or the genetic material of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I began creating quadrants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had at the time three different medical
gardens I was associated with and would
[SPEAKER_01]: divide them into quadrants where I would
be trialing different sort of media,
[SPEAKER_01]: different lighting solutions, different
environmental conditions and producing
[SPEAKER_01]: analogies and political results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, I've always been involved
with hybridization and I say that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically not intentional plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not have known traits that I was
trying to kind of advance in the early
[SPEAKER_01]: days that had been on a team of friends
that had produced cultivars that were
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty famous in Portland in the early
2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really I was able to start to kind of
look at all of this genetic diversity and
[SPEAKER_01]: see that in addition to the variables of
the environment that the genes really
[SPEAKER_01]: mattered as well and that both of those
have become, you know, this long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: exploration that I'm just really grateful
to have had with the resources and time
[SPEAKER_01]: and partners to be able to work with all
in the hopes of eventually being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a spectrum of products that really
are targeted to particular patient
[SPEAKER_01]: outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, many people are talking in
those terms now, but I had about eight
[SPEAKER_01]: years of data prior to the advent of like
analytical testing as a result of
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance testing in the regulated
cannabis industry and had worked with so
[SPEAKER_01]: many diverse environments that there
really was a lot of insight about what
[SPEAKER_01]: these environments and the role that
things like what kind of, were you using
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral salt fertilizers or were you
using, you know, living organic soil
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you using a variety of different
organic inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you running, you know, high VPD or
low VPD strategies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have high pressure sodiums or in
the old days were you flowering under even
[SPEAKER_01]: metal halides?
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking at all of these variables,
I sort of had low level observational
[SPEAKER_01]: study data that was able to help me to
start to key into trends where I could
[SPEAKER_01]: optimize the expression of cannabinoids
and terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was really exciting was over the
course of time, using this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback, I was able as a producer to
really become much more sophisticated in
[SPEAKER_01]: harnessing high levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that there was a group of us
that were growing a dog walker,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, and I think only about five
of us had that plant for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was easily one of the most
important therapeutic plants that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: working with, especially for oncology
patients, people with chronic pain and
[SPEAKER_01]: people who needed really strong effect and
were looking for kind of relaxing,
[SPEAKER_01]: calming effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that as I was sort of competing
with the other producers who are our
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, I mean, I definitely was sitting
extreme levels and was able to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: like the most terpenes I've ever seen in a
lab results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was all through the course of
kind of getting insights into
[SPEAKER_01]: observational studies and optimizing the
production environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, in those variables,
you mentioned photo X, one of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that stood out after nutrition environment
that was probably the most singular
[SPEAKER_01]: important variable was lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the quality of lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I was able to
start to experiment with was using the
[SPEAKER_01]: very first generation of LEDs that were
available with custom spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ordered these bars that would have
like deep purples and violet lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I witnessed a complete transformation
in the morphology as I use different
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting spectra and lighting intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the evolution of lighting,
I've really written all the way from like
[SPEAKER_01]: there was literally mercury vapor bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that turned into metal halides and
fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later single ended HPS lights and
then double ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I noticed is when the lights
shifted from single ended HPS to double
[SPEAKER_01]: ended HPS, suddenly there was an explosion
and kind of more resonance cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: higher potency cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was very clear that the lighting was
a giant differentiating factor and
[SPEAKER_01]: producers who didn't have access to the
HVAC equipment or the ceiling height or
[SPEAKER_01]: the various things that required double
ended HPS to perform well, simply had a
[SPEAKER_01]: competitive advantage that was massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that same kind of theme is
happening with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure we'll talk about this a
little bit later, but that ultimately LEDs
[SPEAKER_01]: have provided a massive competitive
advantage for those who can understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: to unlock the power of using targeted
wavelength and much more intense lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: and much more consistent lighting and
dimmable lighting, as well as directional
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just full of advantages,
but in any case, all of this put into
[SPEAKER_01]: motion allows for me to create a range of
products that I felt stood out and were
[SPEAKER_01]: really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was getting that feedback from
patients that I was working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the genesis of the ideas behind
the dispensary I co-founded with my
[SPEAKER_01]: partner Sam Heywood called Pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharma is a dispensary in Portland,
it's spelled with an S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea was, you know, we're really
excited about whole plant cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be sophisticated in
representing and curating those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really took almost all of my sort of
initial vision for how that product mix
[SPEAKER_01]: should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Curated based on the early research of Dr.
Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also traveled to Israel and met
chemists like Womir and spent time with
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor Moshulam and a variety of other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really Ethan Russo who I think
gave me the tools to understand that in
[SPEAKER_01]: that first paper, the Taming THC paper I'd
read, there was 15 compounds he'd looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at and was giving them a particular value
and that we wanted to be able to curate
[SPEAKER_01]: from that perspective as opposed to a kind
of pseudoscience Indica and Sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective or a lot of the other language
and misnomers that came along with a
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition era and cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, for example, tested everything at
the dispensary through one lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: through Sunrise Analytical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually produced all 24 cultivars that
we had for roughly the first year and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half while we were still a medical
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was unable to continue to keep up
once we became a adult use dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we then had to bring in a lot of
different producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during that first year and a half,
it felt like something magical happened
[SPEAKER_01]: where we were the only dispensary in the
world at the time to post terpene data and
[SPEAKER_01]: to both feature overall terpene output as
well as specific terpene content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came up with an algorithm that
essentially was able to sort out what all
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers were coming in with,
which was this notion of Indica and Sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: and being able to sort of put on a
spectrum with six points, relaxing and
[SPEAKER_01]: calming effects on one side, focusing and
performance effects on the other with a
[SPEAKER_01]: weak, medium, and strong gradation for
each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, this is as much art as science
because the science of looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: ensemble or entourage effect at the time
and even now is, of course, far behind
[SPEAKER_01]: where we ideally want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk in some depth, especially with
new publications by Dr. Russo and others,
[SPEAKER_01]: about the individual components and some
of the drug interactions, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
insights that are still elusive that we
[SPEAKER_01]: need to understand the really complicated
effects with these whole plants is simply
[SPEAKER_01]: not mature yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it felt important to sort of draw a
line in the sand and say the prohibition
[SPEAKER_01]: era is coming to an end and it's time to
really honor and respect this plant in the
[SPEAKER_01]: way that we can sort of like share the
diversity and nuance of traits and without
[SPEAKER_01]: making a comparison to alcohol,
look a bit like other craft industries and
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to sort of make it more useful to
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Further, we insisted that everybody we
worked with, and I was really at the lead
[SPEAKER_01]: of this in the beginning, became highly
trained and professional in representing a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based vision of how to apply
cannabis therapeutics and work with
[SPEAKER_01]: products like RSO, and especially with
people who are late-stage oncology or
[SPEAKER_01]: end-of-life care or seizure disorders or
some of the most important kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients we were serving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was just a miracle that I
met Sam Heywood, who had the unbelievable
[SPEAKER_01]: business acumen and marketing ideas and
strategies to be able to kind of help
[SPEAKER_01]: pharma to bloom in this way that became a
really unique resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really attracted a lot of
attention, had national and international
[SPEAKER_01]: media, had just a lot of support for this
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we worked our faces off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally was working seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would often do more than 12 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were many 16-hour days back-to-back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be on my feet the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually that sort of led to kind of
burnout around trying to operate gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: and work with patients and operate the
dispensary and being a tiny team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Sam really, with the rest of the
pharma team, has continued operations with
[SPEAKER_01]: pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I took some reflective time and
worked to establish a garden that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: a bigger scale garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you know, Ted, I love your
podcast and I'm so grateful to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: because one of the things that you have
done has helped to really emphasize and
[SPEAKER_01]: underline the importance of ecological
production and sophisticated perspectives
[SPEAKER_01]: around organic crop production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that's really,
really near and dear to my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that if at scale this whole
industry employed the kinds of practices
[SPEAKER_01]: that you espouse and many people on your
show have brought forward, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately we'd take a bite out of climate
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd take all kinds of sort of
sequestering of atmospheric carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: practices into motion that would even
further influence agriculture and
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture on the whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's just so many
wonderful aspects to this notion that
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative farming is really going to
make a huge contribution to the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: life on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also know there's another priority
that has probably even become more
[SPEAKER_01]: important for my personal work.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I've gone down this path, I really want
to be able to create targeted,
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent, chemical varieties that are
reliable for patients and that illustrate
[SPEAKER_01]: a path towards being able to have a
long-term relationship with whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant-derived phytochemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not simply, you know, leave the sort
of really serious patients in the hands of
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical companies that are
developing, you know, through clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trial work, maybe sort of single varieties
of cannabis chemistry and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide even from a synthetic cannabinoid
perspective, you know, totally consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds, but that are not being produced
from a plant or are being greatly refined
[SPEAKER_01]: after being reproduced from a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have always had, and even more
so now than ever, have just unshakable
[SPEAKER_01]: belief that there is wisdom in a plant
that is sort of more than we can quantify
[SPEAKER_01]: with an analytical testing result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly at the resolution of
analytical testing, we're at now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that there is also a folk medicine
revolution aspect to relying on whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, which means that really we're in a
situation where people internationally can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow plants and take care of their
wellbeing and take care of their family
[SPEAKER_01]: and loved ones and communities' wellbeing
with plants and not be entirely reliant on
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical companies to be able to
provide that relief, but that we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to become very mature quickly to
be able to command some part of the market
[SPEAKER_01]: share and to inspire and illustrate a path
forward where people can continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: relate with this ancient plant in a really
meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in modern times, find the kinds of
health benefits they would expect to find
[SPEAKER_01]: from even pharmaceutical drugs,
but without having to go through that
[SPEAKER_01]: entire part of the, I guess, that part of
the economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that said, I've become increasingly
focused on targeted chemo bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was trying to build a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to be called Nucleus
Nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would essentially balance the
ecological crop production methods with
[SPEAKER_01]: targeted chemo, chemical varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that actually, after raising a lot of
money, quite a lot of money, a big team
[SPEAKER_01]: and being a CEO and a year and a half of
development, that effort was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit in the campus called the OHUB,
which is the Oregon science and research
[SPEAKER_01]: campus that Philos Bioscience,
Cascadia Analytics, and a few other
[SPEAKER_01]: partners were going to have on some land
south of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, or actually in
hindsight, very fortunately, shortly
[SPEAKER_01]: before Trump got elected, it was clear
that things were starting to go away from
[SPEAKER_01]: an Obama era into an era that looked less
supportive of the cannabis economy to
[SPEAKER_01]: flourish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sort of had to deal with dissolving a
company because the landlords and the
[SPEAKER_01]: investors started getting cold feet and
things got shaky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really for about eight to nine
months, I ended up having to dissolve
[SPEAKER_01]: Nucleus Nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a really hard time for me
because I'd worked with people from around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world to create what I felt would be
the most ecological production environment
[SPEAKER_01]: that had ever happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking about like 12 acres of
solar panels to run an all LED,
[SPEAKER_01]: super high tech glass house that was based
on Dutch greenhouse design that had a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of considerations, epic scale
rainwater attachments and regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil program and a sort of food
forest and polyculture landscape that was
[SPEAKER_01]: featured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, there was this whole vision that
was very compelling and I had completely
[SPEAKER_01]: bought in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after it had to be dissolved,
actually that was the best thing that ever
[SPEAKER_01]: could have happened to me because that
effort wouldn't have been able to survive
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Oregon market as the market has
shaken out with massive overproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really as a producer, your survival
depends on being able to access shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: space and retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I became a consultant for a period of
time and my partner Sam and I founded a
[SPEAKER_01]: company called Agonist Consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agonist then engaged with the now governor
of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, and I became
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in sort of emerging regulatory
markets after having had paid dues already
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Oregon market, which I didn't
mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on the OLCC, just the Oregon Liquor
and Control Commission rulemaking advisory
[SPEAKER_01]: committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked with the governor, worked with
the mayor, I worked with members of
[SPEAKER_01]: Congress, I worked with a congressman Earl
Blumenauer and actually co-founded the
[SPEAKER_01]: very first regenerative cannabis event
with Congressman Earl Blumenauer and in
[SPEAKER_01]: partnership with the Willamette Week
started an event that was really meant to
[SPEAKER_01]: support sort of the kinds of insights that
are what you're curating on your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually become the largest
craft cannabis event in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really doing some exciting things
I'd like to talk more about, but I'll stop
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll save that for another subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had a lot of experience with sort of
working to try to find a way to bring the
[SPEAKER_01]: best ethics and practices forward for this
emerging industry that I cared so much
[SPEAKER_01]: about and to also try to protect the craft
producers and the people who were clearly
[SPEAKER_01]: in a position that looked like they were
going to be left behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a lot of battles and some of
that got played out in the consultancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I landed a client that is called
Groundworks Industries that owns
[SPEAKER_01]: ProofCultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was the most fateful moment in my
story because really ProofCultivar is a
[SPEAKER_01]: very high tech facility in northeast
Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all controlled environment,
sort of precision ag modeled environments
[SPEAKER_01]: that has 16 different chambers that are
tightly controlled and that allow for my
[SPEAKER_01]: original work back to testing
environmental strategies and huge amounts
[SPEAKER_01]: of genetic diversity and working with
hybridization to really do this work at
[SPEAKER_01]: scale in a mature way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really just been a dream come
true where rather than having to manage
[SPEAKER_01]: investor expectations, now there's people
who are really sophisticated at that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can deal with that task.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rather than having to do all these
other things that I had to do as a CEO for
[SPEAKER_01]: Nucleus, I found a team that was really
strong and able to support me to do what I
[SPEAKER_01]: most wanted to do, which was to go back to
solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw at Pharma, which was there is a huge
amount of product consistency issues in
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product variability that I worked with
at the time would mean that if I was
[SPEAKER_01]: working with a patient and they found just
some miraculous curative relationship with
[SPEAKER_01]: a very particular team of ours,
and really whether they were using flour
[SPEAKER_01]: or concentrate, if they were to come back
a month later, it was almost inconceivable
[SPEAKER_01]: that even if we had the exact same hemavar
or rather the same flour, it was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: feature the same chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just saw a huge continuing diversity in
the expression of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really wanted to be able to
provision patients with something that was
[SPEAKER_01]: more consistent and closer to being
research grade, because to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the critical line in the sand we
have to cross to enter into a more mature
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with the patients that we
seek to serve.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to be able to consistently produce a
diversity of phytochemistry that's
[SPEAKER_01]: maximally useful and therapeutic and life
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been working on that project at
Proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost been two years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've finally produced some really
great results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just amazing what we're doing
in this facility where I've founded a team
[SPEAKER_01]: called Innovation Lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are three main focuses in my
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And effort at this point to make this
research grade output.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that producers everywhere
would be wise to be thinking about these
[SPEAKER_01]: variables above many others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first variable is to be able to do
a phenotype discovery at scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to audition a huge amount of
genetic diversity, knowing how diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is as being the most outbred
plant in history, being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: accommodate the unique needs of all these
different plants, but to just audition in
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of a thousand, all of these different
seeds that ultimately we're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: from high level resolution genomic
science, like 50,000 genotype SNPs for
[SPEAKER_01]: every plant, a machine learning platform
called Proof OS that I've designed with a
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really mature data science team from
Big Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's helped me to create an environmental
control system that essentially has sensor
[SPEAKER_01]: arrays in every environment and it's
tracking all factors related to plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth in a pretty dense sensor array that
gives really clear visibility to real time
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental experience, trending data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where the machine learning comes in is
to correlate all the way between genotype
[SPEAKER_01]: to chemotype, these interactions between
our cultural practices and all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking my early low throughput
phenotyping or low throughput phenotyping
[SPEAKER_01]: into a more high throughput phenotyping
mode, it's been one of the most exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: things about being at Proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first discipline is really
phenotype discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that builds the palette of traits
that we're working on in our breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a variety of partners that
we're working with, but Phyllis Bioscience
[SPEAKER_01]: is the most important one for the
phenotype discovery work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're participating in a breeder's
innovation network that they've helped to
[SPEAKER_01]: facilitate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a really exciting
collaborative approach with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: ethics to kind of build an unbelievable
new plant stock and both from agronomic
[SPEAKER_01]: perspectives and chemotypic perspectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second discipline that is a core
focus for the Innovation Lab is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: called photobiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned photo X.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one neat little fact is that Nick
Clays, who is a founder and CEO,
[SPEAKER_01]: past CEO for Fluence Bioengineering from
Austin, Texas, was up visiting me in
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland with his partner, Jerry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one night in front of my driveway in a
rental car, you're doing the same thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: often do and kind of rattling on about
chemotypes and the importance of that and
[SPEAKER_01]: how their technology was intrinsic and to
unlock that potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nick founded that night, the photo X
conference, which has also had four years
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And photo X became an invite only really
special conference where brilliant
[SPEAKER_01]: academic resources could come into the
cannabis conversation because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: framed as a photobiology conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would actually have like people from
very high level universities working on
[SPEAKER_01]: non-cannabis research that was relevant to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like looking at carotenoid
research, which is a secondary metabolite
[SPEAKER_01]: that's important if you're concerned with
nutrition and produce and how that relates
[SPEAKER_01]: to photobiology or to the effect of light
on life really, but specifically looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at wavelengths and the different
functions, wavelengths of light are
[SPEAKER_01]: playing as well as the intensity of light
and exploring for the first time with
[SPEAKER_01]: these cutting edge fixtures that allow for
us to really, in a very precise way,
[SPEAKER_01]: use wavelengths strategically to optimize
plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, NASA has been doing some work
on photobiology since I believe the late
[SPEAKER_01]: sixties, early seventies for space travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been all sorts of early
assumptions like red and blue light or
[SPEAKER_01]: only two wavelengths that are or that are
principally associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we've gone into a much more
complicated world now where we understand
[SPEAKER_01]: that all spectra of light interacts with
both plant morphology and phytochemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: production in very interesting ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at Proof, we have two different
chambers that are being used and it's sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of single factor variable research to
illustrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, we're working on the impact of
far red light being included in a broad
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum fixture versus more of a near red
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you were at PhotoX this
year and we had the kind of godfather of
[SPEAKER_01]: photobiology, Bruce Bugby from University
of Salt Lake there and he was presenting
[SPEAKER_01]: his findings about the inclusion of far
red light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this turns out to be a massive
variable where he's seen things in basal
[SPEAKER_01]: crops and has reproduced this work with
other scientists that you could like
[SPEAKER_01]: increase that little bit of far red light
and then greatly decrease all of the rest
[SPEAKER_01]: of the PPFD or the photosynthetic photon
flux density and still see increased
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass production and increased secondary
metabolite formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a big deal because we're always
working towards in controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is peak efficiency look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we reduce our carbon footprint to
the absolute smallest it can be?
[SPEAKER_01]: But for those of us who are focusing more
in on a kind of biopharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective and needing to have consistent
chemistry, needing to use these controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: environments is absolutely imperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diversity in field grown cannabis is
pretty tremendous and I'm in love with it
[SPEAKER_01]: and I love to consume it myself and want
that to be the lion's share of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's a very special place
for these kind of more targeted solutions
[SPEAKER_01]: that the LEDs can provide, but energy
becomes the biggest concern and
[SPEAKER_01]: consideration, which is why I've been on
the technical advisory committee for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Resource Innovation Institute and RAI has
been working to really, for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time, map the footprint of producers and
to become very fine tooth comb analyzing
[SPEAKER_01]: the producer's inputs, especially related
to lighting and HVAC and both for indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: and outdoor producers as well as
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been really useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But bottom line is this new research in
photobiology is illustrating a path by
[SPEAKER_01]: which we can use greatly less energy which
of course LEDs compared to high intensity
[SPEAKER_01]: discharge fixtures greatly reduced the
overall energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean something like 50% less energy than
the thousand watt HPS for our current LED
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions and 40% less energy for the HVAC
because we have way less thermal load.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you add dimming in,
which we use lots of dimming so that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: using targeted UMOL or targeted PPFT for
different developmental stages,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see a net reduction around like 70 to
80% beyond a thousand watt HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at our footprint as a
facility at proof, we only have about
[SPEAKER_01]: 7,000 square foot of blooming canopy,
even though we're in a 60,000 square foot
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled environment warehouse with all
these chambers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a much smaller carbon footprint
than all kinds of other industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouses that are our neighbors and our
close proximity in Northeast Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm proud of where we've gotten to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I promise that in the very near
future, we're going to go much farther
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to combine with batteries and
photovoltaics and even more efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: light emitting solutions like the newest
generation of fluence tech, like the Viper
[SPEAKER_01]: 2s and Spider 2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets to a point where you really,
really are using nominal amounts of power
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to provide these rich
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's actually not the most exciting
part of photobiology, although it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really important theme for me and for I
know a lot of the people who listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But probably more exciting is really that
we can greatly affect morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the structure of the plant,
which when you're dealing with plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: are very compact and very lanky and a
spectrum and you want compact plants in an
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor environment that allow for you to
have consistent canopies with as little
[SPEAKER_01]: intervention as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lighting can play a very significant role.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the structure of plants, clearly broad
spectrum from very early on has resulted
[SPEAKER_01]: in just a level of vigor that is like what
you'd expect to see in a sun-grown crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike relying exclusively on orange light
from HPS fixtures, which never look quite
[SPEAKER_01]: like sun-grown crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the most exciting piece is the
phytochemistry and it's what's happening
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing really fascinating things
with using broad spectrum wavelengths,
[SPEAKER_01]: the inclusion of specifically green light
to create broad spectrum and fill out what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're often missing in the other
fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, one of the interesting
things is my best data around terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: production from the early research and all
of the garage and basements actually
[SPEAKER_01]: illustrated that ceramic metal halides
were producing the best terpenes of any
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting solution that we had access to at
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, ceramic metal halides are kind
of an old technology, again, relying on
[SPEAKER_01]: gas-filled bulbs that are really not
consistent in their expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moment you plug them in, like any
other gas-filled bulb, it's already on a
[SPEAKER_01]: gradation where you're losing intensity as
well as wavelength.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you want to go further,
they're using a lot of electricity and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're producing a lot of heat and
they're distributing light in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: needs reflectors that's not directional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't dim them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's all these huge issues,
but those were by far the best terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: producing lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we worked to emulate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the physio-spec spectrum that
you see influences really emulating that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but now we're going well beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that what we're doing at PROOF will
illustrate paths forward for targeted
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochemistry paired with particular
cultivars and cultural practices and
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental strategies that become
relevant recipes for chemical varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So photobiology, given that light,
once everything else is in balance,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would argue is likely the most important
variable, the quality of light and the
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity of light, as well as the
consistency of light in producing
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent chemophores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get dragged into this
discipline if you're a careful cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: producer and want to know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to learn a lot about physics and
light, it turns out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So photobiology is the second discipline
in the Innovation Lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third discipline is the one most true
to your podcast, which is that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate about organic crop production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked a lot with living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the blessing of working with some
incredible people as I have worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: all sorts of different raised beds and
shared root zones and hyper-complex
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizospheres that required no additional
nutrient input beyond green mulch and some
[SPEAKER_01]: teas and have really worked with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had about four years experience with
living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some of the best cannabis I've ever
produced in my life unquestionably come
[SPEAKER_01]: out of living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've also had some major crashes where
I was even with my best resources and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: calling on people that are brilliant and a
lot of resources present and trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: analytics and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have literally watched an entire garden
just crash and burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, I know that we are much more
sophisticated thanks to you and many other
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are on the frontier of
educating and bringing popular education
[SPEAKER_01]: and around the dynamics of working with
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet still I realized that proof I
needed a kind of a modified approach that
[SPEAKER_01]: is unfortunately currently producing a bit
of effluence in that we are not reusing
[SPEAKER_01]: our media.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are custom mixing all of our own
organic inputs and we do some very
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific process to organize our organic
crop production in a way as close to
[SPEAKER_01]: really consistent, reliable results as
possible so that whenever I'm interacting
[SPEAKER_01]: with scientists who say, come on,
if you're doing that kind of research,
[SPEAKER_01]: the only way you'll establish a meaningful
baseline is to use mineral salt
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am adamantly opposed to using
mineral salt fertilizers other than in
[SPEAKER_01]: very limited expressions for very
particular kinds of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general for our product,
it's just imperative to me that be both
[SPEAKER_01]: clean, green certified and go way beyond
what most people consider normal organics
[SPEAKER_01]: and then go more into a precision ag
modality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how I've chosen to do that with this
incredible team at proof is really to test
[SPEAKER_01]: each individual input.
[SPEAKER_01]: We source most of the things that we can
locally and then we actually do analytics
[SPEAKER_01]: through a lab in South Florida called QAL.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's quick turnaround, really
affordable, big ag lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we test the inputs consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we custom mix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And currently we're still hand mixing for
our whole facility, although we're
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing on automation for the mixing over
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we measure the substrate,
the leachate, and those are two
[SPEAKER_01]: independent things that we're testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we can, which is not always
consistent right now, we measure the
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking at micro and macro
availability of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're able to through all four of
those analytical processes, which has not
[SPEAKER_01]: been cheap and has been a huge blessing to
be able to finally get insight into.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are getting really, really good at
understanding what particular chemophars
[SPEAKER_01]: need to flourish and learning that there
is a broad range of diversity in the
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions we need to employ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we have a fertigation system
that took me seven months to design where
[SPEAKER_01]: we do apply some liquid nutrients that are
of course all organic, but that allow for
[SPEAKER_01]: us to deal with some of the crop diversity
issues where there's never a one size fits
[SPEAKER_01]: all solution in our facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really targeting four groups of
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're grouped together by length of
maturing time, which is one huge variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compact and lanky plants is another access
by which to look at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also looking at specific nutritional
requirements outside of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you obviously have a longer
maturing plant versus a short maturing
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, that changes the schedule of
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But further, there are plants that we
found that are clearly more acid loving
[SPEAKER_01]: and plants that are more base loving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants that need, in our six part dolomite
line input, more of the medium grade,
[SPEAKER_01]: less of the fine grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: These sort of strategies that don't result
on the classic put more CalMag in,
[SPEAKER_01]: this one just needs that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like actually formulate in a targeted
way from our initial media mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: the lion's share of what the plant will
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do that for all of these groups of
plants in this complex facility where we
[SPEAKER_01]: could be between 14 and 22,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being able to use analytics to validate
the nutrition and availability of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition as the fundament, and then to
work on enhancing that with biology
[SPEAKER_01]: through a variety of practices has been
the sort of mainstay of our organic crop
[SPEAKER_01]: production program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the third point of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a really excellent
in-house soil scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's on our team named Meg Hausman,
who's been doing that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person who's actually leading R&D for
me for the Innovation Lab is an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: plant scientist named Kylie Mendoza.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've got some increasing
scientific prowess working together along
[SPEAKER_01]: with Lee Nye, our grower, and Todd Saucy,
our operating director.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's been incredible is having this
facility that can essentially facilitate
[SPEAKER_01]: all three kinds of research that I've just
described at scale as we are a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that as I've brought my own plants
into the facility, which are things that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working on hybridizing based on
analytical results, and I've developed
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of cultural practices and
environmental targets for over the last
[SPEAKER_01]: decade, we are seeing amazing results,
Todd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of which I just texted you earlier
today, because I was happy to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of 2019, a review of the best
smoke in Oregon of 2018, and to happen to
[SPEAKER_01]: see two of the five reviews about new
chemovars that we've produced,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of which is a type two plant,
which I believe people should be ready for
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that type twos are going to be
far more desirable in coming years than I
[SPEAKER_01]: think type ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently you see high THC plants
receiving the most attention in the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial market, but type two plants are
unbelievably versatile in that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: produce a huge range of sort of ratios of
THC and CBD as the engine of this plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then bring in really novel chemical
varieties by crashing type ones into type
[SPEAKER_01]: threes and so forth, because type threes
and twos are vastly less likely to be
[SPEAKER_01]: bottlenecked right now in the way that
type ones are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a notion that when you're
selecting plants for hybridization in a
[SPEAKER_01]: population of less than 200, you're going
to create a genetic bottleneck that
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially is losing a huge amount of
traits that are very important if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeking to adapt to changing times or make
these new, vigorous, early-maturing,
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen-resistant, exciting chemovars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that type twos actually have
been winning cups secretly, like there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: story that Ethan Russo told me recently
about the rainbow gummies that won in a
[SPEAKER_01]: type one category, a high THC category in
the Emerald Cup was by far the most
[SPEAKER_01]: desired cultivar, and it was a terpenaline
dominant type two, which is rare because
[SPEAKER_01]: most type twos and type threes are myrcine
dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a less relaxing, sedative form
of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And similarly, Astral Works has become a
real people's choice in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been written up as the best CBD
product and Leafly and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, Astral Works is a terpenaline
dominant anthracyanin flush, like a deep,
[SPEAKER_01]: deep purple, brilliant flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like nothing I've smelled
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in that hazy, terpenaline,
just perfused brightness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's also an unbelievably
vigorous, heavy-yielding, early-maturing
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got an array of other compounds,
like a minor cannabidiol varine,
[SPEAKER_01]: a CBDV feature, and a lot of terpene
diversity and intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming in very high oil, over 3% oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in any case, these are things that are
starting to be accepted in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It otherwise is driven to my horror
entirely by THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at BBS analytical data,
which is the best market-based analytical
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective on what products are selling
in Oregon, California, Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, you really see in Oregon,
people are buying and paying more for high
[SPEAKER_01]: THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem with this is that in the
biosynthes of these cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenoids, you actually have a shared
pathway between the path that produces
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids in the plant from glucose and
the path that produces terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the geranopyrophosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have limited resources to
make all these drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're choosing, do we send all of those
resources to this one note that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: make synthetically, or that looks like
Marinal or just these huge THC products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you diversify and start sending more
of that energy towards terpenoid
[SPEAKER_01]: production and more polychemical
perspectives?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one day soon, we're not just going
to be talking about terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking about aldehydes,
esters, ketones, flavonoids, and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the other important therapeutic agents
that this plant is so willing to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bottom line is I'm excited to see
some consumer awareness growing around the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that it's very likely you will have
more pleasure and much better effects from
[SPEAKER_01]: the next-gen type two plants coming online
after the amazing work of people like
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawrence Ringo of SOHUM and Jamie from
Resin, and people who have really changed
[SPEAKER_01]: the world by bringing type threes back and
type twos back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I expect in the main retail sector,
as people start to get more sophisticated,
[SPEAKER_01]: type twos are going to play a much bigger
role because they're just very desirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're seeing, in addition to really
exciting type twos like Astroworks,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, by the way, a hybrid they
produced from a tangerine haze male that
[SPEAKER_01]: was unbelievably vigorous and imparted
terpenoline and vigor and anthracyanin to
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that I was using that in the
hybrid with, and worked with Lawrence
[SPEAKER_01]: Ringo's Harley Sue, which was the
earliest-maturing, heaviest-yielding,
[SPEAKER_01]: most desirable type three flower I
personally found after auditioning
[SPEAKER_01]: something like 25 varieties in a year and
a half, and just is something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: worked really well for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The particular variety I had clearly had
the CBDV feature, working with CBDV
[SPEAKER_01]: seizure disorder patients, the inclusion
of CBDV clearly, anecdotally, increased
[SPEAKER_01]: the odds of efficacy and success in
working to suppress the frequency of
[SPEAKER_01]: seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that plant is, I just think,
a legendary plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then being able to create this hybrid,
this was exactly the outcome I was looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a bridge between those worlds and
have a type two that is not mere seen
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant and that it's just amazingly
useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also seeing just in terpene
production in the type ones, huge
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the problems with measuring
terpenes is that we have a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: inter-lab variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Oregon, we have a program called Or
Lap, which is meant to govern the labs and
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure consistency in the approach and
process that they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back to Pat Marshall, one of the
amazing things that he did was resolved to
[SPEAKER_01]: use a method, 8270, which is the,
it's a method that's been used by the EPA
[SPEAKER_01]: for measuring organic solvents for more
than 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very mature method with lots of
redundancy and quality control built into
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he used a great method.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the three things I think are
important when you're looking at a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the level of experience and the
credibility of the practitioner?
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, what method are they using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three, what equipment are they
using?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when you get sophisticated at
looking at those three variables,
[SPEAKER_01]: you find that actually even in the
regulated economy, there are a lot of labs
[SPEAKER_01]: that I do not consider to be passing
muster.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Pat was special in that he had a great
method, was unbelievably experienced.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was mainly focused on GC at the time,
which is why we got such great terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom line is the range of what
terpenes are being reported, it varies
[SPEAKER_01]: widely, but I'm seeing anywhere between an
average sample in the market or in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation classic data is produced with
160 entries from some of the most skilled
[SPEAKER_01]: producers in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: An average of like maybe one, one and a
half percent oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider 2% and up to be high oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider the cultivars coming out of
proof to be among the highest I've
[SPEAKER_01]: personally seen in the market using
Cascadia Analytics as our baseline,
[SPEAKER_01]: who have demonstrated a pretty visionary
approach to being market leaders and now
[SPEAKER_01]: both in California as well as in Oregon,
providing a pretty unique approach to QC
[SPEAKER_01]: for producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've not seen anything over 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am seeing in our varieties, about a
third of our current varieties that are
[SPEAKER_01]: new ones that I've bred in the four to 5%
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hitting as high oil as I've seen,
and these are plants when you harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: them, literally like plastic gloves,
you just see oil all over your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that really desirable and the
effects are really quite strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we think about high THC in a way,
actually for anybody who was at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Cup this year, or who wasn't
there, you should go online and look at
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Mark Lewis's talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just did a brilliant, simple sort
of expression of what's happened in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry with chemovars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that over the years we have
been more successful at producing higher
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not just through breeding,
by the way, that was through light
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity and production environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to evoke that because I've
been able to evoke very high THC from
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred lines or land race cultivars that
were clearly not as intensively
[SPEAKER_01]: hybridized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just by adding really intense light,
I was seeing lots of THC and very little
[SPEAKER_01]: other compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as that's happened, we've seen
consumers have increasingly negative
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know that we're really good at
serving this core super user market,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what the existing product mix is
kind of dominated by.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being able to expand into this utility
where we're more effective at serving,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, more women than men, because right
now, if you look at the BDS market data,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're actually losing women.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the regulated market is growing,
we're serving less women than we were
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really big issue if you look at
the fact that everybody stands to benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: who has an endocannabinoid system from
using cannabis products that are well
[SPEAKER_01]: formulated and balanced and interesting in
their profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some reason, our product mix is
driving women away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be more effective in
serving aging boomers and this kind of end
[SPEAKER_01]: of life population and all of these other
populations when we cease to only have
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of high THC metric.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are many ways to ameliorate the
negative effects of the psychoactivity of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, which I love THC and I'm a happy type
one consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love type twos and threes as
well, but I've always consumed type ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really concerned that if we don't
produce more terpenes, which is a great
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy to change and affect the
expression of the THC for the patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: or more cannabidiol rich cultivars or more
minor cannabinoid featured cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we're simply not making the right
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the world needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world needs a diverse array of
products and that's a really important
[SPEAKER_01]: theme that I see going forward,
both at proof and for the industry on the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So gosh, can I just talk to you for a long
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that that was reasonably well
organized because I don't think you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to get it word and edge wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have so many questions for you,
but I know you're also out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to propose this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about if I saved my questions and
maybe had you back on another time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also opened it up to listeners to ask
some questions because you touched on so
[SPEAKER_00]: many really important topics ranging from
anything from terroir and chemo type
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to find out what generalizations
can you make based on the type of lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: or nutrients or methodology around growing
that you might be able to make for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this changed from high mercine plants
over time has affected patients or people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are using it for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down what chemo type expressions
are most beneficial for different uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so many questions I have for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and like how stress response may
affect chemotypic expression as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: one that I think that just is affecting
fascinating topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to save these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be OK to have you back on another
time when you have more time and we could
[SPEAKER_00]: just do a little quick short answer Q&A?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be honored, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to be on in the near future
when it works for both of us and have it
[SPEAKER_01]: be more and have it give you an
opportunity to respond to your questions
[SPEAKER_01]: and anybody else's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those questions you just
mentioned are really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, and it's a joy to have time with
you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you have a lot of other
exciting content coming, but I'm looking
[SPEAKER_01]: forward to chiming in in the future as
soon as you're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for your time
today, Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to coming down and
actually checking out proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after hearing more about it,
I really can't wait to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can't wait to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for everything you do,
Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the community that you bring
together around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for all of the inspiring visionary
solutions that are proposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly have gained a lot and really
appreciate the content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that a lot of other people do,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for all the work you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that was Jeremy Plumb, director of
production science at Proof Cultivar.
