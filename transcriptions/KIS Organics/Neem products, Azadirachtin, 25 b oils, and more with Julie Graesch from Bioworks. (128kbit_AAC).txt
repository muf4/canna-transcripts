[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so I'm here with Julie Gresh from
BioWorks and she did a presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday on neem and azadirachtin and I
put up a quick post on my story and there
[SPEAKER_00]: were a lot of questions about it so I
tracked her down and I thought we could do
[SPEAKER_00]: a little short little mini session on neem
and azadirachtin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for taking the time to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so why don't we start off with how
the neem tree gets processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a real quick explanation on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the seed, the fruit is small almost
olive shaped and as it progresses to
[SPEAKER_01]: maturity it goes this nice yellow orange
color and it will fall from the tree where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's harvested and the neem seed after the
fruit flesh has been removed you're left
[SPEAKER_01]: with the kernel and it does have a hole on
it which needs to be removed like a
[SPEAKER_01]: pistachio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once that's removed you get the kernel
or the seed which is either solvent
[SPEAKER_01]: extracted or also pressed to remove the
oil and from that oil you have the raw
[SPEAKER_01]: oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an additional process where it's
separated into two different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is azadirachtin and one is clarified
hydrophobic extract of neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since that's a lot of words and most
people don't like to say a lot of words it
[SPEAKER_01]: is shortened often down to just saying
neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to note that a
neem oil product does not have
[SPEAKER_01]: azadirachtin and an azadirachtin product
does not have neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: However there are some combo products that
may have both depending so it's important
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure you look at the label to
ensure that you are when you're wanting to
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase do you want a neem oil for
suffocation or do you want azadirachtin
[SPEAKER_01]: that will have additional insecticidal
capabilities and those neem oil products
[SPEAKER_01]: are typically formulated in an oil like a
sunflower oil and those will then help
[SPEAKER_01]: facilitate the the application and the
spread and the absorption of that chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: into the insect's cuticle which there can
be some contact efficacy but mainly it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be ingested for maximum efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the neem oil it's suffocation or
cuticle disruption which you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of that with the azadirachtin
products as well because oftentimes
[SPEAKER_01]: they're formulated in oil but not neem
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what what is uniquely special about
neem oil then compared to other oils if
[SPEAKER_00]: anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the neem oil comes from a botanical
source so you can have a product like soft
[SPEAKER_01]: oil X that is made from a horticultural
mineral oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is different than something that
is botanically produced so it's produced
[SPEAKER_01]: from something in nature the neem tree the
seed that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each of those can be highly efficacious
and will have their place and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes even use those in rotation just
depending on you know what your goals are
[SPEAKER_01]: and what insects may be on the label or
even what diseases or mites are on those
[SPEAKER_01]: labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again make sure you read the label
because not all of them will be targeting
[SPEAKER_01]: the same insect mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these products are also
fungicidal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say there are differences in
the oils and a reason you may choose say a
[SPEAKER_01]: neem oil over a horticultural mineral oil
is that it is plant-based and it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be more complex I would say than
something that is more of a pure mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: oil and there's going to be several
compounds that come from the tree with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again it's fundamentally different you
know from a horticultural mineral oil from
[SPEAKER_01]: a neem oil so try them both.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what works best for you sometimes like
I said they are used in rotation I
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't tank mix them but they can be
used in rotation especially if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to target specifically things that
are on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and neem oil is EPA regulated
products or registered products sorry and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these other oils like some of the
thyme products lavender those are all 25B
[SPEAKER_00]: products so there's a little more
regulation around neem as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct so your azadirachtin products your
neem products and your combo products will
[SPEAKER_01]: all be found listed at the environmental
protection agency EPA and there are a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of neem and azadirachtin based
products that do have hemp on the label
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can go onto the EPA website and
look for product search azadirachtin or
[SPEAKER_01]: neem oil or clarified hydrophobic extract
of neem oil and it should pull up in hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: and it should pull you up that short list
I think there's around 10 to 15 different
[SPEAKER_01]: labels that are listed on the EPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at the state level there may be
additional products that the states have
[SPEAKER_01]: approved for use so do look at your state
to see if you do have maybe more options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now as far as the 25Bs those are
considered safe by the NOP or National
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic Program and because those are
considered safe to humans and crops they
[SPEAKER_01]: have less regulations associated with them
many of them are essential oil based and
[SPEAKER_01]: as Tad said it could be thyme oil based or
peppermint oil rosemary oil sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll have a combination of many of these
different oils they do have an odor to
[SPEAKER_01]: them and they can work through not only
just the suffocation but you can also have
[SPEAKER_01]: some direct effects on the insects it may
disrupt you know some sort of insect
[SPEAKER_01]: physiology just depending on what oil
essential oil is in those 25B products
[SPEAKER_01]: there's also an odor associated with it
some people depending again on the
[SPEAKER_01]: essential oil can think that it is a
pleasant odor other people don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a pleasant odor that does seem to be
a little bit dependent on the people but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's not an offending like maybe a
chemical smell would be so but again those
[SPEAKER_01]: are 25B products and they're not
registered with the EPA so there are less
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations associated with them maybe
many of them don't even have a PPE
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements although I would always tell
you that it's important to wear PPE such
[SPEAKER_01]: as gloves while making the application
maybe just like a dust mask or something
[SPEAKER_01]: so you're not inhaling particles and that
sort of thing safety should always be
[SPEAKER_01]: first when dealing with any kind of spray
so in addition to the suffocation or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of physiological effects with
the insects that odor can make insects not
[SPEAKER_01]: also not like it and so they may disappear
they may try to go to a different plant
[SPEAKER_01]: they may leave the if it's a greenhouse if
it's a grow obviously you know there's
[SPEAKER_01]: only so far for them to go but they may
not come back to the plant so they would
[SPEAKER_01]: then at that point starve so there's a
neem oil might have that effect too
[SPEAKER_00]: because it has a very pungent odor and one
thing on 25B products I want to mention is
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no requirement for any efficacy
data on them so I could mix in my garage
[SPEAKER_00]: rosemary oil and peppermint oil and slap
it on a label and make a product and
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much say that it kills these things
but I don't have to actually prove any
[SPEAKER_00]: private data so as a consumer you just
have to be very careful absolutely and
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you for bringing that up what you
could do what you just said and however
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that produce 25Bs have
scientists research and development that
[SPEAKER_01]: formulate these products together and have
very specific ratios and there is for
[SPEAKER_01]: reputable companies there is or should be
some research and development that has
[SPEAKER_01]: been done to ensure that you have a good
emulsion of the essential oils with
[SPEAKER_01]: various formulation components that is
going to make a good product and most
[SPEAKER_01]: importantly that that product will not say
burn the crop or cause any other correct
[SPEAKER_01]: phytotoxicity crop tolerance and
potentially a number of other things and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's obviously really important you
don't want to burn your crop so if you mix
[SPEAKER_01]: something up in your own basement and try
to apply it to your plant it may not mix
[SPEAKER_01]: in water very well it may want to just
float right up to the surface a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these essential oils are very volatile and
so if you put it into water it may just
[SPEAKER_01]: volatilize and go poof so many of these
essential oils have been formulated to
[SPEAKER_01]: almost encapsulate the essential essential
oil so it doesn't volatilize until it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: to the plant where it's going to have that
efficacy so it's more complicated than
[SPEAKER_01]: just putting some of these things together
and applying it to your plant there are
[SPEAKER_01]: dangers with doing that and I think mainly
crop damage being the biggest concern so
[SPEAKER_00]: getting back to the neem stuff here we
carry a cold pressed neem product my
[SPEAKER_00]: company Kiss Organics you don't know that
but we do and one of the things around
[SPEAKER_00]: that is you mentioned it does have a level
it can't potentially have levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: azadirachtin I know originally I had the
manufacturer send me stuff and it showed
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the ppm of azadirachtin in the
product so when you said neem oil didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: contain azadirachtin that kind of
surprised me and then you mentioned this
[SPEAKER_00]: cold pressing so I guess my question
around that is the neem cake and the neem
[SPEAKER_00]: oil if it's cold pressed will have some
azadirachtin level but it'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially lower than the pure
azadirachtin product is that correct so
[SPEAKER_01]: the the cold pressed neem is basically
that kernel that we talked about earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: it's pressed the seed or the kernel is
about 40% oil so with that comes all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the the limonoid compounds that are in
there and azadirachtin is actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: collective term because it is botanical
you have more than just azadirachtin
[SPEAKER_01]: azadirachtin is the most insecticidally
active and highest concentration of those
[SPEAKER_01]: various compounds that is now known as
azadirachtin so you get depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed quality you can have anywhere from
300 to I think 2,500 parts per million
[SPEAKER_01]: azadirachtin from a cold pressed neem oil
or the raw neem oil and so for instance
[SPEAKER_01]: with an azadirachtin product it can be
anywhere from 0.15 or less if for
[SPEAKER_01]: homeowners up to about 6% azadirachtin and
so like Ted said it's exponentially higher
[SPEAKER_01]: for an azadirachtin product with with
azadirachtin in it now with your cold
[SPEAKER_01]: pressed neem oils you're only going to
have a few hundred to maybe a few thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: parts per million azadirachtin so your
main mode of action really with a cold
[SPEAKER_01]: pressed is going to be the neem oil it is
basically more of a neem oil than it is an
[SPEAKER_01]: azadirachtin product but you do you will
have some of those still in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially get a little bit of additional
benefit than a pure neem oil product
[SPEAKER_01]: because those terpenes those tetra
terpenes haven't been removed and one
[SPEAKER_00]: other thing from Suzanne it was that
beneficial insects you may need to wait to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a release with some of these more
pungent oils because the beneficials may
[SPEAKER_00]: not want to colonize or infect on the leaf
surface as compared to like a
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural oil so I just want to throw
that in for folks because that's something
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne has shared research on in the past
yeah so your essential oils and your neem
[SPEAKER_01]: oil products or anything that has a lot of
fragrance to it or may have a mode of
[SPEAKER_01]: action associated with repellency not only
may it repel the insects that you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want but it may also repel the beneficial
insects now those benefit that those those
[SPEAKER_01]: effects are typically fairly short-lived
so maybe a little bit longer than what you
[SPEAKER_01]: can smell because insects are very
sensitive to the odors and so on this the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf surface level you may have additional
odor and repellency than what you can
[SPEAKER_01]: detect but I would say that if you're
planning a timing as everything with
[SPEAKER_01]: making spray applications of biopesticides
and using beneficial insects so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important that as you plan out your
program and if you are wanting to if you
[SPEAKER_01]: see an increase in the number of insects
that you want to maybe target with the
[SPEAKER_01]: spray and you want to use a neem oil or a
25b product and you're using beneficials
[SPEAKER_01]: as well and you don't want to kill those
beneficials typically the best timing
[SPEAKER_01]: would be before your next release so that
and I would for your neem oils for 25 bees
[SPEAKER_01]: I would leave a good I would say at least
three day buffer maybe longer three to
[SPEAKER_01]: five day buffer before you you make your
next release just to ensure that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not killing off those beneficials that you
are releasing which you don't want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is release and then do a spray because
even a water spray can kill a beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: so just being very cognizant of the timing
of your applications of both your
[SPEAKER_01]: biopesticides and your natural enemies is
going to be really important and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the best way to develop these programs to
ensure that you get the best bang for your
[SPEAKER_00]: buck both biopesticide and natural enemy
what are the risks associated with as a
[SPEAKER_00]: directing products I know they're harmful
to aquatic aquatic life marine life so you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to use them around water are
there any other are they the mode of
[SPEAKER_00]: action with them is a is are there a
neural disruptor they are main as a direct
[SPEAKER_01]: and huh anti-fedent what yeah there's
anti-fedent and repellency properties
[SPEAKER_01]: those are typically dose dependent and
short-lived so typically as we just
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned with the natural enemies the
higher the dose the longer the response
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe and that typically is only going to
last a couple of days at most so the other
[SPEAKER_01]: mode of action specifically with acid or
actin is that it's an insect growth
[SPEAKER_01]: regulator which means they were mainly
targeting juvenile insects and
[SPEAKER_01]: those those juvenile insects are your
target so you want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: juvenile insects are there at the time of
application and that you're not targeting
[SPEAKER_01]: your adults because adults will not be
impacted or much less so I went off on a
[SPEAKER_00]: tangent what was the original question any
risks associated with as a direct thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you so
[SPEAKER_01]: mode of action is insect growth regulator
so I'm sorry you can come back to it yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: ask another question because I or ask the
same question again just so I can just the
[SPEAKER_00]: as a directing products what are the other
risks associated with them as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: like using neem oil or stuff oil or some
of these other pesticides so name is a
[SPEAKER_01]: name and as direct and products are safe
that really low mammalian toxicity as Ted
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned if you apply any product that
has oil based to water it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: create an oil slick so it's going to be
toxic to fish also invertebrate insects in
[SPEAKER_01]: the water will be harmed by the as direct
and so that's a concern if you directly
[SPEAKER_01]: spray the beneficials there may be some
impact just because it's a spray if the if
[SPEAKER_01]: your beneficial insects sips from the
plant there could be some impact to the
[SPEAKER_01]: more impact to those insects than the
insects that purely just eat insects as a
[SPEAKER_01]: food source some beneficials will sit from
the plant so there could be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of more impact for those but for the most
part most beneficials are not harmed by as
[SPEAKER_01]: direct and if it is if it is a name oil
though of course there's that suffocation
[SPEAKER_01]: factor and or formulated in an oil there's
a suffocation factor so once again you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to try to minimize as much as
possible contact with your natural enemies
[SPEAKER_00]: to avoid that risk great well I think we
covered quite a bit so I really appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: it thank you for doing that today thank
you Ted I appreciate it
