[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest today is Ron Wallace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron is a two-time world record holder,
three-time world champion, and was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first grower in the world to grow a
pumpkin over 1,500 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2012, he was the first to eclipse
the 2,000 pound barrier at 2,009 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, he is regarded as one of the
world's premier giant pumpkin growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has appeared on many local and national
TV shows and been subject of numerous
[SPEAKER_01]: books, newspaper, and nationally
recognized magazine articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Ron, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to get to chat with you over
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's start off giving listeners a
little bit of your personal history and
[SPEAKER_01]: how you got into growing giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my dad was, I believe, the first
person in New England to grow giant
[SPEAKER_00]: pumpkins and start talking about it
competitively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was back in the early 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started doing it in his small backyard
in West Walker Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in those days, there wasn't much
information on giant pumpkins out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matter of fact, it was none.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to get on the phone, try to call
somebody or write somebody a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so he did it, you know,
close to 10 years and then never really
[SPEAKER_00]: achieved any success that he was looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he kind of got out of the get out of
the hobby at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember back in 1992 and 93,
I was at my parents' home for Christmas
[SPEAKER_00]: and somebody had bought him a book,
How to Grow World Class Giant Pumpkins by
[SPEAKER_00]: Don Langevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I read the whole book cover to cover on
Christmas Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know, we've got to give
this another shot because now we have some
[SPEAKER_00]: information that we can we can try to use
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since the early 90s, it's kind of been
obsessive, compulsive and education and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge trying to grow the world's
biggest pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a wild ride since the early
90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've actually had some success in
the giant pumpkin world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about where you
started in terms of what size your
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkins were and the genetics and how
that sort of evolved into eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: getting literally the world record?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the genetics is what separates,
you know, this hobby and the networking
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst the giant pumpkin community is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like no other community I've ever
witnessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reason why we can take on 900
anywhere from 800 to a thousand square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing pumpkins on the verge of
heading towards three thousand pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, world records at twenty six,
twenty four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been the genetics and the sharing
of knowledge and information and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic crosses that have taken place
since those early days that have put us to
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fortunate to get a couple of
really good, you know, what you call hot
[SPEAKER_00]: seed stocks that everybody everybody
wanted in their day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it enabled me to, you know,
set a couple of Guinness World Records and
[SPEAKER_00]: some North American championships.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's been the work of the whole
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the Internet evolved in the early
90s, and that's where I got all my
[SPEAKER_00]: information from back then after Don's
books was getting on the Internet and
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to soil scientists, if they would
talk to you, you know, many would kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just hang up or brush me off if they heard
Ron Wallace was on the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that kind of changed years later
because a lot of those people seek us out
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the community to see what we're doing
and how we're fertilizing and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty much been, you know,
the networking of the community,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sharing of information, the genetics
being a big one, you know, pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques, you know, being another one
and, you know, right soil biology and
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal inoculants, which have,
you know, put pumpkin growing on the verge
[SPEAKER_00]: where if you don't have two thousand pound
pumpkin, you're probably not going to win
[SPEAKER_00]: the way off you're going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking that when we started out,
to be a member of the five hundred pound
[SPEAKER_00]: club was something everybody strove,
you know, strive for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was, you know, the seven
hundred pound club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was, oh, my God, a thousand pound
club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the seminars that they had in
Canada at the time, I used to get up there
[SPEAKER_00]: and be one or two people or three people
who grew a thousand pound pumpkin to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, my God, I really want to be on
that stage someday growing a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: pound pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, with the right genetics
and the right system, going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 45, 50 days after you pollinate
your pumpkin, there's a lot of pumpkins on
[SPEAKER_00]: the verge of a thousand pounds or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been trying my hand at it for the
last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been fortunate enough to know Don and
Geneva Emmons.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're local to me and wonderful people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Ryan Ewing has been really
generous in sharing some of genetics from
[SPEAKER_01]: his squash and pumpkins and some of the
seeds that he has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a couple of years ago,
my record is seven hundred and twenty five
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not doing all of the bearing all
the vines and doing all the training and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that really needs to be done to
really grow a huge giant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But seven hundred twenty five pounds was a
huge hit with the preschool kids on the
[SPEAKER_01]: property and everyone that came to the
farm, which is so blown away by the
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's not that big compared to
what you guys do, but it still was pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty amazing for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not everybody gets involved in the
hobby is to try to set set records.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish I wasn't so competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want all my friends to do
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the network of the family and the
friends that we've made over the 25 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: years has been incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I swing for the fences and
a lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I wish I really wasn't that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a lot less pressure growing,
to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the majority of the people get
involved in the hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is to get something that they can be proud
of, put it out in front of their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get emails pretty much every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get somebody who called me the other
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moved me when he said that he was
making memories with his grandson that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to last a lifetime of growing his
giant pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's far more people who still seven
hundred pounds is a heck of an
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplishment to grow something that that
big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had people email me throughout my
first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had a thousand pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, that took us, you know,
almost 12 years and thousands of thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of dollars and hundreds and hundreds of
hours of backbreaking work to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve those results, to let the
information, the information is out there
[SPEAKER_00]: now on how to grow these giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of people who went before
the people nowadays to put the information
[SPEAKER_00]: out there on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's far more growing just to enjoy
it and have a pumpkin for their family
[SPEAKER_00]: than it is somebody who's trying to set a
record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice you'll never hear me
mention about winning money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's money to be won if you went
away often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been fortunate to win some,
but nobody grows giant pumpkins to have
[SPEAKER_00]: their eyes set on winning cash prizes
because those are few and far between.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give a little bit about sort of
the history of the giant pumpkin community
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of where you guys started and
where you are now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've thrown a few numbers out
there, but I don't know if listeners
[SPEAKER_01]: realize how much, how rapidly the industry
has evolved over the last, even just the
[SPEAKER_01]: last decade and sort of how your
techniques have changed over that time,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Howard Dill, a farmer in Nova
Scotia, is the one that we can credit for
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up with the Dills, the Dills
Atlantic giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, saying Howard was a four time,
four time world world champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in the late 70s and early
80s, he was doing the painstaking work and
[SPEAKER_00]: making the genetic crosses, you know,
that we still enjoy today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all, all of these genes, although
they're different, they all revert back to
[SPEAKER_00]: Howard Dill and his early and his early
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, once again, back at the time,
I think his world record was 400 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in the 1980s, early 80s
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I said, once the
Internet came upon, you know, people
[SPEAKER_00]: started to figure out that you have to
bury these vines in order to get a double
[SPEAKER_00]: root system, because where the vines run,
wherever there's a leaf stalk,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a root that will, that'll pop up
through the top and you have to stabilize
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we've made the biggest advances
is the technique of pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody who knows anything knows
pruning alters the state of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally for good, it forces growth
in different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we only let the side vines go so
long now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we kind of know it's between 12 and 15
feet on a side vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pretty much have figured out that to
try to be a contender, you need a plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: the square foot range of probably 700 to a
thousand, maybe even a maximum of 1200
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the vine burying, you know,
became one of the big keys and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with that is, you know,
how much kelp meal, you know, growers put
[SPEAKER_00]: about 15 pounds of kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp meal per a thousand square foot in
the spring to offer a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet was the first big push of the
hobby in the early nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then mycorrhizal fungi took giant
pumpkins to a different level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back in around 2006,
when I set my first world record,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started studying mycorrhizae around
2003, 2004, I started making phone calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I found Bob Lindemann at I
believe it was Oregon State University at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started educating me more on the
benefits of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started studying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used it and set a world record in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much everybody today who's
growing competitively uses, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi, the benefits,
the benefits of an endless and it really
[SPEAKER_00]: helps us do what we got to do as far as
bringing water back to the host and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people think mycorrhizae is just about
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's about water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a healthier root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those have been the big, the big
advancements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, another one that goes in
there is a sharing of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the education of it is free because
once again, back in the day, people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are winning weren't, you know,
letting people know what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, the people who were
winning, you know, they were adding a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of compost and cow manure and,
you know, there wasn't as many people
[SPEAKER_00]: growing as nowadays, not taking anything
away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they were innovators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had certain techniques that we still
use today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the internet took giant pumpkin
growing to a whole different level as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as the sharing and knowledge and education
and all for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a while there weren't giant pumpkin
growers primarily growing conventionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using, you know, chemical nutrients,
mineral salts, and then started
[SPEAKER_01]: reincorporating back some of these
biological additives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people use compost teas and
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that point in time and how did
that transition sort of increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability of the pumpkin of the yields of
these pumpkins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's a very good question
because, you know, compost teas certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: is used, you know, extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still find compost tea requires a little
bit more education on our part because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of snake oil, as you know,
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people need to be educated on
compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a very big percentage of
growers who are either using someone's or
[SPEAKER_00]: making their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps specifically but back in the
day all farming was was kind of synthetics
[SPEAKER_00]: and you laid it down and that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even major farming now has changed
where they find that those fertilizers we
[SPEAKER_00]: were using were killing the soil microbes
because it was so heavy in salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of it is,
you know, you're using potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the same as throwing rock salt on
your driveway in the winter to kill,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get rid of the ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what people were putting in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found over the years is that
there needs to be a mix between some
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic and mostly biological.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people's programs are probably 80%
biological, 20% kind of synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers because sometimes you need
that little extra push that a synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: will give you right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've learned, we've educated about,
like I tell people, we feed our soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil feeds our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let the microbes consume organic matter
and release it in what I like to call a
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in that area in and around the roots
where, you know, plants can use it and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it will only take what it needs
for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you use synthetics or something
else, it's, you know, it's just like
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing pigs at a buffet I like to say
because they just kind of eat,
[SPEAKER_00]: eat, eat and eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the best thing at times too
because we strive for balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the last 10 years specifically,
giant pumpkin growers have sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: switched their programs to more
biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of azospirilin, you know,
being used, bacillus subtilis and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I could go on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of growers, they're all using
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have, you know, their own little
system or maybe some biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like humic fulvic acid pretty much
used by me every time I water or fertilize
[SPEAKER_00]: to help make nutrients more available,
helps feed soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever I'm fertilizing my plant,
I like to say once again, I'm fertilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: my soil to make sure I got a good
population of microbes doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now feel free to correct me if I get this
wrong, but as it was explained to me that
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the issues that giant pumpkin
growers were having was because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: high amounts of chemical fertilizers that
were being used, the plants were more
[SPEAKER_01]: prone to cracking or splitting,
which is a disqualification in the giant
[SPEAKER_01]: pumpkin world for those of you that aren't
familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a crack or a split,
your pumpkin is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the season, but also you're more open
to diseases and things like that as you're
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing this pumpkin so hard to put on
weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an accurate statement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that's all, that's all correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't push them too hard,
especially with, you know, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: with synthetics and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you're more prone to disease
because pusarium, pythium, rhizoctonia,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those things that, you know,
cucurbits, which are pumpkins,
[SPEAKER_00]: they say, you know, plant like a year on
soil and then get off of it for five years
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's how prone they are to
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had my handful of disease
problems here and continue to monitor it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, all of those diseases I
just mentioned love nitrogen and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a giant pumpkin grower,
you're pushing both, but the nitrogen that
[SPEAKER_00]: you get from using synthetics far pushes,
you know, nutrient, you know, even
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies afterwards, because once they
get below did they tie up other nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that you'll be missing, but they also help
push disease too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've backed off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the splitting, you know, whether it's
a small crack that gets in a ring,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call a dill ring in a pumpkin
where a pumpkin grows so fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get cross-sections and they'll split.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stem splits used to be prevalent years and
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a big part of that was
genetics, number one, and number two was
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of been a eliminated a bit
from the hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see many stem splits anymore
because people won't grow them next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the great things about chat
rooms and the internet is you see what
[SPEAKER_00]: these pumpkin seeds are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't like the shape or if
you're a color person, you don't like the
[SPEAKER_00]: color or if it had a bad stem,
you just won't plant it next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it keeps sort of those bad traits out
of the hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, definitely we've noticed that
we've been able to get more pumpkins to
[SPEAKER_00]: the scales since we've imparted more of an
organic approach to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say that any of us are strictly
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people who grow that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible, but in our area where it's,
you know, like today's 92 degrees over 80%
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and tonight the low will be 70
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be humid all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to work in some chemicals on
occasion or you'll never make it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I grow all organically
because that's sort of our philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I get powdery mildew every year,
which I know is affecting my overall
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not going for a world record
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very different situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like it's a sort of a hybrid
approach that's really allowing you to
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually see this with the cannabis
industry, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the biggest yields I've seen have
been sort of that combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: biologicals and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's definitely what's happening
in our hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a combination, too, because,
you know, when you need to color up,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got something going on,
like right now we've got what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit load stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pumpkins are approaching,
if they're going to be an all-star,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got to be hitting between 30 and
50 plus pounds a day for the next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you notice, you start to get a
little lime green or you start to tie up
[SPEAKER_00]: some nutrients or, you know, if you've got
to go to the whip and color them up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can only feed the soil so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pop in some synthetics to get
it to green up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's such a small amount compared to
what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, the biggest yields we're finding
is people who are combining both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's plenty of studies out on the
Internet using biologicals in combination
[SPEAKER_00]: with synthetic fertilizers where now,
you know, a lot of the technology and the
[SPEAKER_00]: papers and field trials that they're doing
are coming out saying that the yields were
[SPEAKER_00]: increased using both in combination,
maybe 80-20 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people who grow strictly
organic, you know, don't want to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but the results are out there now
where you can see combining them both in
[SPEAKER_00]: the program works a bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all what you want to go after.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people who will grow in
medicine, there's a huge market for
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly organic, and they should stay
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people who just want size and
yield, and they go about it a different
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think you really hit on an
important point there when you said that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone was reducing the amount of
synthetic inputs that they were adding
[SPEAKER_01]: into their patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that is a goal for
myself as an organic grower is to help
[SPEAKER_01]: people in making that transition and get
people to use less chemical nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that these biologicals are not
only better for the plants, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: better for your plant and allows you to
reduce your inputs on the chemical side,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a fact, and it works,
especially now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that's snake oil, you know,
it may come out on the market with a great
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing pitch and fancy labels and stuff
like that, but growers are smart nowadays
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what you're growing,
whether you're growing flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, cannabis, or giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word gets out there pretty quick if
the stuff doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are really good at looking at
labels now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look on there and your main
ingredient is less than 1% or 0.001 of
[SPEAKER_00]: something, that's very, very reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people add, you know,
humic acid as a base to a lot of their
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff because it makes the water come out
nice and brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody thinks, wow, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how rich it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you get to educate yourself
and you read the label and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just paid this for a quart of humic
acid, that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people get sharp real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they should be nowadays that the
information's out there, what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: works and what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's an important point
because this really is for you guys a
[SPEAKER_01]: passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sport and sort of an act of love.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not making you any money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really doing it because you enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to make sure you follow a
budget so you're not spending all your
[SPEAKER_01]: money on your pumpkin patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read on bigpumpkins.com about all the
people and all the jokes that are made
[SPEAKER_01]: about how much people love to spend on
their patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much time they spend out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, right now at this time of
the year, I'm doing eight plants this
[SPEAKER_00]: year, which is too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go back to four to five because
it's just too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm 40 hours a week out here to
grow eight plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will put 40 hours in on four
plants or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people, you get very,
very obsessive, compulsive with doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you can spend an awful lot of
money doing this or you can get away with
[SPEAKER_00]: some, you know, rudimentary skills and go
see a friend down the street who has free
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and you can do well too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just one of those things,
probably like your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of get out of it what you put
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who's won these major weigh-offs
now or something, you know, they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it by spending one or $200 for the
season to grow their pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they made some sort of
investment other than time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can, like I said, you can put as
much into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or as little into it as you want and still
have, you know, some success, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are doing it consistently,
you know, they're investing a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more than time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned some of these things that
you're using in your patch and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these techniques that apply to giant
pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just wondering, how might we apply
some of that knowledge to growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you and I just talked a little bit off
air about watering and how important
[SPEAKER_01]: watering is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on that and how,
how it affects overall yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our giant pumpkins here right now,
my giant pumpkins, you know, around four,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 400, 500 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned, they're,
they're at that stage now, or if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a stud, they got to start
doing, you know, 38 to 50 plus pounds a
[SPEAKER_00]: day for a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having said that is you need water to
achieve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have an overhead watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of watering by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 275 gallon totes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where any biologicals or any fertilizers I
can put right in a toe and I can hand
[SPEAKER_00]: water and drench what I call a drench,
drench the plants myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these pumpkins right now are getting
close to a hundred gallons of water a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, we've had no rain in New England
here this season, other than really early
[SPEAKER_00]: in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be consistent with our
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how that is in your
community, but our watering has to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't skip, well, I'm not going to
worry about water today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm going to the beach with my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most of us have an automated
irrigation system that'll go on and off on
[SPEAKER_00]: its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, I'm home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have an automated system,
but I choose to run it myself where I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have water twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get 50 gallons by around 11,
1130 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wait till the plants are dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the worst things you can do is
water any plant, whether it be vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, cannabis or anything, especially
in the morning, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: outside with this dew on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start watering, especially
overhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any mold spores, you're just
going to blow them all over to all your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's best to let your plants dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I opt for kind of late morning to water
my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So around 11, 1130, that water will kick
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll come back at the hottest time of
the day, right around two 30, two 30 to
[SPEAKER_00]: three o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, you know, I run six overhead
sprinklers at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in 25, 30 minutes,
I can pump out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 50 gallons per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can do about 300 gallons in that,
in that timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we find watering has to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be there every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you get, you know, one,
two, three inches of rain, you can back
[SPEAKER_00]: off for a few days and hopefully you don't
get too much rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's another thing we find.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let the soil go dry and you take a
big, big rainstorm, you could explode your
[SPEAKER_00]: pumpkins because now they were deprived of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's so many roots in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just sucking up water and you
could have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really need to be consistent with
our watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because one of the things you're
finding too is without this consistency,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're losing yield, which I think is the
big takeaway for cannabis growers is water
[SPEAKER_01]: stress, whether overwatering or
underwatering is going to affect your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's susceptibility to disease and also
its ability to maximize yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a fine line on the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe me, I've pushed it too much
many a times because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's really hot and really humid,
especially if you're growing outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the root system does is it kind of
shuts down because what it's doing is it's
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting that leaf stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's protecting what you call going up the
chimney where your vapor loss and your
[SPEAKER_00]: water loss goes right out through the
stomata of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're hot and humid, the plant
protects itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots kind of close it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do, you know, watering a lot at that
time because now your roots are just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to sit there in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer they sit there in water without
working actively, then you open yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: up for pythium, water molds, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I follow with consistency of having
your pumpkin, what we call weighing over
[SPEAKER_00]: the charts or weighing on chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a chart that we go by as to what
your pumpkin should weigh by inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very good chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very close in weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fortunately have had many that have gone
over the charts, which is a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all comes from genetics do play
some role in that, but it's watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I started watering a little more a
few years ago, my pumpkins consistently
[SPEAKER_00]: started to weigh more than what they
should because they're all their water
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, this is a fine line as to
am I adding too much water or am I adding
[SPEAKER_00]: enough water?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very, very narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watering is something that all
gardeners no matter what you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: need to get dialed in on what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have sandy wound soil here in New
England, and people tell me all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, how many gallons of water you're
adding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if I'm adding 100 gallons,
if you're in Pennsylvania somewhere and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a heavy clay soil, that might be
twice the amount of water you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always very leery to give watering
amounts or fertilizing amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I push with boron a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boron rhymes with moron, and you can
go toxic with boron really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my sandy wound soil, boron is tough
to keep the levels up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need boron for cell division,
cell elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to use borax sometimes twice a
week at a pretty high amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't let that amount out to
anybody, not to be secretive, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want anybody doing damage to their plants
and getting toxicity because I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue testing for 25 years and I kind of
know what my plants need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find every garden is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe in your community, that's the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers are always asking
somebody, hey, what are you doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes yours look this good?
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody says, well, I use this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody says, OK, that's going to be
the magic bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's really no one magic bullet,
but that person set up their lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: their watering, their drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that people who are successful
doing anything, there's more than one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear that a lot where people will be
like, you've got to try product X.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one thing that saved my garden or
made me put on yield or it's a magic
[SPEAKER_01]: bullet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that you alluded to there
was that you're doing tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I want to talk a
little more about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, it comes down to any
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that magic bullet product is the
limiting growth factor in the soil or in
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant, then, yeah, you're going to
get amazing results.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's not like if your soil is
already high in potassium and this product
[SPEAKER_01]: is high in potassium, you're going to
actually potentially do something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: detrimental for your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a really important point
that you brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody will say to me, hey,
what do you think of this product?
[SPEAKER_00]: So-and-so uses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, OK, well, I have respect for
that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so-and-so has low potassium in their
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to teach people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be surprised how many people don't
know how to read a fertilizer label,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the three numbers mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're high in potassium,
like you said, you're putting potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: down to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium is like the dominant dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the number one thing that gets in the
exome and the root system and the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: system of plant quicker and faster than
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your potassium is high, you know
you're blocking out magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once your plant's got the yellow a
bit, you know magnesium sulfur is a
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency that's been caused by excess
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't stress that more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how the tissue testing goes
in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure now with the explosion of it
that there's going to be labs specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you test your garden so many
times, I can tell a lot of times by
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at it what a deficiency is because
I've been in the same gardens for 25
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find the soil and the tissue tests
don't vary too much year-to-year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tissue test every two weeks at this time
of the year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My last tissue test will probably be
around the 1st of September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much enough for me to
take it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until you really get dialed in as to
what's going on in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it really doesn't make sense to know
what's going on in a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm in the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know what your conditions are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's tough for me to educate somebody
until they get dialed in in their own
[SPEAKER_00]: patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good way of doing that is with the,
you know, tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People tell me, well, I soil tested the
other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, soil is only going to tell you
what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's there?
[SPEAKER_00]: The tissue test is going to tell you
what's going up the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the most important thing at the
stage we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a little challenging with
cannabis for a couple reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, the big challenge is not a lot of
labs will do tissue testing on cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: because it is still federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't mail samples in, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other challenge is that a lot of
growers don't know how to interpret soil
[SPEAKER_01]: tests or tissue tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the tests that we now sell is an
artificial resin test from this company
[SPEAKER_01]: called Soil Savvy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it is, is it shows what the plant
potentially could take up over a period of
[SPEAKER_01]: five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the advantage of that being it gives
you a little better idea of what the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is able to take out of the soil versus,
say, like a Malik 3 test that will just
[SPEAKER_01]: tell us everything that's in the soil,
but not what's available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good point there that you
brought up regarding testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're doing is a combination of
soil testing, chemical fertilizers in
[SPEAKER_01]: small amounts, and then biologicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that pretty accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, the biologicals have been
huge for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically in the last, maybe about
10 years ago, it started to get a big
[SPEAKER_00]: push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you remember, for years,
even scientists didn't give much credit to
[SPEAKER_00]: biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everybody knows the important role
that they play in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, biologicals are huge for us and
the combination of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one's ever burnt their plants or
put on biologicals and then walked away
[SPEAKER_00]: the next day and came out and had
fertilizer burn so bad that it affected
[SPEAKER_00]: your yield from biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, biologicals, a little bit goes a
long way, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about multiplying colonies in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell people all the time now,
you got to start biologicals early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you do have a problem,
it's like taking a knife to a gun point at
[SPEAKER_00]: some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't come in with biologicals when
you have a problem, or you can't start
[SPEAKER_00]: midway in the cycle of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's better than nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had no choice, you can start at
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start them right from the
beginning, right out of the box,
[SPEAKER_00]: right into the soil, that's how you start
with mycorrhizae and any biologicals when
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant's small.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you using exactly in your
garden right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned humic and fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned potentially compost teas and
mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sorts of things are you using in your
patch?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a lot of seaweed, a lot of seaweed
powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a tremendous one on my site
that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much every watering has humic,
fulvic, and seaweed in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, seaweed's one of the best overall
things you can feed your plants because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the trace minerals and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps remineralize your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the best things that you can
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use that pretty much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opt to feed daily and spoon feed,
rather than put on a heavy dose once or
[SPEAKER_00]: twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every day I'm feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a lot of alamino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great product out there from
Growth Products called Essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essential and Companion, Companion's
bacillus subtilis, which is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: biological to help shield roots for
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two are like my peanut butter and
jelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two weeks, every 14, maybe 17 days
max, I'm going on with a drench of those
[SPEAKER_00]: two biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in that drench, I'll use Azos from
Extreme Gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Azos sprillin, I mean, it's a tremendous
fixer of atmospheric nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another benefit of it is it helps
plants create that natural growth hormone,
[SPEAKER_00]: indole-3-acetic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It promotes that naturally in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the biggest benefit to me
because the more roots that you have that
[SPEAKER_00]: it creates, the more roots, the more areas
you have for inoculation by your
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a total whole program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I also use like Epsom salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of many home gardeners know by now
it's not just for soaking your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salts applies a quick shot of
magnesium and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my potassium gets a little high in my
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the mistake of adding too much
compost last fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've paid the price so far this season
by tying up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I need to add a quick shot of sulfur
and some magnesium, there's nothing better
[SPEAKER_00]: or more realistic in price than Epsom
salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use a lot of fish, seaweed,
powdered seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it fish, fish and seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mixture of the two, humic fulvic
acid and those biologicals I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much they're in my program once a
week I'm doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the other ones I'm doing like
the companion and essential every two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's by labeled rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need of putting it on more than
label rate because some of that stuff can
[SPEAKER_00]: get costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to waste money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without ever expanding root system on
our plant, we need to apply it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in like it seems to be
like out in New England, the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growers grow 12 plants and pretty
much everybody grows in between a five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon, 15 gallon pot seems to be the home
gardener here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably do it a little less
because your roots are contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our root system is so vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll find roots, you know,
10 foot out past where the vines are.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our garden, and there'll be no leaf or
vine around within 10 foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those, those roots are just racing past
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they're looking for,
they're looking for water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to, you know, we probably have
to cut the rate down a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: drench a little bit more with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's pretty much the basis of my,
you know, biological, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, like I mentioned the borax too,
and I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it in with my Epsom salts and I have
to do that here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for reasons I mentioned because
of my sandy moon soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, there's some good studies
out, especially with seaweed that show
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, micro doses at greater
frequency perform much better than high
[SPEAKER_01]: doses a fewer times a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it definitely makes a difference to
apply these things like you are in smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts at greater frequency, especially
with the humic acid and the seaweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I cut the label rate down on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm drenching out of 275 gallon
tanks right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the label rates, you know,
let's call it a teaspoon per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, just think of how much
product you would need each drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cut that down, you know, by less than
half, you know, sometimes a quarter of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do like a quarter of the amount,
but I'm doing it three, four days in a
[SPEAKER_00]: row, unless I get some rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I, like I said, I'd rather be there
just a little bit at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could tell you another connection
that we have now too, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with, with cannabis growers is pretty much
a lot of the heavy hitters in the hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all pHing our water now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we never did up until a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be surprised what some of these
nutrients can do with the pH of your
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start adding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was shocked when I first started pHing
my water back in 2015, just how something
[SPEAKER_00]: skyrocketed it and some stuff dropped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find kind of pH around 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pH two or something like that seems to,
seems to work best for the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's another common connection of
what we're doing, you know, and what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your community's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's a lot of parallels there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the things I like to bring
up because you guys are just as passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: about your plants as cannabis growers are,
and you're both pushing the envelope in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of trying out the latest and the
greatest techniques or the latest and
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest products as a way of maximizing
growth and yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of parallels there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I think you guys are actually a
little more fanatic because you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting, you're not getting a final
product that's either edible or smokeable
[SPEAKER_01]: or sellable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really just doing it for the
satisfaction of this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: having the largest vegetable in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a very good point because
we're not, you know, Oz has not grown for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has no medical value to it or anything,
but Oz has grown just, yeah, just for
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some people grow for color,
you know, some people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they like their genetics and they'll only
plant stuff that's going to throw a really
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty orange, you know, pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, most of us are just
strictly for size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we do push the envelope a bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very good point where,
you know, someone in your community might
[SPEAKER_00]: not because of, you know, the medical,
you know, value of it, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we do, we do push the envelope,
you know, real hard and real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, once again, to think that,
you know, we're probably only four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: years away, maybe from a 3000 pound
pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably be done by somebody growing
in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got some really good
greenhouse growers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I, I started a,
I used a bigger greenhouse this year in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring for the first time ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was only in it for six weeks and it
blew, you know, it blew the plants right
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growing so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was not in there for the heated
season because being in New England,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you had thousands of dollars,
you could never cool it or get the airflow
[SPEAKER_00]: in there to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my first six weeks I grew in a
greenhouse was like one team playing with
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum bats and one team playing with
wooden bats is no comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the first 3000 pound pumpkin
will be grown in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to think that we're on the verge of
that is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing should get that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, I'll say it a hundred
times that comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: People willingly working with each other,
uh, and sharing information and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, pumpkin growers,
like you said, you said it best.
[SPEAKER_00]: We push the envelope because we just call
it the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I find with the cannabis community
that reaches out to me, there's a small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Niche of growers who really, that I found
that really want to educate themselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: they really want to do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want better, healthier plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a bigger yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that are on the
internet and they're studying,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're studying labels, they're studying
biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the ones that kind of reach
out to me and ask a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find around here in New England,
most who got involved in the cannabis wave
[SPEAKER_00]: that came in huge for us a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody thought because maybe they
liked the effects of cannabis that they'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be good at running a business doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they kind of all went out of
business already, but I found a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If their friend got them into the hobby
and said, Hey, this is all you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cycle, this cycle, that cycle,
and you're all done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find a good percentage of those growers
never do anything else or use anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else because they're perfectly happy with
enough for their own consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe sell some to a dispensary
or to a friend and make a couple extra
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, those, uh, that's a, that's a big
percentage of people in our area here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a, there's a, a quarter of
that, that'll really want to educate
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and, and push their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not afraid to make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who's growing anything better than
anybody else, they've made mistakes where
[SPEAKER_00]: they've lost a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've lost yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've made mistakes, but then they come
back and they perfected it and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: done better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's those people that aren't afraid to
push the envelope that eventually are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get honed in on a system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really the big takeaway in my book is
it's all about figuring out what the
[SPEAKER_01]: limiting factor of growth is, whether it's
your genetics, whether it's your watering,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's some sort of nutrient
imbalance or some sort of lacking microbe
[SPEAKER_01]: or biological activity in your soil,
whatever it is that's limiting your
[SPEAKER_01]: overall growth or, you know, in some
cases, like you mentioned, it may be root
[SPEAKER_01]: space and maybe you're in a container too
small, but whatever it is that's limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: is what's going to determine your overall
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can reduce the number of things
that are limiting factors in your soil or
[SPEAKER_01]: remove them, you're going to maximize the
plant's ability to grow healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: To to grow a giant pumpkin or grow really
good, high quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't have said it better myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much effort are you putting in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it come down to for time?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a reason why that people
consistently grow the best, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best quality, the best yields,
whether it's pumpkins, cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you'll find that they're working
really hard and they're putting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell people time you can't expect to
get those results.
[SPEAKER_00]: By putting in that effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, a lot of that comes down
to effort to at times and how much how
[SPEAKER_00]: much you're putting into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a real fascination,
the connection between cannabis growers
[SPEAKER_00]: and giant pumpkin growers, because that,
you know, what I found is they're all very
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a mutual admiration society.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get everybody in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what you do for a
living, what you did, what your race is,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing that all fades away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The common love for growing what you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the information starts to come
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about your community,
but in our community, there's really no
[SPEAKER_00]: secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody just sits there and tells
everybody, yeah, I think this will help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because that's how we've pushed
along and and succeeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, push him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people growing eight pound
tomatoes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pushing the envelope towards the
world's first ten pound tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that really is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: As someone who loves and grows tomatoes,
I can't even imagine I've never gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown five pound tomatoes and I don't
put a ton of effort into my tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the giant tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: My vegetable garden looks looks really
good, but it just it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, genetics of what some of these
plants are capable of now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, once again, that all goes
back to everybody sharing information,
[SPEAKER_00]: making these genetic crosses and making
the seeds available, the plants available.
[SPEAKER_00]: To people, you know, that big pumpkins dot
com, the website you mentioned is that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: go to for giant pumpkin growers always has
been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's still as popular,
if not more, even with the onset of
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and Facebook and all of that
stuff, where a lot of people get their
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big pumpkins is still a community that we
go to to post our information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I heard Jerry Seinfeld got on there
for a little bit, apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did hear that somebody played that for
me a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the giant pumpkins have brought
success and it brought notoriety to
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You name all those national shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the pumpkin growers have been on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really brought a lot of attention to
the hobby, because what might be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit different, you know, where cannabis
sometimes is still looked upon as not
[SPEAKER_00]: being as overall accepted as what a giant
pumpkin would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves a giant pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody smiles every October.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we've got to see a giant
pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of growers have been
on a national news, every magazine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, TV, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it brings a lot of attention to the
hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, which is which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about what
you're doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked you mentioned mycorrhizal
fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you now sell some of these
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a you have a website,
which I'll mention at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you can mention it right now,
as well as some products that you really
[SPEAKER_01]: believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little about what you're
doing now for a business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, WallaceWow.com is my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I mentioned earlier,
I got fascinated in the study of
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungi, you know, back in 2002,
2003, I started educating myself more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And became really fascinated by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I, you know, set my first world
record in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big part of that was using
mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I, you know, I found over the years
that there was there was a market for
[SPEAKER_00]: people who were very much interested in
obtaining high quality mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: and fresh mycorrhizal fungi, not something
that's been sitting on a shelf or in a
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse for a few years, because all of
these biologicals, they don't get any
[SPEAKER_00]: better the longer they sit in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, food service had been my,
you know, my trade, I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: executive chef been in the business my
whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And four years ago, you know, I started
working with a manufacturer, and he said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Ronnie, you would be really good at
running your own business, you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: brand recognition, your respected guy,
you know, so let's work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been it's been four years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I retired from my job at the
country club in February, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for a few reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I worked in food service all my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked every night weekend and holiday
for 35 years since high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, the business became so demanding
and so popular, you know, knock on wood
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had to dedicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could not be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what time I was anymore had to
be full time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I do have a lot of, you know,
happy customers and they, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: both the cannabis and, you know,
the giant pumpkin community, home
[SPEAKER_00]: gardeners, people growing flowers,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they found me on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what I found is I'm,
you know, I have kind of a grassroots
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if people didn't like the
product and it didn't work, then it
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, what I found in,
you know, a giant pumpkin community and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis community is they're very
free to mention, Hey, this product really
[SPEAKER_00]: did work well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of how I, I got my
grassroots approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and built the business, uh,
you know, because, you know, didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the budget going in to be spending,
you know, a thousand dollars a month on
[SPEAKER_00]: Google ad words or anything else like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of started slow and it really,
uh, it really took off these people are
[SPEAKER_00]: very happy with the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The labels are easy to read the
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I stand behind, you know,
my products and, you know, I, I sell a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things that, you know, people use in
our everyday gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a, you know, I have a starter pack,
you know, a lot of cannabis growers use
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, starting in the year,
you know, they transplants in,
[SPEAKER_00]: they seem to really like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the home gardeners,
you know, I find that women drives the
[SPEAKER_00]: market for the home gardeners because I
get tons of email from women and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and they have legitimate concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I don't want my hands in a bag of
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, my starter pack is enclosed
in a tea bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all you have to do is take the tea
bag out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even have to open it up,
put it underneath the plant and walk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things have been, things have been
going real well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I brought on a social
media person recently and I have some help
[SPEAKER_00]: now in my warehouse with shipping and
receiving because it, it started getting
[SPEAKER_00]: out in front of me where, you know,
like any small business, um, how much
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory do I need?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I, I'm sure you can
attest to these mistakes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get, you get short handed a couple of
times in inventory because you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: just what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have too much because,
you know, my whole thing is freshness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not fresh, um, I'm not going to
sell it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but things are, things have been
working out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very, very happy doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the emails I get from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the educating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it's been very passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and the, and the members of the
Walla family is what I call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very passionate about growing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I hadn't, you and I started
talking when you originally started the
[SPEAKER_01]: business, we were talking about
mycorrhizal fungus, just conversations,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, over the phone and, and you,
you and I talked about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this, some of the packaging sizes and I've
been using and selling the, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: five pound package that you have,
the wow, mycorrhiza, uh, for a few years
[SPEAKER_01]: now, you've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's great to hear you're expanding
and things are going well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's really, really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you've been instrumental in helping
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you were my first, uh, you know,
wholesale, uh, account, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of got me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked together on figuring things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been instrumental in helping with
the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, I, I've found that with
many, many people that I've dealt with
[SPEAKER_00]: who, who have a business, they've been
more than open to saying, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how we should be looking at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would come in from the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from food service.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't call up somebody who was a
competitor or sold similar products and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, Hey, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that a lot of people in this end
of it have been, you know, like karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel if they're good to you,
you'll be good to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody succeeds and there's plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of room for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, it's, yeah, it's been,
uh, it's been amazing every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thankful when I wake up and,
and I have orders to fulfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very, very blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we do sell similar products,
but at the same time, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all, we're all doing something
better for the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if we're getting people to use
organics and promoting biological self,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that I really love about
your product is it is the right species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the, uh, Glomus interatices or,
uh, rhizophagus, uh, irregularis is the
[SPEAKER_01]: new name, but, uh, it's the right species
of mycorrhizae for most vegetables,
[SPEAKER_01]: including pumpkins and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know if I'm buying it for you,
I'm getting something that's fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really important to me because
I'm not going through a giant distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: system where it may have been,
you know, in a warehouse for a year before
[SPEAKER_01]: getting to that hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm buying it there or online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't know what you get either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, I really enjoy working with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish you the best with your,
your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue to work hard,
uh, every day and sell the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, freshest, you know, mycorrhizal
product out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, just blessed to be in such,
you know, the two big communities is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the giant pumpkins one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'll always be, you know,
I am the, you know, giant pumpkin man is
[SPEAKER_00]: what everybody calls me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, uh, and, and a cannabis community
is, is accepted me very, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're like working with small
business, you know, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get a lot of comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are that I actually return a phone
call and an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, now I do that every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but that's wonderful communities to
work in some really nice people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: working hard to make the world a better
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I thoroughly enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hopefully you can see another world
record this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it would be, that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I, I really have a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to win another world
championship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that would be my fourth and that
would tie Howard Dill, the creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, at four world championships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if I could do that one day,
I would probably take a year or two off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is my goal is to tie,
uh, to tie Howard, uh, the world record.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think me personally, I'm probably a
few years away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 2,624 pounds was and is an
incredible, incredible pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I have to perfect my system a
little bit more now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I have to get a better start with my
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need some pretty good weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it probably won't happen for me
this year, but we're going to have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever I get, uh, it won't be from a
lack of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, one day I'll hoist that
record again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I, that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, if you don't have a goal,
if you can't think it, you'll never do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Ron Wallace, two time world
record holder and three time world
[SPEAKER_01]: champion for giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: His website is wallacewow.com where you
can see photos of the amazing pumpkins
[SPEAKER_01]: he's grown along with other vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope today's podcast was helpful for
growers when considering yield and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: can incorporate some of these principles
with growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested in growing your own
giant pumpkin, I suggest checking out
[SPEAKER_01]: bigpumpkins.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to the Cannabis Cult of
Aviation and Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget, there's more information
articles available on our website and blog
[SPEAKER_01]: at www.kisorganics.com as well as links to
the data and information we discussed in
[SPEAKER_01]: this episode on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
