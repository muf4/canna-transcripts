[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget, if you want to stay up to
date with everything we're up to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can subscribe to our newsletter on our
homepage at www.kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this week is Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris is a master natural farmer certified
by Master Cho of Korea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has also studied microbiological
analysis under Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: His family's farm is currently the largest
natural farm in America, growing over 800
[SPEAKER_00]: acres of macadamia nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have returned sick trees to vital
health, completely eliminating three
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal diseases that academics said was
impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Chris and I talk about the successes
he's had with Korean natural farming and
[SPEAKER_00]: the philosophy behind it, which you'll
hear both of us refer to periodically as
[SPEAKER_00]: KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't go too deeply into how many of
the nutrients are made, as I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: audio is the best format for explaining in
detail how to make the IMO preps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to the podcast page on the
Kiss Organics website, you can find links
[SPEAKER_00]: to more information and videos from Chris
detailing exactly how this is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed our conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to hear about the amazing
projects Chris is working on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoy it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you coming on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to hear and learn all about
Korean natural farming and sort of your
[SPEAKER_00]: role in that realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you could start off telling me a
little bit about your personal history and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you got into KNF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew up farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: The place I was born in Hualoa on the Big
Island of Hawaii was a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had goats and cattle and milking cows
and yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And growing up, we tried to, my dad farmed
a bunch of different things and some super
[SPEAKER_01]: successfully and some not so successfully,
which is the life of a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciated that perspective and kind of
life growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to grow up a little bit in
California, Monterey, California,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I grew up roving cattle and
cattle and castrating with the Paniolo in
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd go to kind of city life in
California, you know, having eaten cow
[SPEAKER_01]: testicles over the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like, just no perspective
of anything rural and country living.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it was a fun back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They learned quickly that not to talk
about castrating cattle in a city school
[SPEAKER_01]: because people don't really get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my dad brought over some of the
first hair sheep to the Big Island,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a type of sheep about a ton of
wool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's real short hair, great for
tropical environments because the wool
[SPEAKER_01]: sheep get all kinds of skin diseases in
the warm kind of humid conditions of
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they brought them over with the idea
that they'd be a little bit closer to
[SPEAKER_01]: Micronesia and some of the other Pacific
Islands because there's pretty poor
[SPEAKER_01]: protein sources there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have cattle, but often not
refrigeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a family to butcher a cow,
you know, they don't, they can't really
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with it in enough time for it not all
to spoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sheep was going to be a better option.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This December, I think we'll ship some
sheep for breeding to Cambodia.
[SPEAKER_01]: As part of that kind of long-term vision
and help with a small farm there that's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to create a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we still have about a hundred
sheep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 30 years ago, my dad started farming
macadamia nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The situation happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a existing orchard and we got to
move in and start farming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't own the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lease the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used to run about a thousand sheep.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand sheep in the orchard and then
some of the laws changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so we run about 200 sheep now,
but I still have the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently my family farms 800 acres of
organic macadamia nuts, all using Korean
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming and just composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the exclusive kind of nutrition
program for the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's working really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a better position as a farm than
we've ever been.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can relate a little bit because my
father had a nursery and landscaping
[SPEAKER_00]: business growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew up around plants myself and
having parents that were really into
[SPEAKER_00]: farming and organics and growing plants in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand that connection between
family business and farms and that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel very fortunate to have had that
growing up myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to see a little bit of what you
were talking about when I visited the Big
[SPEAKER_00]: Island in terms of the horses and the
cowboys, the Paniolo, I think it is what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really interesting history there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, everyone says that you're the guy to
talk to when it comes to Korean natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming here in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's other people too,
but they are unwilling to necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: bridge the gap between cannabis and
agriculture, which I can totally
[SPEAKER_00]: understand and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people do talk about how much success
you've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you yourself are not a cannabis
farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've been growing the macadamia nut
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did you find out about Korean
natural farming to even bring it onto your
[SPEAKER_00]: property?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a bit of a journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm definitely not a cannabis farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there has been times in my life where
I have been a cannabis farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't quite call that a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anything a high schooler
does is considered farming for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, for us in the trees,
that was a journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up with a lot of really smart
people in my industry in the orchard
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Hawaii, where kind of the cultivation
of macadamia nut as a commercial operation
[SPEAKER_01]: was begun.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of really informed and
knowledgeable people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get to be around them growing up,
which was a real gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hear recommendations for trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, macadamia nut came from Australia
originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were just kind of a wild,
never really cultivated tree there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Hawaii began kind of variety trials
and started that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Australians took it back from
Hawaii and began on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it was a bit of a journey to
record and recognize about 12 years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 13, that the people that were
experts in our industry in macadamia nuts
[SPEAKER_01]: might not be able to explain everything
that's going on in nature and how best to
[SPEAKER_01]: attend to the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an event where we had a major crop
failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long story, but the short of it is we
had to let our organic, we were a split
[SPEAKER_01]: operation at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to let about 360 acres go fallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that time, they became far
healthier than they'd been with extensive
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing kind of traditional organic
practices with some purchased amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: and composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in three years of being left alone,
they were healthier than they had been in
[SPEAKER_01]: a really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we made kind of a commitment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it was my job, but made a
commitment to kind of not know anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we began to just kind of what did
nature do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is nature doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how can we kind of do that in the
future?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we partner with what just
happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: We watched trees go from yellow to green
and from low in production to higher in
[SPEAKER_01]: production while being completely ignored
for three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led us to explore different
things that were going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics explosion and then into Korean
natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were people bringing, so kind of the
initiator of this was this guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Park, Dr. Hoon Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a pediatrician turned like after 50
years of watching kind of disease increase
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time as medicine got better.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: There must be our food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went to Korea, sat in a 10-hour,
two-day class, two days or 10 hours a day
[SPEAKER_01]: standing room only in a little shed to
listen to this guy, Cho Han-yoo,
[SPEAKER_01]: and who people call Master Cho,
which is just a term for teaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a teacher in Korea.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came back and he started just being a
sharer of that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to one of the first classes he was
teaching about and people were heckling
[SPEAKER_01]: them because it's a bit of a mind shift on
how we traditionally do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that really got some
hackles or whatever laughter from the
[SPEAKER_01]: crowd was he talked about transplanting a
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've heard your
listeners transplanting a tree
[SPEAKER_01]: traditionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really gentle and you really try
and alleviate any shock by not disturbing
[SPEAKER_01]: it too much and prepping your hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of good ways to do it,
but Korean natural farming, you take it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you wash off all the potting soil or all
the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You trim the taproot and you let it trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: You let it dry for a day or two,
depending on the size of the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody just slipped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm scratching my head because that is not
how you transplant a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he's like, and then you take this
nutrient, you soak it, and then you plant
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole idea of helping it to move out
in its cedar roots, seeking water.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's giving it this idea that it needs to
work on roots because there could be
[SPEAKER_01]: drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, I committed not to
knowing anything and just was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: That really works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was 10 years ago, a little more than
10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an incredible way to transplant trees
and the trees do work on reproduction
[SPEAKER_01]: before leaf production.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that scenario, they get stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they survive, they're going to continue
to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Massachoe and his daughter came to my
tiny small town in Kohala.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a right place at a time when
we were already seeking these answers
[SPEAKER_01]: because of what nature had done on our
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I began a journey of going to get a
bunch of times to study.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started, we were just skeptical as
farmers tend to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just decided to do it really well,
but had no real preconceived expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to watch what it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had results.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had really great results.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a disease in macadamia that
industry called macadamia quick decline,
[SPEAKER_01]: macadamia slow decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a root-borne fungal disease called
Cytospora.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some affected trees in the 14-tree
trial we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had made some biochar and some spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd done it right according to ... We'd
really been diligent with the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know if it was going to fail or
not, but we didn't want it to fail because
[SPEAKER_01]: we screwed it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to give it a good try.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had these trees recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: These disease trees that in our industry,
you push them after a year or two and they
[SPEAKER_01]: bounce back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within a year, they were refoliated.
[SPEAKER_01]: These trees get fully defoliated and then
just keel over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They refoliated within a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: By year two, they were back in production.
[SPEAKER_01]: By year three, they were healthy,
vibrant trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole lot more to that journey
of scaling up, going from these concepts
[SPEAKER_01]: that were being taught to us and
wheelbarrow scale to 800-acre scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a serious journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it was pretty much by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have a buddy that'd come out and
just be a real encouragement and help me
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Guy Poncho, San Pedro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a crazy horse guitarist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just made it fun to have somebody to
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people on our farm were just
like, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of mad scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we're full tilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a big old operating lab or
warehouse facility all geared around just
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiencies in the natural farming
process for our large farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you were on this journey of
trying to find the right method for your
[SPEAKER_00]: farm and try something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just started from scratch and decided
you were going to give this a shot and you
[SPEAKER_00]: kept having more and more success
following these natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that about the gist of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't start natural farming because
we're like, oh, this philosophy is what we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had 30 employees and their priority on
our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the main reason in a economically
suppressed town.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't going to do something that
jeopardized taking care of what we had to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to be farmers first.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't going to go out of business for
some Korean natural farming philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do Korean natural farming and we
continued from the step-by-step trials and
[SPEAKER_01]: scaling up because it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just saw success at each scale step.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings up a question for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel Korean natural farming
compares to other organic or natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming techniques that you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your soil food web people,
regenerative agriculture, probiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these different groups that
are all slightly different but on a
[SPEAKER_00]: similar path.
[SPEAKER_00]: What separates in your eyes KNF from some
of these other methods?
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of ways, it's all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These work or don't work because they work
or don't work without nature's designs or
[SPEAKER_01]: function.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like gravity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most sports that you have all have these
similar features go anywhere in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: because they all play on gravity affecting
the ball falling back down.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these things play into,
they use the principles of nature and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not one method to tend to the life
of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been methods all over the world
throughout the centuries that were
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science is the observation of the study of
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were scientific in that they stopped
doing what didn't work and kept doing what
[SPEAKER_01]: worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers aren't stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: After several generations, the things that
worked were the ones that were passed
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were the successful things for the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have Iceland.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take manure from the end of the
season, stuff it in a hollowed out form
[SPEAKER_01]: and bury it below where the freeze goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next year, they dig it up and spread it on
their field right after the thaw and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a jump start to the microbial life in
their soil and the production of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't know what microbes were but
they knew that worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow, somebody figured out that worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a way to basically protect the
vibrant soil life from a freeze and get
[SPEAKER_01]: back up to speed a little faster so that
they could get a little longer season for
[SPEAKER_01]: their crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Short answer, the difference is
methodologies, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like about green natural farming is
that for me, it's an elegant method.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I encountered all these inputs and ways
to do this, I dug in and asked why.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how my mind works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to understand because I need to
know, especially as I scaled, what things
[SPEAKER_01]: can I mess with or what things are
shiftable and what aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I can't just change things
because I don't want to do it because if I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't understand it, I don't know what I'm
changing and what I'm losing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I dug into the why, I found a lot of
solid science.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the things that we were teasing
that understanding in the microbiological
[SPEAKER_01]: world were principles that this was based
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone new studied in Japan with enzyme
doctors and some of these natural farming
[SPEAKER_01]: leaders there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on good science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way that is scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is extremely effective and works for
commercial ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not true in all natural farming
principles and practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though they are all paired with how nature
works, some of them are extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to scale or just the
efficiencies of farming make them
[SPEAKER_01]: untenable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like permaculture, for example,
permaculture is rad and based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: principles of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you give me an 800-acre farm and my
spinach is sparse here and there over 800
[SPEAKER_01]: acres, when I have a spinach harvest,
my cost to harvest spinach is pretty high
[SPEAKER_01]: just because of efficiency, the inability
to get it all in a basket and get it to
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I have a small family or a few
families and I have a giant permaculture
[SPEAKER_01]: food forest in my backyard, then it's
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can just go out and pick whatever we
want when we want to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Permaculture doesn't work for us and it
wouldn't have worked for us on our farm
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the drastic inefficiencies that
would have basically been real dollars and
cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I would argue... Well, first off,
I want to say that I love your philosophy
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a similar boat in the sense that I
believe that all of these groups,
[SPEAKER_00]: including permaculture, are all on the
same path and there's many ways to grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and KNF being one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea that we can all go in the
same direction and maybe pull and use
[SPEAKER_00]: information from all of these without
throwing science out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's an important aspect of all
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that taking a scientific approach
to something like nature is very doable
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not mutually exclusive
approaches or ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of permaculture, just from my own
experience, I would almost want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's an inefficient permaculture
design because really the way I see
[SPEAKER_00]: permaculture, it's all about design.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about patterns and utilizing the
resources that you have in whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: location or project that you're working
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If spinach harvest is part of your
revenue, then you need to utilize a design
[SPEAKER_00]: that will make it efficient for you to
harvest that spinach so that your overall
[SPEAKER_00]: processes can be maximized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every permaculture is a food forest
because food forest may not make sense
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what your overall goal for
that property is, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love permaculture and I like all the
principles in it because I feel like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: an observation of nature and using how
nature works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why does the tree in permaculture help
the overall production?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit trees?
[SPEAKER_01]: The tree aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tall canopy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I guess, strong enough in
permaculture to really be able to answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was rhetorical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trees take this incredible strength
they have as they grow and they create
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships, soil-food web, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They create relationships with their root
tips and they turn to that fungal network
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way that some of the lower plants
don't do as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just really good at creating
partnerships with fungus at their root
[SPEAKER_01]: tips and they're such a big organism that
all that photosynthesis and energy and
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange really tends to the whole area.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a result, the whole area is benefited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea of getting the taller tree
and it benefiting or helping with the
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity in the soil is a great concept
and it's a true observation of nature and
[SPEAKER_01]: the partnering with how nature works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a farmer, if I can get that
diversity of microbial life and tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: that microbial life by bringing in the
diversity of the forest and helping it get
[SPEAKER_01]: established in my farmland and then just
tending to it being established,
[SPEAKER_01]: just helping it stay kind of vibrant in my
soil, then I can get the benefit of the
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity of microbial lives without
needing a forest in my farm to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I think permaculture has
got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, as a row crop farmer, I can get
that effect by bringing in a indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial highly diverse mix, then I might
go that route rather than tending trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're trying to imitate some of the
benefits that you would get from
[SPEAKER_00]: something, some of these permaculture
designs or a food forest, but in more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional agricultural design that's
more efficient for harvesting is
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially what I'm- Efficiency,
yeah, efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So science is the study of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't partner with nature and do it
scientifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science is just learning from and studying
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've deviated in thinking science and
nature are one because we've gotten off
[SPEAKER_01]: into the production of chemicals or
whatnot, but all those polymers and
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals, they're all based on principles
we learned from nature, what nature's
[SPEAKER_01]: already doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, all those things you mentioned,
soil, food, web, biodynamics, they've all
[SPEAKER_01]: observed something about nature and are
just trying to emulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that note, I guess I should have
been more specific in terms of saying
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific method instead of just science
in the sense that we're controlling for a
[SPEAKER_00]: variable and observing the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something that can be
applied to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that I really do
believe in when it comes to really
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding how something works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause my brain's the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to know more about the how and
why rather than just the process itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess my problem I have,
and this is not with KNF and this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily with any of these sort of
different methods, but some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fanaticism that I see when people say that
maybe KNF is the way that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or biodynamics or soil food web or
whatever type of methodology to the
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusion of the other methods to me,
that's, I really struggle with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it can almost feel cultish in some
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't necessarily seen that with
KNF, but I have seen it with some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your experience or thoughts on all
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in natural farming or creating
natural farming as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people, especially in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, as a farmer, just saying,
I had to just say, you know what,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to figure out if this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it works and makes, where we can be
productive farmers, then there's a reason
[SPEAKER_01]: for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't just pick it up as my religion or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't work for us to be farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't work for the world to
change and have increase in quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: food either.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pitch to take and go to a conventional
wheat farmer or corn farmer and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I got this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really good for the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should go out of business little by
little over the next 10 years to jive with
[SPEAKER_01]: my philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a hard sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep doing what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I say, hey, I make more money than
you, and my crops better, and I have more
[SPEAKER_01]: time with my family, I think you should
check out what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a much easier sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us in the farm in Hawaii, our industry
hasn't gotten into it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really understand what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like the look of our trees and our
crops, but they don't really know what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to speak in China, actually,
in October, if I can submit my PowerPoint
[SPEAKER_01]: before they yell at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're the International Mechanism
Symposium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's held in China this year, and they
asked me to speak about what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: accomplished on our trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of the leaders in the
international community came out and saw
[SPEAKER_01]: our trees and were like, what is going on
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, it can't be just a philosophy,
or farmers can't get behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this is a movement of farmers,
then I think farmers have to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it has to equate for a farmer to
increase production, or time, or quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to, or it's like, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as each individual group,
it's what people know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't get behind something they don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's their livelihood, that they're
making money from the selling of their
[SPEAKER_01]: idea, then they also don't want to nod any
other idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that might threaten, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when somebody knows something,
and they don't know something else,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's just normal to say, oh,
this is good, and I don't know about all
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or to even be antagonistic toward
something else, because they just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's human conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all kind of on a similar path in
terms of these natural farming and these
[SPEAKER_00]: different methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I would venture to say,
as you come to understand them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, as you come to
understand the how and why behind some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these practices, which I want to talk to
you about next, maybe you can pick and
[SPEAKER_00]: choose the ones that are best fitting for
your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some good cannabis friends that
are growers and excellent growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they use certain aspects of KNF in
their gardens, and it works really well
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not doing everything the way a
Korean natural farmer might do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've definitely pulled aspects
because they've taken the time to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand what those particular
inputs and things will, the effects that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll have on their plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, there's some aspects to
each one of these that probably aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: super good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or that given a change could be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the part that if somebody
defends it just because it's something
[SPEAKER_01]: they do or something they know,
that's where nothing... I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay on a ship that I know has a hole in
it just because it's got my name on the
[SPEAKER_01]: side or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if we can be honest as we
learn, I think that's the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole world's learning right now
that there's a whole lot more to the
[SPEAKER_01]: interconnectivity of nature than we knew
as a scientific community, and that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a long journey ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as each group or camp learns,
oh, this actually isn't very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're honest about that and we can
adapt and move forward, then I think it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be a lot of fun to see what kind of world
our kids get to do and play with in
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, we're all promoting
organic farming and healthier ways to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: food locally, and that's better for the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, we're all on the
same side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd totally agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just switching directions here,
can we talk a little bit, and maybe we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get into this on another podcast or
something down the road, but can you give
[SPEAKER_00]: us just a general idea of some of the
inputs with KNF and sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophies specific to KNF?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the philosophies are like a
similarity of plants to humans in life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, in kind of ebbs and flows of
nutritional needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the ways that that
philosophy plays in the practical kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: work for a farmer is the idea that we need
a little bit of nutrients or the right
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of nutrients at the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so philosophy-wise, we're not up front
loading with all the plants' nutritional
[SPEAKER_01]: needs from day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're tending to the kind of changing
needs of our plants based on its growth
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of Canada's farmers understand
that concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in creating natural farming,
it applies to corn to trees to lettuce all
[SPEAKER_01]: across the board and the whole infancy and
the low nutritional needs and then
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative growth, a changeover period
where there's kind of a morning sickness
[SPEAKER_01]: like a human has, and then reproductive
growth and all the ways you observe your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and feed it accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty central in the feeding of
green natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concept of using indigenous microbes,
the balance and diversity that works or
[SPEAKER_01]: has worked for kind of untended for
thousands of years in the undisturbed
[SPEAKER_01]: forest or kind of land in the surrounding
area is what will self-perpetuate on the
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that idea of getting the thriving kind
of soil food web or microbial life from
[SPEAKER_01]: your area and applying it in your area is
a central idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, there's kind of the microbial
input, which is indigenous microorganism,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that process is pretty detailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the kind of nutritional
and seed aspect of green natural farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a variety of inputs that are able
to be soil drenched in or taken into
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to get into all the inputs
because I know it's a rather complex
[SPEAKER_00]: subject and there's a lot that goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if someone really wants to learn,
they're going to have to do more research
[SPEAKER_00]: than they can pick up in listening to a
podcast for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to give them a taste of sort of
the philosophy of it, which I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what we're talking about
here is locally sourced nutrient inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: and essentially locally sourced
microorganisms as sort of the two main
[SPEAKER_00]: drivers for KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that you can use things that you
might otherwise think of as waste or kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of low value become pretty valuable or
usable in the natural farming farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like on our farm, everything,
all of our byproducts now are really cared
[SPEAKER_01]: for because we didn't do so much with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They become so usable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so our farm has become kind of a
real recycler of local inputs and user.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I mean, when we're on an
island in the middle of the Pacific,
[SPEAKER_01]: not shipping things in can really equate
dollars and cents as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that makes a ton of sense because
we're reducing our environmental impact
[SPEAKER_00]: with fossil fuels and getting material out
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to save a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I totally get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you give me an example that say
someone on the mainland might use of a
[SPEAKER_00]: waste product nutrient source that KNF is
recycling back into a beneficial input on
[SPEAKER_00]: their soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the, yeah, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fermented plant juice is a input in
Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plant food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a ferment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the misconceptions that's seen
online is that we have to get like store
[SPEAKER_01]: bought, you know, nice fruit to make
fermented plant juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually not really Korean
natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Philosophy is just something that got a
little changed online.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can go out and get a weed,
quite literally a local invasive or a
[SPEAKER_01]: local just grows everywhere but never
touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always healthy and green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can become a real food source,
not a theoretical food source,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just like people buy kelp,
you know, they get kelp and they use kelp
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're like, wow, I get great results
with kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beneficial biochemicals in any
surviving plant for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant that's thriving, the weed that's
thriving in your zone is able to take up
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients extremely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: For it to thrive there when nobody farms
it, it's just a thing that grows
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere and it's always healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taking up nutrients well and it's
going to be filled with the kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growth hormone and other beneficial
biochemicals that plant actually benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not pretend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of in the world of cutting edge
research that a lot of your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are looking at now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know that plants have these
biochemicals that can help other plants
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know exactly how it works yet
and they're trying to isolate them and
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out how each one works
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can just take this concept of
using the new growing tips or kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: thriving fresh plant and fermenting it and
getting out that nutrient and then
[SPEAKER_01]: applying it to your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden your Iceland or your Ivy
or your rhubarb or a hundred other kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed type things in your area become a
resource that actually equates to
[SPEAKER_01]: production on your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're taking a healthy biomass from
whatever plants are thriving in your local
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fermenting it and making it into
a liquid nutrient essentially?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my initial thought on that is many
weeds, just tissue testing and things are
[SPEAKER_00]: quite low in macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're getting a lot of trace
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned kelp and kelp's
wonderful for the reasons that you do get
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 different trace elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get plant growth hormones and
regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a ton of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been widely studied, but not terribly
high in NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are you thinking that the main benefit
from these things then would be trace
[SPEAKER_00]: elements or mineral nutrients that are a
little bit smaller and maybe lacking in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil or lacking in the plant's ability
to take them up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have all kinds of theories and I can
tie it to a lot of current research in
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of realm of how they're taking
these plants from the desert that grow
[SPEAKER_01]: like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're extracting these specific
biochemicals combining with other similar
[SPEAKER_01]: properties and other plants and then
applying it to plants and getting these
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And exactly what's going on there and why
plants respond like that to these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of the people
researching them understand aspects,
[SPEAKER_01]: but how they work together, how that might
help a plant with its root zone or its
[SPEAKER_01]: interconnectivity with the soil food web
or any number of things, its uptake of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, its ability for the microbes in
its root zone to uptake nutrients or
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of questions that we're
all as a community of researchers asking
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I like in playing in nature is
that I've held on to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's actually a core natural
farming principle, but we started it
[SPEAKER_01]: before we knew natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've held on to that thing that
happened on our farm where I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, I'm going to know nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a lifetime growing up with
experts in my field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to check that knowledge at the
door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I throw it away because farming
knowledge is awesome and it all interacts
[SPEAKER_01]: with and applies in using green natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to say it's okay to not know
and learn something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so empty mind is a core kind of
philosophy in natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very kind of Asian thought,
but it's helpful because it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, imagine for a moment that you don't
know everything about what you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about or what you farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine for a moment that that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: What might you learn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what might you be up for trying to see
how it works or succeed in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So exactly why new growing tips of ideas
for a vibrant plant in your area equate to
[SPEAKER_01]: a real response in a plant when combined
with the vinegar and oriental herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient, which is something we make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And vinegar micronizes or helps water
particles and the uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why all of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why plants responded like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I have ideas and things I've read
that's like, oh, wow, that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're learning about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of this is research that we're
going to get to watch come to fruition
[SPEAKER_01]: over the next 10, 20 years where we
actually understand how this all works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I totally agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much we don't know about the
soil and about how plants utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in the soil that we're still
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's entirely possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's okay not to know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I don't think we need to
be afraid to say we don't know or to still
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do something as long as we're
being open-minded, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: to learning more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we learn down the way that maybe it
wasn't the, and this may not be the best
[SPEAKER_00]: example, but maybe you were getting the
results because of the vinegar or because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the particular water or one of the
other inputs, then you can adapt and
[SPEAKER_00]: improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I doubt that this is the best
example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that sort of philosophy of
always wanting to learn and applying
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific method to what you're trying so
you can really find out what's making a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in that plant's health is
really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what you just said, the scientific
method, everybody's like, oh, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I just throw all this stuff in a bucket
and put it on, they're like, my plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: super healthy this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, would they have been
healthy this year if you didn't do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the idea of side-by-side trials and
the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we played with a lot of that
over the years on the farm because I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't understand what I could change and
what was helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Elaine Ingham actually, coming to,
again, my tiny town in Hawaii and teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: us to use the microscope and make
qualitative assessment was a huge key for
[SPEAKER_01]: me to, in this journey in natural farming,
to be able to change things based on what
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of microbial growth and life and
diversity I was seeing under the
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually came in, again,
at just the right time when I was asking
[SPEAKER_01]: those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I want to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two things that I really want
to talk about with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one would be indigenous
microorganisms, since this is such a key
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of KNF, the idea of sourcing and
using local microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave you the example when we were
talking earlier offline about how Steve
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon talks, he's a mineral nutrient
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's not as big on soil biology,
but he's really big about remineralization
[SPEAKER_00]: of soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote a book called The Intelligent
Gardener, which is a really good book on
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization and understanding soil
testing for people that are looking to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing he talks about that really
resonated with me was the idea that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: farming on land that was exceedingly low
in calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his crops were suffering and they
were low in calcium as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't know this at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's composting those crops and he's
eating those crops primarily and his
[SPEAKER_00]: health is starting to go downhill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he was finding was when he took
that compost that he was making and then
[SPEAKER_00]: applied it back to the land, he was really
just compounding his problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if what was limiting, the biggest
limiting factor to growth in his soil was
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, and he was applying compost that
was low in calcium, he was just
[SPEAKER_00]: compounding it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was really just compounding his
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would apply this to indigenous
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your soil, if you're using
indigenous microorganisms in a soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: is say deficient or depleted or has the
wrong ratio of microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't bringing in an outside source add
diversity that would either die off and
[SPEAKER_00]: become food sources for your indigenous
microbes, or possibly survive and fill a
[SPEAKER_00]: niche that was previously unoccupied by
the best beneficial microorganism?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the question that you're
asking is kind of two parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solomon's example, which is a great
question and a really interesting one,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how nature works in balance on a
mineral level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see it in seawater, the incredible
diversity of mineral seawater and how it
[SPEAKER_01]: stays in some sort of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually have an example of a guy in
Waimea, Kamuela on the Big Island,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he's a wow farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a tomato farmer, a great tomato
farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he teaches a lot of Hawaiian people to
farm like he does on their land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a cool, cool family, and just
killing it in production of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he doesn't do green natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does organic farming and front loads of
minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lets the crop, he lets the tomatoes
grow, one full crop, and then he replaces
[SPEAKER_01]: them with fresh starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just, he has it dialed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he had a, I think it was sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was atmospheric mineral that just was
destroying his crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he doesn't have this extreme college
background in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: He studied other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he just intuitively said,
I need to balance the minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he loaded up all this other huge,
kind of overloaded the plants way more
[SPEAKER_01]: than he would normally do to balance this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was sulfur that came in through
the rain because of our volcanic ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he loaded up on the other minerals
that balanced or worked in conjunction
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had just the most beautiful crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went, all these plants recovered
and went gangbusters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys from the university system
are like, well, why did you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you add in all these other
minerals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those are way too much minerals or
this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, well, I just seemed right
to balance it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they were suffering from the
imbalance of this, this imbalance that
[SPEAKER_01]: came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he doesn't, he's not apologizing
for not understanding exactly why he's
[SPEAKER_01]: just saying it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there would need to be a lot more
studies that say that's empirical evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: of this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just, I see that in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature wants balance for a lot of the
crops that we would grow or a little,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some crops like a little
imbalance one way or another pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so I could totally see Solomon
kind of playing with those things and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And taking an imbalanced crop and keep
applying it, you perpetuate the imbalance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with soil microbes though,
I think it is actually an entirely
[SPEAKER_01]: different question that's being asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though I recognize that those kind of
connect for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe they are quite the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is totally possible that you could
buy some lab-grown microbe and add it to
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on and that it finds some
niche and stays established.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's totally possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally what we see with microbe-grown,
you know, like Okinawa's microbial life
[SPEAKER_01]: brought in to grow a crop is that it has
incredible results, first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's nothing wrong with buying bugs
in the jug and a soil microbial life from
[SPEAKER_01]: some place that makes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it tends to have about a six months
fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now an indoor grow, I think there's a lot
to study in that and how that all might
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, generally speaking
outdoors, you're going to have this kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of complete dissipation over six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though it totally helps plants grow food
and all you need to do is reapply it to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of get it up again and feed it and
etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea of you using indigenous
microbial life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say I go in and I got cropland and it
was tilled or farmed with putting off just
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals from a different farming method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I come in to farm it and I want to
tend to life the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, bacteria can come in on
the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeast can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungi doesn't as easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I might have a very, very small
range of microbial diversity on that land,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though the surrounding area might be
rich or untouched.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a soil scientist out where we farmed
in Hawaii and he was studying the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference of 100 feet away from each
other and downhill 100 feet or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from the fence line.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the fence line with the divider on
one side of the fence line and had been
[SPEAKER_01]: farmed in sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a pretty intensive and not always
very holistic farming practice done on the
[SPEAKER_01]: islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the other side, it had never been
in crop production.
[SPEAKER_01]: There had been cattle on it, but it had
never been kind of the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of soil microbial diversity
for the soil life was, I forget the exact
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers, but it was major.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 10 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as different microbes, and we're
talking literally 100 feet in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: area and the same rainfall, barometric
pressure, everything just on the other
[SPEAKER_01]: side of the fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as much as there's been rain and
animals traveling, a lot of that microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: life didn't bounce back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't just come from that uphill spot
and move back into this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea of transferring indigenous
microbes is something where we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: helping to take soil food web or the
microbial thriving life of fertile zone
[SPEAKER_01]: and bring it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't just pick one spot in natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get it from 10 different
spots in the local area where it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: untouched microbial diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hoping for exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping that some of it might be the
exact same thing that already exists on my
[SPEAKER_01]: land, but some of it might be something
that actually needs a little assistance to
[SPEAKER_01]: move back in because it doesn't just blow
in on the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we bring in some soil from our farm
and hopefully some from just outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we try and cultivate and collect
indigenous microbial inoculum from the
[SPEAKER_01]: local area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, hoping that it does kind of fill
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't mean that there's not
another way to get some increased
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial diversity or that some things
that somebody grows in a lab wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: establish in some places.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's very slight differences in
varieties of microbes and what those
[SPEAKER_01]: differences equate to and how they
interconnect with other microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really understand all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much we don't know about the
soil food web and nutrient cycling in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and the rhizosphere that we still
have to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess in terms of indigenous
microorganisms versus outside sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: my thought was not so much man-made or
man-propagated microbial sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: but rather compost teas or extracts or
things like that, because they've done
[SPEAKER_00]: research that shows that soil microbes are
relatively ubiquitous in that 99 point
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever percent of them are found
worldwide, but in different diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And slightly different in makeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea that you're sourcing from
different areas around, say, an island
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, I think that makes a lot of
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's all how you define
indigenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're talking about just within your
property, then I wonder if that is enough
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it's not really a question we
can answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In natural farming, you don't just go
within your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go 500 feet up in elevation if
possible and definitely to places as
[SPEAKER_01]: little disturbed for as many thousand
years as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have heard that argument before or
that comment regarding these, let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: say bugs and jugger, outside microbial
sources when they're added in as not
[SPEAKER_00]: persisting in new areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's something that I've
never seen really good data on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you were to say that you apply a
particular microbe species like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lactobacillus, for example, and it
persists for the life of that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when that crop dies and something
else comes in the soil, then it disappears
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have to reapply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could totally get behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea that it would last for around
six months and then suddenly have a die
[SPEAKER_00]: off without any environmental change,
I just don't understand why that would
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's lasting for six months,
that's successive generations of any
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial colony at that point or species
being relatively healthy and surviving and
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducing.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you've touched on something
that is probably wrong in my language.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six months is far too much of a
generalization for any real science talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just want to place a delicate
foot on the term six months, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think exactly which microbe and which
bugs in the jug and how it persists in
[SPEAKER_01]: which environment, those are all going to
be completely needing to be looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard this generalization,
not just from you, but from other people,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly soil food web people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really just asking the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to pass judgment one way or
another on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just my initial thought regarding
it, the idea that if something is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: persist, it either will persist or it
won't persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not persisting, it's only
going to last.
[SPEAKER_00]: A matter of a day or two would be my
thought before it either ran out of food
[SPEAKER_00]: sources or got eaten by another microbe in
the soil, because we're primarily adding
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, if that's what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't have a total understanding
of this, but as far as just to try and
[SPEAKER_01]: help wrap around some of the possible
environmental changes that can occur on a
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say something comes in and maybe your
land is needing some conditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little hard or there's not a lot of
thriving life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you bring in something like a
lactobacillus strain, something in that
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they break up the soil and you're
feeding them in conjunction with that and
[SPEAKER_01]: watering and kind of putting in this crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then some of the things that were there
but maybe weren't thriving get up to speed
[SPEAKER_01]: too, because now your soil is more
aerated, the earthworms have some stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: getting better or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The indigenous guys tend to beat out for
territory things that maybe don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: it isn't their favorite zone, maybe not
temperature, maybe whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: rainfall, moisture, dryness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my understanding is that there's a
losing out to the locals that happens in
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of just competing for space in the
soil column.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how I've understood it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not something that we can
necessarily settle today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much, like you said,
there's so much we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to have a discussion about
it because I think it's an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard these things said and I
just was curious to hear another idea on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing that I'm curious to get
your opinion on is I hear, especially from
[SPEAKER_00]: soil food web people, this idea of
microbial ratios, your fungal to bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio being what decides- It's your
overall soil health and plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by adjusting this, that's how you
really control, that is the controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: variable for plant health and soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I haven't really been
able to get my brain around as I've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned more over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's sort of where I started in
this industry with my father, but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, and I don't want to use the word
evolved because I don't think that's fair,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would say I've changed my
perspective a little bit into looking more
[SPEAKER_00]: at minerals and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their effects on soil health as well
and how all of these things sort of work
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've heard a lot of claims from
certain consultants or certain
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophies around the idea that if your
fungal to bacteria ratio is right,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else gets corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your experience or thoughts with
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the things that just to touch
on that you kind of nodded to is one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest hole in all of this of our
understanding is in the realm of
[SPEAKER_01]: interconnectivity and or interrelations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of our study in the microbial
world, in the world of how that microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with plants and all this stuff
has been on this kind of older concept or
[SPEAKER_01]: concept that I don't think we're going to
be able to keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is isolation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has a role.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to, we need to understand the
microbe individually, but we isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: individual microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to figure out what their
function is, how they work, how they
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute to this overall idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't actually understand how they
work in community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have like the data processing,
the ability to track interconnectivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are technologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't understand how these complex
groups of microbial organisms interact on
[SPEAKER_01]: a level with the nutrients in the soil and
how they help each other or serve each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole zone of understanding is pretty
dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start like, looking at one thing as
science, scientists or different,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, camps of understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, well, I understand this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've studied it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this might be the whole answer,
but really we have this soil column in any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of soil grown crop land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's full of all kinds of stuff and,
and bigger organisms and smaller organisms
[SPEAKER_01]: and plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's synthesizing and pushing things
down in the soil and the exchanges that
[SPEAKER_01]: happen there and how it all works together
is where we really need to grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's where the big hole is
because we don't understand how all the
[SPEAKER_01]: yeast and bacteria work together on the
leaf of the plant to actually do
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that interact with the do and
when it falls in the drip line,
[SPEAKER_01]: what does that do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And who's benefiting or how the yeast and
the bacteria and the fungi work together
[SPEAKER_01]: to process and deal with minerals and make
them plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, those, those areas of
interconnectivity is where the Star Trek
[SPEAKER_01]: would be going if they were a soil
microbial frontier explorer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're, we're just beginning there to
ask the right questions and to have tools
[SPEAKER_01]: to answer those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but in the, in the world of fungal
bacterial ratios and how that benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, I think it's a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think each plant has its ideal zone as
far as fungal to bacterial ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that evidenced, you know,
for a long, long time in my personal life,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing up as a farmer's kid and getting
to play with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I've actually, done a bunch of
research on that front and seen incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: results when messing with the fungal
bacteria ratios and what plants die and
[SPEAKER_01]: what plants thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost killed five acres of trees once
by messing with this in the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I understood it, I took a,
so when I got into natural farming first,
[SPEAKER_01]: they brought over this machine and I was
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was making it for five acres and with a
ton of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they brought over this machine from
Korea to try and make IML on a large
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, if I can just buy
this stuff, that's just, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I bought 20 tons of IML machine,
applied it on five acre block of trees and
[SPEAKER_01]: I nearly killed them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they all turned the craziest
yellow like overnight, but then a week
[SPEAKER_01]: they were all like, it looked like I had
just started them of water and all
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients combined for over a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else in the orchard is green
and thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only where I applied this inoculum did I
see these trees like nearly croak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so then I, that was the time,
that was the moment when I realized I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't leave understanding this stuff to
anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if the experts are giving me stuff
that are going to kill my crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not, no one was expert at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: People didn't know what they're doing,
but so I dug into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a microscope and I looked like what
is in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was made in 24 hours in a,
in a boiler system kind of machine that my
[SPEAKER_01]: trees weren't having it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, there was nothing happy about
this scenario for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it was is I took a kind of stable
soil environment that was far more
[SPEAKER_01]: fungally leaning than this inoculum I put
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just housed it with straight
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a tree farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when trees not happy and those
trees were not happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, I just messed with the
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't put poison on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't, there wasn't any real
nutrients in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was simply an inoculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I almost killed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the flip side of that, the University
of Hawaii's research and development has
[SPEAKER_01]: granted me money to research a project I
did where I took this invasive that's
[SPEAKER_01]: killing all the cows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I theorized that it actually
does, is a bacterial loving plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: because when we were conventional in our
herbicide strips, herbicide the type we
[SPEAKER_01]: were using, it
[SPEAKER_01]: deoxygenates the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reduces the ability for soil oxygen
transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it kills all the fungus and
everything that loves the oxygen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if it kills everything,
the first thing to come back to bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: and the first plant to thrive in these
herbicide strips we use to get the trees
[SPEAKER_01]: off the ground or the nuts off the ground
with our ground harvesters was this
[SPEAKER_01]: fireweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always the first thing in the
strips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, they love crazy
bacterial imbalance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it only messes with a real kind of
surface and soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not this complete devastation of,
but it's pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so we don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our trees are happier for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I did for a cow farmer,
a rancher, I got him on this two acre kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of obby parcel that he had no more grass
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: All he had was fireweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got these folks to do all this stuff to
it that wasn't gonna change anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, he was a friend of
our family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went in and I brought a highly fungal
inoculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just applied it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I seeded some grass where it had
kind of been grassless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I watched.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the period of three months,
all the fireweed died.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got predated on by aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would go out and look.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't pull any of those two acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna pull all the weeds in two
acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's miserable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went out and looked at it and it
would be powdery mildew and just wilting
[SPEAKER_01]: and dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you looked at it right where it met
the soil, be all covered in aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happened is this plant just
became the weakest thing in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the grass went gangbusters,
went ballistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually was able to run four cattle on
two acres for two years in a row because
[SPEAKER_01]: he couldn't keep up with grass production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've since told him that's not a good idea
for sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does his own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's his land.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right on the other side of the fence
where we didn't apply IML, the neighbor's
[SPEAKER_01]: pasture still was the exact same problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still was solid fireweed as far as you
can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had UH Extension agent come out,
University of Hawaii Extension agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come out and look at this and watched it
over four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so we're running a trial right now
to show that empirically so that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: use that to help farmers on the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've spent millions of dollars trying
to fix the fireweed problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fungal bacterial balance, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple thoughts on that and I
want to hear your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I loved what you said there
at first about how much we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: about soil biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot we don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a wonderful soil scientist once
speak and he talked about how we know more
[SPEAKER_00]: about what's going on at the bottom of the
ocean and in outer space than we do
[SPEAKER_00]: literally under our feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is symbiotic and you can't take and
isolate one microorganism without looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at all the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we start talking about fungal to
bacterial ratio, to me that feels too
[SPEAKER_00]: simplistic for the reasons you just
stated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that since we don't know what's
going on, the idea that we just take a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil succession chart as soil moves from
highly bacterial towards more fungal and
[SPEAKER_00]: say an old growth forest versus a new
pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wonder if that's not being pushed
more by the plants that are sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea that a grass or a tree is
putting out these exudates to select for
[SPEAKER_00]: the type of microorganisms that it's going
to be most successful with, with trees
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting for a more fungal environment
and the grasses or annual crops selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: for more bacterial environments rather
than us controlling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess on that note, you gave the
example of applying this IMO solution that
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially really hurt your macadamia
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering if it wasn't so much
that the soil had a particular bacteria to
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal ratio, but maybe that the bacteria
you applied was more efficient at
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing the nutrients in that soil for
that period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plant was actually nitrogen
starved or unable to access a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: those, those soil nutrients because,
or possibly that bacteria had so much food
[SPEAKER_00]: source there that it actually created and
generated, you know, an exothermic
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction through reproduction and heated
the soils around the roots of the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would stress it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I wonder if there's other
explanations for it beyond just a strict
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial to fungal ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm fully willing to admit that
these are just my initial thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding, you know, sort of that subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about any of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the potential for there to be
other things specifically on those trees
[SPEAKER_01]: and then yellowing as a result of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible that it was another thing
to observe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think what we have is what we can
observe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like for that crop land or that grass
land, I took myphobia labs of the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: place before I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was an extremely, you know,
bacterially grass land, not suitable for
[SPEAKER_01]: grass production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I took them after and the,
you know, the amoeba increased and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all kinds of other, you know,
cilius increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the big changes was the balance
of fungal to bacterial ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, you can, I mean,
maybe there's an invisible reason in the
[SPEAKER_01]: interconnectivity of all of this that we
don't yet know how to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be the cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think right now what I have to work
with and the power of observation,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at that and saying these
plants don't like it when there's balanced
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, fungally to bacterially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's probably pretty
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And could there be a lot more to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think where we're at in
understanding that it's a pretty good tool
[SPEAKER_01]: now, it might be that we're looking at
some disconnected cause or effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: something more complex that we don't yet
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that it might be just
reasonable to say, yeah, there's something
[SPEAKER_01]: to this fungal to bacteria ratio,
how forests grow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is tough for me because I totally
agree with you on what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I'm cautious about drawing a
conclusion from a result without knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: what all the variables may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we, like for, just to use this
example of this IMO solution that you
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to the macadamia nut trees,
we don't know what it is about that
[SPEAKER_00]: application that caused the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think it's, you know, you believe
it was because of the fungal to bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just suggesting maybe it was from
something else entirely having to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was too acidic or the pH was off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making stuff up at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea that we observe something
with nature and then have to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate it, but also be able to draw the
correct conclusions for what the mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: of action is, I think is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may very well be, like you said,
this fungal to bacteria ratio,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's just, it brings up a sort of a
greater philosophical question for me when
[SPEAKER_00]: we evaluate all of these methodologies and
all of these ideas around farming is all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can go and spray this ungly rich
inoculum and kill fireweed while making
[SPEAKER_01]: grassland increase in fertility,
well then even if I don't understand
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what's going on there,
I've employed the principles of
[SPEAKER_01]: observation and science to come to a
conclusion that I can tend to the fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: life of grassland and kill a noxious weed
while increasing production and thus
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing the dollars in the pocket for a
farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might not need to understand a whole
lot more for effective use of these
[SPEAKER_01]: principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, totally at the end of the day,
it all comes down to plant growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: health and soil growth and health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're obviously a very successful
farmer and have had great success with
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're doing, I think is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the fact you're working with
the university to spread these ideas and
[SPEAKER_00]: get research done on these ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think that's just, that's just
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please don't take any of my suggestions
or comments as a, in any sort of negative
[SPEAKER_00]: way, because that really is not my intent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I enjoy the discussion and I like
trying to figure out the how and why
[SPEAKER_00]: behind what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what we're observing, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that to me is a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's not black and white and
it's not anything that's good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's just, it's, it's
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's something we want to keep
striving towards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in no way offended.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really important to have
those conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I think that what we're going to
come to as we learn and kind of come to
[SPEAKER_01]: right thought or how things actually work,
we're just going to keep partnering with
[SPEAKER_01]: how nature works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think whoever painted nature,
the painter of it has got a pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: touch because the deeper I dig into
looking at it under a microscope and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding some of these
interconnectivity things, the more I just
[SPEAKER_01]: go, wow, it's like a symphony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like literally everybody is playing
their, their tune and, and, and flawless,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of combination,
even, even in degrees of chaos,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where there's like, there's
decomposition and there's new growth and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still like a symphony.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I think what you're saying
is, is, is on where like, what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is nature actually doing and how can
we better partner with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know, I know you have to get going
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can sign off, but I just want to
say, thanks for your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we didn't get, we didn't
totally talk about KNF maybe as much as I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to, or you wanted to, but I'd love
to follow up with you another time and
[SPEAKER_00]: just, and just chat and maybe I'll have
another person on to talk KNF here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me and yeah,
super good talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Chris Trump, a master natural
farmer certified by mastercho of Korea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to the cannabis
cultivation and science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that there's more information
and articles available on our website and
[SPEAKER_00]: blog at www.kisorganics.com as well as
links to the data and information we
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed in this episode on the podcast
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
