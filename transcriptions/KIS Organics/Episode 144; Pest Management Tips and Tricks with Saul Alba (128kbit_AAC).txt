[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before starting the podcast, just a
friendly reminder to check out the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: page at www.kisorganics.com Just click on
the Learn tab, then Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want access to podcasts as soon
as they are recorded along with additional
[SPEAKER_00]: content and video, we do have a Patreon
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also do book clubs, hangouts,
and have a private Discord channel for
[SPEAKER_00]: members.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kiss Organics website also offers
consulting, a variety of soil amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting fixtures, beneficial insects,
and the highest quality commercial soils
[SPEAKER_00]: on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We carefully research all of our products
that we offer and manufacture to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are science-based and meet our
standard of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Saul Alba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saul began his agricultural work in
vineyard and winery operations on the
[SPEAKER_00]: central California coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: After deciding to focus career on crop
protection, he moved north where he
[SPEAKER_00]: managed IPM programs at Monterey Mushroom
Company and Jacobs Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work led to a position as IPM manager
at Harborside Farms where he directed
[SPEAKER_00]: their bio-intensive greenhouse cannabis
IPM program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saul now works as a technical sales
representative for BioB USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Dad, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm excited to have this
conversation with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I met you years ago now when you
were working at another insectary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're with BioB, which I'm really
excited about because I get to work
[SPEAKER_00]: directly with you and also with Kelly
Vance as sort of our technical support
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about what your
current role is with BioB?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the title is, let's see, technical
sales representative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I work obviously getting reaching out
to get more customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my job is really consultative sales,
which is working with the customers to
[SPEAKER_01]: help them design IPM programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, ultimately the goal is move
their IPM to fewer sprays or more
[SPEAKER_01]: compatible sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: More compatible practices so that our
products can be integrated and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: success with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with that, too, I would add
proper application rates of beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and proper timing of application
rates with beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, then just to share with the
audience, if we apply beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier in the growth cycle, you're going
to have more success with them and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: apply lower rates as a general rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know from Suzanne, we've had she's
given me instances where people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: massively over applying beneficial
insects, which hurts your budget,
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it hard to stay in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the other hand, applying the
wrong insect or applying levels
[SPEAKER_00]: inefficient to actually control the target
pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you have a really interesting
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to add that we at BioB with my
team, I like to say we're kind of we're a
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions first approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, the sales important, but it'll it'll
come.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you you show success of your
products with a customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will buy in and they'll also say,
hey, you know, they'll tell their,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, their friends that, you know,
hey, try to talk to this guy or go through
[SPEAKER_01]: bio be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do I mean by success without
control that that's super important to me
[SPEAKER_01]: to define success not only means,
you know, our products helping increase
[SPEAKER_01]: your yields by keeping pests under
control, keeping them under an economic
[SPEAKER_01]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also means keeping it within your
budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that that to me is basically goes hand
in hand with, you know, crop protection
[SPEAKER_01]: within your budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I think sometimes other companies,
they devise programs that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, shotgun type programs,
you know, throw all of this into your crop
[SPEAKER_01]: and you won't see pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably true if you throw every
biocontrol or excessive biocontrol or more
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple biocontrol agents that are going
after the same pest when you may
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily need that many.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a way to win, but you don't
win on the budget side.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's super important that we figure
out how to balance that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I want to touch on is,
you know, when I think of certain target
[SPEAKER_00]: pests like two spotted spider mite,
my brain immediately goes to persimilus or
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats, I think of you know,
SF nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not as simple as just combining,
I guess, a beneficial and a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every you know, one thing Suzanne's really
taught me is that every facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: every grow space, every greenhouse is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about what those
differences are and how that goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: determining what the best option is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's the reason you're you
and I set this up is because you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: my primary crop that I work with and the
crop I know the most about crop protection
[SPEAKER_01]: is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I work with a greenhouse primarily,
but lots of indoor, smaller indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: operations and also outdoor, you know,
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's cool about that is you
get to understand like what the pest
[SPEAKER_01]: complex is really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by that, it's like what really
becomes an issue for different growers in
[SPEAKER_01]: those different settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, for example, outdoors,
grasshoppers might be considered in
[SPEAKER_01]: certain regions the most important pest to
control, whereas in an indoor setting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll never see grasshoppers.
But.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root aphid can pop big in a hydroponic
indoor facility, whereas root aphid is not
[SPEAKER_01]: an issue outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really does kind of depend on lots
of things, climate being one, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and and and yeah, that's that's going to
be that's going to vary based on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, your your particular operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some some really, really low tech
greenhouses don't have the option to to
[SPEAKER_01]: like heat and use use dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their botrytis is, you know,
harder to manage than, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a Dutch style greenhouse where that's
all designed into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, environment, I think,
has the most to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not all practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing practices also have a lot to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growth where you tightly pack the
plants in the growth space are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: usually be more difficult to to manage
pests because, A, it's harder to find the
[SPEAKER_01]: pests in the thicket and B, sprays don't
penetrate well into, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you need to use sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both of those things, you know,
it's a lot harder to if you if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: plants tightly tightly packed,
it's a lot tougher than if you do proper
[SPEAKER_01]: spacing and, for example, do a lot of leaf
removal where it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it's it's just everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything can affect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of living soil customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a particularly challenging setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, from what I've seen,
so everyone has their their different
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I think what I'm grateful for is
that I have a chance to work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the kind of the gamut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so when you see when you walk into a
new grow facility or grow space,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you sort of looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your mental checklist in terms of
IPM specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so usually we start in propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, go from the least likely to be
infested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as through each stage,
you know, basically take notes on what
[SPEAKER_01]: their primary pest is and what and then
find out what they're doing, what they
[SPEAKER_01]: have been doing and if they think why they
think it might be failing or why they
[SPEAKER_01]: think it could be better or why they think
it's doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, obviously listening,
like at least in the first visit,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And note taking that that's important to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then then, you know, then I I look for
things where number one to me is the signs
[SPEAKER_01]: and symptoms of pest presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and so, for example, if it's an indoor
operation under lights with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like those the the the I don't know what
they call the trays where you have a drain
[SPEAKER_01]: one side, you have a decline that decline,
whatever it's called, the slope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the drain on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great place to go look for for
root aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to look in in in substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them crawl out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you irrigate, the water pushes them
down to the drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's kind of one really quick,
you know, you know, it's a good pointer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, leaf damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can if you look around, you'll find
either thrips or spider mite damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, basically quick scouting when I
come into a room, if they'll let me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to like go deep into the crop
until I know that they're not infested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just not just so I don't carry out any any
pests or move them around the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's that's more or less what
I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I then what's super important to
me is a follow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my goal is to get a follow up email
to whoever it is that's responsible for
[SPEAKER_01]: the IPM within a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because things have to stay fresh in their
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we discuss, I have to and then
reiterate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of my my approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you write a recommendation to a
grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily all beneficials
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to clarify that for folks,
because I've seen your recommendations for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers that we work with that you've sent
after maybe visiting the facility or
[SPEAKER_00]: talking through their some of their
challenges with with pest control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me a sample of what something
might kind of look like for someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: was listening to the podcast is unfamiliar
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: One big question I have is what kind of
monitoring are you doing and are you doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it properly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what I'm interested in knowing is
if your population of pests is to a point
[SPEAKER_01]: where I would you would be throwing money
away to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, a common practice in veg
is spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably 75 percent of the people
I deal with prefer to spray for for pests
[SPEAKER_01]: in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all well and good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very few of them that are
implementing biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's something you really have to
learn to do for the entire cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can start integrating it slowly
into veg so that you can reduce your your
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays, because sprays may not be ideal
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may need to know, OK, what's your
thrips population like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might say, well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your yellow cards telling you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing yellow cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, you need to start yellow cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about your fungus net?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing yellow soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, you need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start on that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go with a chemical approach until
you get me some data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to know when we need to speak the
same language.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a much better I mean, I can
communicate with you more because I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to visit your grow weekly
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have data from like from like yellow
cards or if I have, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: counts of spider mites or counts of spider
mite eggs per leaf, you know, that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, then then, you know, if it's if
it's something that I believe biocontrol
[SPEAKER_01]: can't catch up with, then of course,
the strategy is, hey, let's get this down
[SPEAKER_01]: to where biocontrol will do it so that you
can reduce your sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that might take a few sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm I'm fortunate that in part of
my career, when I was first getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: biological control, I decided that I
wanted to learn all of the organic sprays
[SPEAKER_01]: that I had available in California,
all the materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew when to use them or what I could
use and then try them and see how well
[SPEAKER_01]: they worked and basically got familiarity
with a lot of these materials and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before jump diving in head first in the
biocontrol, I went into it slowly so that
[SPEAKER_01]: by the time I got into the cannabis
greenhouse, I had I had a good background
[SPEAKER_01]: of sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also had a background on starting
with bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I was able to integrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, if the so first off,
you need to know what level of pest
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure you have and you need to be able
to quantify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's essentially what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scouting, you know, I know we could do
a whole podcast on that you had mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty in-depth thing to consider
in your in your facility and your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if the pest pressure is above
this threshold where it's going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to be controlled by beneficials,
then we're talking about bringing in you
[SPEAKER_00]: said chemical solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're referring to there,
not necessarily synthetic, but it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: like an organic solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking soaps and oils or maybe a
botanical, some sort of spray option to
[SPEAKER_00]: suffocate, neurologically disrupt,
kill essentially the target pest to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them down to a level that then the
beneficials could potentially control
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, most of the states that have
legalized, they won't allow you to use
[SPEAKER_01]: certain materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost all organic materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hardly think of anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even organic sprays that are like
neurotoxins like spinosad aren't allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: in the majority of states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some states are so strict that they
don't allow you to use an EPA registered
[SPEAKER_01]: organic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm lucky because I focus my pest
management to organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's almost all I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first job I worked in, we did use some
insecticides, some real insecticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was the goal there was go towards
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, it's been all
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know the sprays well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the materials well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't actually know, you know,
the real poisons well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm lucky not to have to ever use
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only can you use them,
but you can actually integrate them if you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some guidance, but that's what I'm
here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the flip side, an example
where you maybe not don't need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays because I hate spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the the labor to, you know,
fill a sprayer, make tank mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything go in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I hate doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I had I had a thrips damage
thrips that came into my room on my
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, they can, I believe,
be paid inside the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't see or lay eggs inside the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see any damage on my plants until
they had grown a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the grower I got them from noticed
thrips damage a couple of weeks after I
[SPEAKER_00]: got my plants from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, OK, you need to start
treating for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did some dips and sprays to try and
get them under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did a release of beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: After, you know, my after after a couple
of rounds of sprays and then then the next
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, I had very little thrips damage
that cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next cycle in that room,
I just preventatively released some SF
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes into the soil because the room
had been empty for a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't see any thrips damage that
next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do like to treat plants when I
first bring them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess my point is if you have a very
low pest pressure or maybe your last
[SPEAKER_00]: round, you had a little bit of pest
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I think beneficials really
shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, especially early in veg,
because you don't have to buy a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: them necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, you know, spraying, like you
mentioned, can't get everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas these beneficials are eating and
working 24 7 and they'll work their way
[SPEAKER_00]: into all the little nooks and crannies of
your of your canopy to really get your
[SPEAKER_00]: target pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, key there in the way to make
biocontrol successful is to realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: it is much, much better as a preventative
tool than than it is as a curative.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some biocontrol agents that
actually can essentially cure a problem or
[SPEAKER_01]: bring it down so that it's so low that,
you know, that it's nowhere it's not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to hurt you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like SF nematodes being one of them,
you can take a greenhouse that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: loaded with fungus gnats and if you use
the SF nematodes properly, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a bit expensive at first, you can get
it down to where, you know, they're not an
[SPEAKER_01]: issue anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is an exception.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, most of most biocontrol works,
you know, and should be used
[SPEAKER_01]: preventatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That means the first sign of pests is when
you is when you really start.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the budget to get just get
them in there before you've even seen any
[SPEAKER_01]: pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, that's even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most growers are going to say,
well, I'm not going to do make an action
[SPEAKER_01]: until I know they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you know when they when they
are at a very low population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you know, I told you earlier,
my mantra is scouting is the basis of
[SPEAKER_01]: success for biological control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing what you have, what pest you
have, where is it and how much of it is
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like key to having biocontrol
succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think I don't think a lot of
I've noticed I have my experiences that
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to other greenhouse crops like
ornamental and food crops and and and
[SPEAKER_01]: foliage crops, the cannabis grower might
miss that concept, might not might not
[SPEAKER_01]: have that ingrained.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Likely because they they were growing
growers during the black market days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before it was so you could just take avid
and wipe out your spider mite issue with
[SPEAKER_01]: one spray or keep it low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're kind of used to more like,
OK, curative, curative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can cure this biocontrol that won't do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics materials won't do that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very rarely curative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of switching that mentality
to I want to I need to do this
[SPEAKER_01]: preventatively based on scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I remember 20 years ago and this is
probably a pretty common story where I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really think about pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wasn't being around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't around any other cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just my own grow in my garage at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I figured I was pretty safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it was just me going in the
room and then I didn't catch it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up getting thrips somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got into the space and I didn't catch
it right away because I wasn't scouting as
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully as I should have at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't really know how to deal with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got I got a little too late to
the game and I hadn't even heard of
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was all I had a lot of learning to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, I'd forgotten about avid and
Eagle 20 and some of these horrible
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistries that people used back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that we have better solutions
now, even if they're not systemic,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is sort of the point of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to end up in your final
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to change directions here and talk
a little bit about russet mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hearing and seeing more issues
with russets as of lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know they've been a problem for
a while, but what are some of your options
[SPEAKER_00]: for russet mites or recommendations,
I guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, I want to make an
announcement on biological control of
[SPEAKER_01]: russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are anecdotal reports out there that
certain predatory mites that are
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially available can help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, my actual experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, if you talk to Suzanne,
I think she's in agreement that there is
[SPEAKER_01]: no reliable conventional commercially
available predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some folks have mentioned the Andersoni
mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's all anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be there, but if you look at it,
you'll see failures of Andersoni,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you'll also won't be able to find any
scientific literature, basically not much,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least showing that Andersoni can help
you with a russet mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's very little literature,
if any, on biological control of hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, now this is going to sound like a
commercial, but it's something I'm excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: BioB began production of a predatory mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the same family as all the rest of
the predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That mite is commonly known as the Western
predatory mite because it's in all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Western states.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scientific name is Gallendromus
occidentalis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Among us, we call them oxys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This mite is primarily going to be using
certain crops and outdoor crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a demand for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is known to be more of a generalist
predatory mite, if I can say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I mean by that is persimilis would
be a very specific predator that focuses
[SPEAKER_01]: on two-spotted spider mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't even feed on and control,
may feed, but it won't control certain
[SPEAKER_01]: species within the same genus as the
two-spotted spider mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's specifically focused on that mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It co-evolved with that mite, is what I
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you have Neosceles californicus,
which I'm sure people have heard of,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will also feed on, for example,
broad mite and might help you manage broad
[SPEAKER_01]: mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's literature showing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the two-spotted spider mite and can
also feed on pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more of a generalist, if you get
what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gallendromus occidentalis, the way I like
to describe it, is that it's the most
[SPEAKER_01]: generalist of the predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're excited because in nature,
it will feed on the area feed family,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the family of pest mites to which
Hempressa mite belongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have it recommended by the
University of California as the go-to for
[SPEAKER_01]: certain area feed species, like,
for example, tomato Russet mite,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is in the same genus as Hempressa
mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our hope is now that we have it,
to be able to basically debut it in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis to see what impacts there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone is interested and has an
existing Hempressa mite problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just about getting ready to launch
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have some production going where we
definitely want to see it feeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: would like to get video of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My colleague already has video of it
feeding on Hempressa mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's clear that they'll eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Controlling it, yet to be seen because
it's never been tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting it out there because we want
to get the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, though, very effective way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, before we get into your current
recommendations around Hempressa,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to touch on a couple of things
that you just mentioned that I think are
[SPEAKER_00]: really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, this is a really big deal because I
remember talking to Kelly Vance about this
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know he's been pushing for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the big reasons that you and
him, I think, ended up at BioB was because
[SPEAKER_00]: you were so excited for this mite and
access to it and what it may offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to throw that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing that you had also
mentioned is control versus feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to highlight that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Russet mites live in the in
the bud within those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very hard to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That area is very hard to navigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same with tomatoes sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this idea that, like I think you
mentioned, Andersoni may feed on Russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, you know, in a Petri dish or or
something, but maybe not able to control
[SPEAKER_00]: it and navigate that space as well as a
Russet or effectively enough to control in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense of keeping populations low
enough not to have economic damage to your
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're we're we're hopeful you're
hopeful that Gallandromus will be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that based on the literature and what
you guys have seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's an important
distinction between something that's able
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed something and on something and
something that's able to feed on it so
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively that it's able to control it
below an economic threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that Suzanne preaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very glad she, you know,
highlights that just because an animal can
[SPEAKER_01]: feed on another animal doesn't mean it
would control an infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've seen the videos,
but there's a video of a deer eating a
[SPEAKER_01]: bird literally just sticks and eats it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are herbivores.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not supposed to be doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that you would buy a deer to
to get rid of like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bird pest problem in your on your right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tricky part is that it is often
crop dependent and also dependent on other
[SPEAKER_01]: factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, just because it can control
something in this crop doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: mean it will control that same pest in
another crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just because it has been shown to
control a pest in your particular crop
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean it will do it in every case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give you the primary example for
that is Ampliceus cucumeris.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cucumeris mite, which I'm sure
people are aware of, an inexpensive mite,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the least expensive predatory
mite out there, used for thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: management, very successfully used for
thrips management, but also successfully
[SPEAKER_01]: used for broad mite or cyclamen mite in
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of literature showing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it does not prefer broad mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would rather eat thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens when you have a thrips
infestation along with a broad mite
[SPEAKER_01]: infestation?
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not get biocontrol unless
potentially you just inundate it so that
[SPEAKER_01]: now the cucumeris is like everyone wants
to, you know, the steak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone gets the steak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody has to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to eat the broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so they may be preferential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, the gallendromis,
I know you had mentioned to me that they
[SPEAKER_00]: also like two-spotted spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a two-spotted infestation
along with a russet mite infestation,
[SPEAKER_00]: your hypothesis was that they would
probably control the two-spotted first
[SPEAKER_00]: just because they're larger and maybe more
delicious in the eyes of gallendromis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you, if you think about it,
so just some, some research, if you look
[SPEAKER_01]: at what Cornell University has to say
about gallendromis, oxytocin, talus,
[SPEAKER_01]: in certain crops like, like, uh,
uh, pome fruit and, and, um, stone fruit,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will feed on the, you know,
the respective russet mite of those crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those crops also get a, a,
a bunch of other, you know, other pest
[SPEAKER_01]: mites from the tetranichid family,
which is the same one that two-spotted
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mite belongs to and several other
non-tetranichid larger mites that are
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially more nutritious, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have that infestation going on,
it could fail for the russet mite in your
[SPEAKER_01]: tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a clean, if you,
if you've got a clean crop with no other
[SPEAKER_01]: like preferable food, there's a better
chance that it can help you with russet
[SPEAKER_01]: mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my thoughts on it is, you know,
getting your populations of two-spotted
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, um, your thrips population as low as
possible, then there's a better chance
[SPEAKER_01]: that gallendromis, oxytocin, talus can
help you with russet mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, I have to say as
kukumeris can help you with, with broad
[SPEAKER_01]: mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we need people like you to
offer, you know, technical support for
[SPEAKER_00]: this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's a lot to know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of research that goes
into it and expertise that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people like myself even don't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pick up all that I can from you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but at the end of the day,
if I need, or if I need a recommendation,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, or I have an infestation, I'm going to
come to you and get, get some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on that note, uh, specifically,
let's just stick with russets,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, since we've been talking about them,
what would be a more traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation for russets knowing that,
uh, there has not historically been any
[SPEAKER_00]: biological options that control russet
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, back when I started at harborside
farms as IPM manager, this was,
[SPEAKER_01]: this was 2017, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I walked into a russet mite wildfire
and I did not know that pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was from organic herbs, never dealt with
an area of feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, first thing I did is what are your
scouting reports about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean scouting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, do you have scouts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have people that reported this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they carry loops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this was at the point where we were,
where we didn't have anything like what is
[SPEAKER_01]: set up, for example, in an ornamental
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you can't see them without a loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So immediately busted out my loop,
started looking, found them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what russet mites like,
okay, what have you been using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've been using this oil and this
oil and this oil, but it's not,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't seem to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me dive in, dove into the,
its closest relative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's, that is a pest in another crop
is a tomato russet mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: The go-to for them was elemental sulfur
sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it works for them, that relative,
it should work for us in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that was the first, first sort of
step in the, in the direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what we didn't know at the time was
how concentrated your spray had to be and
[SPEAKER_01]: what frequency you had to apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's negatives to spraying
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but eventually came around to figuring
out exactly what the rate and frequency of
[SPEAKER_01]: the sprays should be to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other techniques that I learned
subsequent to that, to help, to have you
[SPEAKER_01]: manage, um, hemp russet mite relatively
easy with elemental sulfur sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still believe that if it comes to a
spray, and I think that probably a good
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the cannabis community would agree
with me, at least those that have battled
[SPEAKER_01]: it, that you're better off with a sulfur
spray than you are with an oil spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there's disagreement, but I think
I, what I run into more is success with
[SPEAKER_01]: using elemental sulfur sprays,
but there are drawbacks to using sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few really important drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we, we originally recorded this
whole podcast and I think 15 or 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, uh, turned into talking about the
pros and cons of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, unfortunately we lost the recording,
uh, due to technical issues, but let's,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's, let's do a little bit of a pros and
cons around sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you, you, and the last time we did
it, you took the pro side and I took the
[SPEAKER_00]: con side and we kind of talked about what
those were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've heard some, I've heard from
Suzanne why she does not like sulfur as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as you do, but, um, it is very
effective in certain instances dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with certain pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dive into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the advantages and
disadvantages of using sulfur?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's talk a little bit about,
uh, burning sulfur, which technically I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think is allowed legal in any crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, let's have a short conversation
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just knowing that it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then also, and then more
familiarly with the, uh, wettable sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm burning sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, it was very, very commonly
practiced.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still devices for it, um,
in greenhouses, but at least in
[SPEAKER_01]: California, um, I guess, uh, whoever or
whatever agency is the in charge of like
[SPEAKER_01]: fires and you know, whoever manages the
fire departments at the top of the state,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, said no more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way too risky to leave these hot
lamps in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had too many instances, incidences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's actually the reason why it was,
um, outlawed, at least here in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was very effective for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that forced the growers to go a
different direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I believe if you want to be compliant
in most states, you can't burn sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, that's the big F some
people don't care about being compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it is more if it's probably more
efficient to use it, to burn it than it is
[SPEAKER_01]: to spray it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, it's an effective
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a vapor form, it covers the entire,
um, greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be less effective, more efficient,
but less effective for a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's my take on burning sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as pros and cons of using sprayable
sulfur, I'm going to start with the cons
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think are legitimate cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so number one and most important to me
is we don't know what impact the sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: residue has on the ability of biological
control agents to hunt for their prey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be disruptive because it is
volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these predators use olfactory
cues to find their prey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could interrupt us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a very legitimate, uh,
concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, let's just, uh, clarify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying after spraying sulfur,
uh, and waiting, I don't know if a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days or whatever week you bring in your
beneficial insects, you're saying there
[SPEAKER_00]: still could be some volatizing sulfur in
the coming off of that leaf surface that
[SPEAKER_00]: may make it hard for those beneficials to
track down their predators because they
[SPEAKER_00]: use their sense of smell and this sulfur
is still creating an odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, we don't have any research
to know either way on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nothing really legitimate yet,
just anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's not that it can stick around.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a few days, it does stick around for a
few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, in my prose, I will mention
why that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in my anecdotal experience where I've
seen it used, seen sulfur used,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have encountered a very robust
biocontrol management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my experience, it didn't seem to
impact the predatory mites we were using
[SPEAKER_01]: and the parasitoid wasps we were using or
the lacewing, um, aphids and, and thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: and spider mites were being managed by
predators after a sulfur spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean you have to go in with a
higher number of predators immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: after a sulfur spray or a more frequent
release until that sulfur dissipates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe that's what it means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's my take on, on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a legitimate concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the research point saying
one or the other yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do know that the recommendations
from those that have done research,
[SPEAKER_01]: like to say, wait four days before
releasing predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know where they got that,
um, the four days from it, but it is based
[SPEAKER_01]: on research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's less about can it,
um, can it hunt properly more like do you
[SPEAKER_01]: put them at risk if you release between
four within the net within four days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, that's what I have on,
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's, that's a legitimate concern
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other concern that's really important
is using oils is effective for a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of, of pests in cannabis, um, not desired
in certain stages, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe week three of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're talking about something that
might be hurting you more than helping
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so like I said, maybe a good 75% of
the cannabis growers I've worked with do
[SPEAKER_01]: use oils and veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using oils and veg is effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be some drawbacks to using oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some, some growers believe that
they block stomata.
[SPEAKER_01]: So photosynthesis is, um, reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growth is reduced and plant health is
reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then there's also the possibility of
phytotoxicity using oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where another legitimate concern
is with sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at most sulfur materials,
they do not recommend using an oil spray
[SPEAKER_01]: next to a sulfur spray that you've got to
give it a 30 day wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, that's been more like a
two week wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that p that folks are using lower
rates of sulfur, um, it could even be less
[SPEAKER_01]: than, but that it does complicate the use
of oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's a practice that you already
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, another con, which you brought up last
time to the very legitimate is that all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the EPA registered, uh, mitocidal
fungicidal sulfur products have a 24 hour
[SPEAKER_01]: restricted entry interval.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, cause the growers and the
workers can't go into the crop for 24
[SPEAKER_01]: hours after a spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that interferes with some operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the, the available products can
only be used once a week, according to the
[SPEAKER_01]: label.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is another, another con.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, to all of these cons,
I have ways to clear the hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's good to mention both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So REIs or restricted entry intervals are
very important to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're created for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do we always understand those
reasons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, I think you brought that up last,
uh, last conversation, but, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a facility with liabilities and just
health risks, it's probably best to stick
[SPEAKER_00]: to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in theory, there's research to support
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most states, including California have
whistleblower laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get a different employee that,
that shows you, that learns that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not following REIs, um, that they could,
they could cause a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could get you fined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, because there are
whistleblower laws, employees in an
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural operation are protected by,
by the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they, you know, report lapses in,
you know, the way you handle pesticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's also why you need a pesticides
license as a, as an applicator in
[SPEAKER_00]: California specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, all these things exist for,
for worker safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one other, one other con, since we're
on the con side still, uh, I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring up was you already talked about
residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sulfur is an essential mineral for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it creates those, uh, esters and
alcohols, the sort of that skunky smell
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know we need sufficient in our
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, however, I worry about heavy metals,
potentially spraying heavy metals onto our
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if there's just trace amounts,
let's say two to five parts per million
[SPEAKER_00]: of, uh, lead or arsenic or cadmium on in
that sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I, this is, I'm not saying this
is the case, but it's worth researching
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your product source, because if you
fail for heavy metals, because of a
[SPEAKER_00]: residue that would be, that would be
awful, you know, on a crop because you
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed sulfur or anything that you're
spraying, really, this doesn't apply
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically to silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: This applies to anything that we're
applying to our crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seaweed or to our soil, seaweed and,
uh, anyone using shrimp chitin,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, all of those are, there's a risk of
metals, mercury in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a legitimate concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You beat me to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, it was brought up by Suzanne that
she had a customer who reported who failed
[SPEAKER_01]: for metals, tested their sulfur product
and found that it had had them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so here's what I have to say about
that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm going to go into the, the,
the, the pros afterwards, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that could be a risk of your
particular brand of sulfur having a,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, having heavy metals in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that all being said, I've never
experienced that with any of my customers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I can tell you why it's probably
that I haven't experienced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so another con I can think of is most
states have laws as to what materials you
[SPEAKER_01]: can and can't use the, the, if not all of
the elemental sulfur, how wettable powder
[SPEAKER_01]: products that are available to crops,
all different kinds of crops, including
[SPEAKER_01]: organic crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, our EPA registered and there's none
that I know of in California that are
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed if you're trying to be compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a huge issue there is,
okay, if, if you're using a traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur, elemental sulfur product,
you are in something that's used by,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, strawberry or grape,
grape growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you're likely going to be
non-compliant by using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so yeah, that's big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be compliant, you know,
uh, there's no testing for sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean that you don't want to
be compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, until those laws are changed
based on research, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to be compliant, you want to be
able to sell to the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that is a con.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the pros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you, uh, you're a sulfur guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, but I should preface everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, if Suzanne, if you're watching
this, always remember this preface.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a sulfur guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I recommend it used only very
limited circumstances because of all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all cons because of the majority of
the cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that being said, I'm convinced it is
the best treatment for russet mites and
[SPEAKER_01]: broad mites in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that I can say, I don't believe in
using it unless you've got russet mite or
[SPEAKER_01]: broad mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, several of the growers I work
with have anecdotally reported health
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: To sprays, the sulfur sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it, as my understanding, it can be
absorbed by the foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the other pro or the first pro,
um, I believe it's superior to oils in
[SPEAKER_01]: many regards because oils are a contact
only, um, kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there, there's some herbal oils are
also, also have repellents, repellency,
[SPEAKER_01]: but mainly that mode of action,
the main mode of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sprays is contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't get the oil to contact the
pest, you won't kill it because it'll dry
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One and done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is harder on these two
particular pests because of where they
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get in the crevices and something
so tiny, unless you're using some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: a effective adjuvant to thin out your
spray, they can even be protected by,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, what's the word,
the, the hydrophobicity or the,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the lack of ability to spread in these
tiny crevices or underneath trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the oils are hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to contact them and they don't
last very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas sulfur, what few are aware of is
sulfur is used routinely in grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to work in, in the wine
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned about sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned about its mode of action,
um, some time ago and it has actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: twofold mode of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not that it suffocates the way
oils do, but it's also, um, residual or,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the vapor form of, of, of sulfur also
is toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: My belief is that if you perform a sulfur
spray and you miss a colony of rust,
[SPEAKER_01]: it might, but the residue is there pumping
out, you know, the, the volatiles,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the gas attack can actually have this
residual effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's so effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you don't contact, which is a
kill, the gas can still kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something to really consider oils can't
do that for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of the back to oils, one of the
pros you might say, well, what about the
[SPEAKER_01]: phytotoxicity risk, the 30 days or two
weeks you have to wait between sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's on the label and I've experienced
it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, however, subsequent to me being in
production, growers have figured out some
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies on how to reduce that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best strategy I've seen,
which is, um, really cool is actually to
[SPEAKER_01]: spray your sulfur and wash, wash it off
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, then you're before an oil
spray, you're limiting the residual if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing that, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the time that you use the time between
spray and when you wash it off,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're also removing it so that
effectively removing it from the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface so that you can come in with an
oil spray and that's less risk of burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the other thing that's been learned
more recently is I was using it at rates
[SPEAKER_01]: that were effective based on what I
learned and research, but it turns out
[SPEAKER_01]: that growers over time started using less
and less, less lower rates down to half of
[SPEAKER_01]: what I was using where some, some growers
are having an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So less sulfur residue, easier to wash
off, less, even less risk of burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of my, how I clear that
whole issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to time it properly, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do the right thing so you can
avoid the burn or at least reduce the risk
[SPEAKER_01]: of burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how do I clear the hurdle on of heavy
metals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, first off, again, in my experience,
it's never happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the experience of Suzanne,
she said it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've asked for the name of the product so
that I could do a little dive into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes you suspicious of sulfur being
actually a source of heavy metals is,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, back in the day, sulfur was mined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know there are metals in the,
in the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur was mined, um, and then purified in
whatever process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the risk there is there,
it's very clearly there nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding is the majority of sulfur
that's used in agriculture, it's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: distilled from some other source.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot easily move how can you get to
the vapor point or the gas stage of
[SPEAKER_01]: mercury?
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably need to be on the surface of
the sun to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So distillation probably removes a lot of
that metal, potential metal contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the majority of sulfur products
have that, have, are, are distilled,
[SPEAKER_01]: then maybe you're, you know, it's not such
a terrible con or risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but what you can always do is take
whatever sulfur it is you're using and
[SPEAKER_01]: submit it for metals analysis on a regular
basis and confirm to yourself that,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, in fact, this is clean or even
contact the company and ask for like a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can't, they oftentimes will test
for metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's my hurdle there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hurdle on the REI, that's a weird one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really weird one because the
fungicide and miticide products that I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned, the EPA registered are 24 hour,
but there are some elemental sulfur foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: spray sprays that are not through the EPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, they are not pesticides
because they're being used as nourishment,
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar nourishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's elemental sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant can use sulfur in its
metabolism, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some materials that don't,
don't qualify as pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, why is it they don't qualify as
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be all had to do with the inactive
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is in the pesticidal sulfur that
is not in the foliar feed sulfur?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the foliar feed sulfur actually
have lower REIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean that it's safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for whatever reason, the governing
body has determined the REI is,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, as short as two hours,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, still, you know, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not wait if you can, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's no, no law that says you have
to go in after two hours, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also the possibility that,
um, the research is done for the research
[SPEAKER_01]: was done to find that a combination of the
active and the inactive make it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably safer to go for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have that to say, I just have that,
that to throw out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what was another, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real quick, Saul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you had mentioned that one of the
things that's really important to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: is application, uh, frequency,
but also application rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your recommended rate based off of
what you've seen in facilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to make a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give you my experience,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: With, with a compact, with a, um,
with a product that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was about 80% elemental sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 20% inactive at the time I was using 20
grams per gallon and I was applying twice
[SPEAKER_01]: a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that was in compliance with the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was working for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When again, when I had a Russ,
it might pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now subsequent to that, that time,
like I said, growers have figured out to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce that all the way down to 10 grams
per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I think most growers are using
about 15 grams per gallon with an 80%
[SPEAKER_01]: elemental sulfur product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can translate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are others that have lower sulfur,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what was I going to say regarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: These sprays, it'll pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an appropriate time to say it right
there when we were, we're just talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for interrupting you.
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was key for me again, is my mantra
is the monitoring, having good scouts that
[SPEAKER_01]: can identify Russet might as early as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a scout who I would call her the
Russet whisperer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she could practically smell,
I swear she could smell where Russet might
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I get a text and she,
she'd say, Hey, um, I want you to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh no, you've, I know what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you're telling me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you've smelled them out and sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: She could look at, um, leaf color in very
young leaves and find Russet might
[SPEAKER_01]: infestations very early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a better chance of getting rid of
them faster when they when it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, you don't know when the
infestations are just starting because
[SPEAKER_01]: usually the effects, the symptoms of the
plant don't pop up until after you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: sizeable infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was, that showed me the
importance of monitoring and having good
[SPEAKER_01]: scouts that are trained to ID these,
these symptoms as early as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when we found it, it's like,
okay, all hands on deck track and trace,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we know it's in this clone and we
know that in this strain and we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: it came from clones from those moms over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing we're doing is going to
look at it, look for it in those moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second thing we're doing is any
crops that are worse, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: clone and, and, and propagated before this
particular crop and are farther ahead,
[SPEAKER_01]: including potentially even in flower are
probably might have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's focus on what just like they did
in COVID time track and trace,
[SPEAKER_01]: where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who did you talk to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who did you meet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who were you around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who subsequently before you ID that before
you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Diagnosed who also may have may have
spread it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you start really intense
scouting, identify the plants that have
[SPEAKER_01]: it, mark them, and then do a sulfur spray
because you want to come back within a few
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally kill was often within 24 hours,
percent of the population had been
[SPEAKER_01]: reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can, you need to continue to go
back and scout at those plants until
[SPEAKER_01]: you're sure you got a mom, because again,
you're not going to always get them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and you're not going to get,
you may not get the eggs with sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not kill the eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, usually in my experience,
again, this was way back when I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: grows had gotten better, but within two
weeks I was of sulfur sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in good shape with whatever
infestation I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's super key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, I want to mention something
that is important on the scouting side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and this is maybe this will help folks
because this is a recent story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a guy reach out to us that thought
he had a fertility issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started digging into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, basically what we found was this
problem was happening at his facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was also happening at his,
his, uh, partner's facility and they
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chances of that being a fertility
issue versus a pest or pathogen is less
[SPEAKER_00]: likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more likely that there's a pest
involved or a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, it turned out to either
be russets or broads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I'm waiting to get, um,
an image to really determine that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, one of the other clues that we
had was, is this across all of your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: evenly, or is it, is it in one place
specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what we found was,
oh, it's worse over in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they were, they were doing
living soil beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a chance that, you know,
the fertility was different across there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but most likely if you're treating all
your beds are the same and you have a,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call a hotspot, um, it's,
it's most likely a pest or pathogen issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we want to, we want to dig
into that a little further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see it just with, um,
you know, across multiple genetics or in
[SPEAKER_00]: one part of your room or in one room
versus all of your rooms, um, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading, uh, it's more, it's less likely
that it's fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to bring that up as some
clues for folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know how to identify russets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mites for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in, you know, uh, a future podcast,
hopefully we can do my presentation on
[SPEAKER_01]: signs and symptoms of common cannabis
pests, which includes a russet mite,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, signs and symptoms, but you
really do need to know how to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a method that I develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't develop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from a class, a pathology class
that makes scouting for russet,
[SPEAKER_01]: russet and broad mites a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's something that some of the
growers I've worked with have,
[SPEAKER_01]: have tried and they like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it fast for faster scouting,
but I'll go over that on maybe on the
[SPEAKER_01]: scouting, um, podcasts when you want to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, unless anybody wants to reach out,
I can, I can talk to them about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, but yeah, that is, that is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting about russet mite is,
um, you know, the, the, they don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not great movers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're little carrots with feet,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To them, for them to move from one plant
to another is, um, it's, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so you'll often find one plant that is
just loaded with them and the neighbors
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't have a few of them, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're because they're touching.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's, I've noticed that it's,
um, and then that spot does grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can grow fast, but that's often the
case where you find one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, at one key, I want to, I want to,
I'd like my observation for monitoring,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, russet mite is when you get into
flower, it, in my experience tends to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: those really lower flowers down,
you know, even sometimes down on the trunk
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant before I see them up above.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why that is, but you start,
I start to see the symptoms, particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the leaf curl, you know, the,
the taco or whatever you want to call it
[SPEAKER_01]: on the canoe, um, down there in those
little teeny flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so might not be a bad idea when you're
scouting through a flower, when you see
[SPEAKER_01]: those, to take a look for those symptoms
down there and might alert you to where it
[SPEAKER_01]: is and possibly that it's just starting.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry, a con that I forgot about sulfur
is most growers don't want to use it in
[SPEAKER_01]: flower and I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So making sure you come in clean into,
into fire with no sulfur is smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's critical and some growers will
use a sulfur spray right before they flip
[SPEAKER_01]: or right when they're done with their,
um, two weeks into before the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: primordia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, in fact, if somebody is going to just
use what we call calendar spraying that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be the one spray that I would
say, yeah, that's a smart move where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you're, you're giving it one last
shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, luckily now fall goes well,
hopefully some growers will help us do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a biocontrol agent, which is
attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: To use in flower, um, which, which is not
going to taint the flavor of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the, of the product, um, with gallon
drum and socks and talus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If russets get past you and veg,
maybe there's a non-spray solution in
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to mention one other clue
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason this one threw me was
because I hadn't seen a plant this far
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower with this bad of an
infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hadn't come across it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we had flower buds that were,
um, that looked awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they were displaying every sort
of what could look like a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the, the tacoing,
the discoloration and the leafs and
[SPEAKER_00]: necrosis, uh, premature browning of
pistols, uh, poor development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the fan leaves looked great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fertility on the fan leaves looked
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds looked terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a picture up recently on my
Instagram, um, of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people clued right in on russets,
uh, or broad mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sent it to Suzanne and she actually
was leaning towards broad mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, I have yet to get a positive
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could potentially be either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not have a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a lesson learned for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both locations now are getting,
are getting scopes and they're hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: going to send me a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm waiting on that, but yeah,
we, uh, we got them a recommendation for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sort of what we talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a way to address this moving
forward, but, um, yeah, it's a powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: lesson of why it is important to scout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can avoid getting that far into
flower and, you know, to a point where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can no longer deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're facing crop loss or
significant crop yield loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, in my opinion is the most dangerous
arthropod pests of cannabis being russet
[SPEAKER_01]: mites and the fact that you can't see
those with the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you have some experience,
it's, they're difficult to find with
[SPEAKER_01]: loops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why every cannabis growers
doesn't invest a hundred bucks on a
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope that can help you ID russet
mites and broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally, you can get them for a
hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, since we're doing video here and
I know not everyone could see it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have my, I have my dino light,
which unfortunately is significantly more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive than a hundred dollars nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I also bought this like cheapo Amazon,
uh, hooks up to my phone and takes photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and this works good enough to get,
uh, you know, to see hemp russet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as high of a quality image,
but yeah, you got one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the same one even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think, you know, and mine at
the time was like $30.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there really is no excuse for not
having something, some sort of microscope
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can, you can take images.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I like this little thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's obviously not the, you know,
Cadillac dino light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I recommend if you can afford it,
you know, there are some affordable dino
[SPEAKER_01]: lights too, that are probably better than
the $30 one that you and I have,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is more than sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and also train yourself because you
can see them with loops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I know how to, it's not tough if you
just train yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some strategies on how you can see
them better with loops too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I feel like we covered a lot
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to get you back on because
there's so much more around the insect
[SPEAKER_00]: world to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm really grateful for the
relationship that we have with bio B and
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to, you know, work with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we do sell insects to our
growers and we ship direct from insectory,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, directly from you guys to the grower,
um, which I think is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we, we can always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn to you guys or put growers that work
with us in touch with you as a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that sort of support, that extra
technical knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there's no extra cost to that
because that's part of that's literally
[SPEAKER_00]: your job, which is so wonderful to our
customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, our costs, your customers are our
customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, it's, that's just part of the
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may not be able to visit all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm based in California, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do make it up to the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I'm there at the, at the end of
the month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, although I'm there briefly in
Portland, um, but there are times when I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: up there more frequently and I can
actually do visits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and any of your customers in
California, obviously easier to visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already visited one of them in this at
long beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, this is fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you could probably tell I can talk
about this for hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, and then there's nothing
as satisfying really to me than giving
[SPEAKER_01]: advice to a grower, having a grower work
with me to integrate it into their program
[SPEAKER_01]: and then getting the report back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This solved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it validates that, you know,
I'm not just giving BS information out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the same way on the fertility side
when we're able to get growers off of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bottled nutrients or a multitude
of products and simplify it with soil
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, um, and save the money and
produce a high quality flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's why we do what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, well, we'll definitely catch up
again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super good for this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, thank you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
