[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm here with Charles with
Emeo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the questions I've been asked a
lot about the product root that's used for
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation is, can I use it in a cloner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you go ahead and answer that for us,
please?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the short answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, you can use root in a cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do want to, of course, make sure that
you are introducing root in a way that is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to give the microbes some time to
form the symbiotic relationship with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and really be introduced in a way
that sets them up for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do recommend dipping in root before
putting into the cloner, not adding root
[SPEAKER_01]: into the res.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some growers like to actually leave their
cuttings in root for a few minutes before
[SPEAKER_01]: putting them into the cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said before, I kind of really give
the microbes a chance to get involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: get that gel nice and coated on the end of
the cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the reason that people tend to
wonder about the introduction of root in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cloner is thinking that it's going to
wash away as soon as the cuttings are put
[SPEAKER_01]: into the cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, again, one way to just kind of
balance that out is to do the dip before
[SPEAKER_01]: putting them in and potentially leaving
the cuttings in a cup with roots for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple minutes before putting them in your
cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I assume cleaning the cloner
really well at the end of the cycle to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid any biofil buildup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always want to make sure you're doing
those sorts of best practices to clean the
[SPEAKER_01]: cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you're introducing beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: With root and you want to do that in a way
that's going to create the most benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: for your plant, but then to make sure
you're kind of doing a thorough clean in
[SPEAKER_01]: between runs so you don't have anything
hanging around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for growers that are using some sort
of product for sterilization like bleach,
[SPEAKER_00]: zero tall, hydrogen peroxide, base things,
how would you best incorporate something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Into using a product like root?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, I understand a lot of
growers want to make sure they're taking
[SPEAKER_01]: as many precautions as possible to reduce
pathogen risk in their cloning operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can absolutely use those
sterilization products in combination with
[SPEAKER_01]: root.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the key thing is that it's not a
direct combination, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those products, of course,
are designed to kill microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they will interfere with root if
you mix them directly together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using a sterilization
product, we would recommend having a water
[SPEAKER_01]: dip step between taking something out of
your cup of hydrogen peroxide and going
[SPEAKER_01]: into root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, before you make that transition,
you want to take it out of your cup of
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrogen peroxide or whatever
sterilization product you might be using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then put it into root.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not getting that sterilization
product directly into root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any tips or tricks regarding
mixing root?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we receive it and realize
it's going to be a powder, how do we best
[SPEAKER_00]: make it into a gel for utilizing with our
plants, with our cuttings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, Tad, we put the microbes
in powder form because that's the best way
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep them stable and avoid anything
damaging the microbial consortia in
[SPEAKER_01]: transit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, that means also waking the
microbes back up, mixing that powder with
[SPEAKER_01]: water to turn root into the gel that you
ultimately want to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple things I would recommend there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that if you notice any kind of
clumpiness in the powder when you open up
[SPEAKER_01]: the pouch, we would recommend seeing what
you can do to break up the chunks before
[SPEAKER_01]: you mix it in with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also mention that warmer water is
easier for that mixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to use hot water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really hot water, like boiling water,
will damage the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But warmer water will help the gel to
dissolve a little bit more easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actually finding that it looks
like the mixing process is a little easier
[SPEAKER_01]: if you pour the powder into the glass that
we include to kind of mix things up first
[SPEAKER_01]: and then add water to the fill to hear
line as opposed to filling up your glass
[SPEAKER_01]: jar and then adding the microbes to the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just one quick addition to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you will still see a little bit
of clumpiness when that gel is forming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even the bigger clumps will ultimately
get incorporated into the solution is what
[SPEAKER_01]: we see and what we hear from growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes just a little bit more time,
and you'll end up with that nice gel
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency that we expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just from my experience with compost
teas and microbes, I assume it's perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: OK to shake the glass jar pretty
vigorously to get good mixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, thorough shake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shake is definitely the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else you wanted to cover today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say again, I appreciate the questions
that we've been getting around root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad that there's a lot of excitement
around microbial alternative for cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't hesitate to reach out to us
through case or through our Instagram as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at imio.co.
Thank you.
