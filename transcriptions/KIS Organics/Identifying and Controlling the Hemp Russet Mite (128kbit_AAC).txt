[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about the hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's another one that I've been
seeing a lot of with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty easy to identify, I think,
relative to other issues and other mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can you talk a little bit about it in
general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes and no, because again,
there's still a lot we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think there's a lot of bad
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not live in the vascular tissue of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not inserting their eggs into the
vascular tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's important to be getting good
information, but the problem is people,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first thing they do is they go to the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, there's a lot of bad
information on every subject out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are some of the biggest
misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You generally have done it to yourself
because you brought it in on plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material or possibly your clothes
clothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in enough cannabis facilities
that as you're walking down the aisle,
[SPEAKER_01]: your shoulders are brushing up against the
cannabis plants and you're just acting as
[SPEAKER_01]: a giant vector spreading the mites or even
insects down the rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be able to walk through a
facility without dragging your shoulders
[SPEAKER_01]: because even if you put on lab coat or a
Tyvax suit or anything, then you go out to
[SPEAKER_01]: the lobby, you take it off, you still
could have insects on your skin and you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be wearing a hairnet, but still,
you can spread things around that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the hemp russet mite is a
completely self-induced problem because of
[SPEAKER_01]: poor sanitation in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not getting hemp russet from the
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming plant-to-plant transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you are next door to a hemp field
that has it, it could theoretically blow
[SPEAKER_01]: in, but back to this whole the
government's releasing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the back of vans, driving down the
roads, it's all conspiracy theory stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other area phyids they're using for
weed management, it's not even close to
[SPEAKER_01]: the same species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to take responsibility that
they've done it to themselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's exactly what's happened with
the cannabis aphid because the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: aphid has now all been down the eastern
seaboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did it get here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Through plant movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't fly over here from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't ride over on grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't ride over on strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came on cannabis plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing with a hemp russet
mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor sanitation practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that when I'm consulting,
we probably spend 70, 75% of our time
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with just sanitation in production
facilities these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some good identifying
characteristics of hemp russet?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see it, again, you need super
high magnification.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically shaped like a carrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the broad mites are much more like
jelly bean kind of shaped, these are more
[SPEAKER_01]: shaped like a carrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the easiest ways to see it,
and they're kind of creamy colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have multiple stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it's just like spider mites
and just like broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they first hatch out, they're real
tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each time they molt, they just get a
little bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, if you see a carrot with a
couple hairs at the front end,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's her legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's just no mistaking it in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing that looks like that
so far that we've seen in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all this hemp going in outside,
who knows what we're going to see because
[SPEAKER_01]: we're starting to see all kinds of new
pests in the outdoor hemp production.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may end up eventually in some of the
indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for right now, again, July 11th,
2019, you see something that looks like a
[SPEAKER_01]: carrot, it's pretty much going to be a
hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless it's a lot bigger and is a ladybug
larva.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, a lot bigger and looks completely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I've seen that confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had thrips and russet mites confused
and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the hemp russet, what sort of
treatment options do we have once we
[SPEAKER_00]: spotted it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, again, smack yourself
in the back of the head for bringing it
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after you do that, there's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about this briefly before in
some of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had higher hopes, I think, for a lot of
the predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have a lot of confidence in the
predatory mites to manage it at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that Andersoni as a prevention
still has something there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you have a population,
again, spraying soap or oils, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: are your best options and you've got to
get really, really good spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what it comes down to is
good spray technique with good equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: not paint sprayers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray equipment designed for applying
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will the Suffolk X work as well?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there's been some work going on and
somebody else is doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to wait for him to put all that
stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Suffolk did really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his trials on the hemp russet mite
extremely well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know some of these have a life
cycle of a certain number of days or
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many applications or sprays do we need
to be doing to really control any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: insects we're talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's all about spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also with the eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, oils kill eggs better than soaps do,
typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always exceptions, but for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with eggs, since they respire,
it's so low, when you spray oil on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea is to suffocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a very low respiration
rate, it's hard to suffocate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know Cornell's done a lot of work
on, Dan Gill ran looking at oils and using
[SPEAKER_01]: them for two-spot spider mites eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said it works extremely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hemp russet mite eggs are so small and
transva-, not transva-, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: respirating very low, so they need
multiple applications of oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you've got to look at your
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to look at your, if your
plant's stressed, you got to be really
[SPEAKER_01]: careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you know, sulfur and oil,
bad, bad, bad, bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a fan of using sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: If sulfur will, if used properly,
you can really knock back hemp russet
[SPEAKER_01]: mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm concerned about all the sulfur being
used because of resistance issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you've kind of excluded yourself
from using beneficials at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I had one of my growers who was
using sulfur, and they tested positive for
[SPEAKER_01]: arsenic, and they went and they tested the
sulfur, and that seemed to be the source
[SPEAKER_01]: of arsenic was in the sulfur product they
were spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, jeez.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, remember, if it's being used
in, on tomatoes and things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not heavy metal accumulators,
so no one's ever had to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: testing that stuff before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying, you know, that all
sulfur has arsenic, don't, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in this particular situation, this is,
was, was their source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I'm just, I'm not gonna say I would
never recommend it, but I generally don't
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you're a lot safer for
resistance issues, because it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard to build resistance to oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cost wise, Suf Oil X, I think a two and a
half gallon jug is like 60 bucks,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you mix it up at like a 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're gonna make 250 gallons of
solution for $60.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the price is there, it's Omria
listed, so it's approved for use in
[SPEAKER_01]: organic production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying you can't use other oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just I've worked with this oil for
like 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a good comfort with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the, you know, basically
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I haven't had Fido.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's dry, we can re-release the
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you probably are gonna have to do a
few sprays back to back, because you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to get really good spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though you think you get 100%
spray coverage, you're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why if you do it again,
you know, you're gonna get more coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, you know, you paint a wall
a different color, and you think you got
[SPEAKER_01]: it, and the next day and you go by,
you see spots that are really thin where
[SPEAKER_01]: the paint wasn't thick enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why going back and putting a
second coat on will make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking like the next day or
waiting?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'd give it a couple days in between,
because you don't wanna just coat your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in oil either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about bringing a plant into the
facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you had a plant that you're
bringing in, you're like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could have hemp russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it could have any of the other pests we
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be your sort of procedure for
treating, you know, dunking clones or
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning up whatever it is you're bringing
in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, oh, you need to have a quarantine
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even seen new facilities being built
that don't have quarantine areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growing areas aren't isolated enough,
so problems just get spread around.
[SPEAKER_01]: With dipping of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you never, any kind of oil product
you do not want to dip the roots in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the oils are better for the
foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, my cat's just jumping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, blumpers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He coming for his afternoon pets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never wanna dip roots in oils,
and you never wanna drench with oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use products like the microbials
are safe for roots, the Bavarias,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Isarias and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember, those really don't treat for
mites, especially hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up in Canada, they've done a lot of
research with dipping cuttings for mums
[SPEAKER_01]: and for poinsettias and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in their research in Canada,
they found that dipping in a 0.1% oil
[SPEAKER_01]: solution of foliage, not the roots,
was a very good dip rate for dipping these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way you do get 100% coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why when people often take
cuttings are doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still, and I mean, this has been
going on for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still this, they're trying to get
it actually on the label to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's technically not on the label
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the research shows it works very well
for a lot of key pests, and it has a very
[SPEAKER_01]: good level of plant safety, and you get
100% coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of people are like,
well, we can just stick them and spray
[SPEAKER_01]: them, but then you're not necessarily
gonna get 100% spray coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a tricky situation there,
and we're waiting for this official dip
[SPEAKER_01]: label.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis isn't on the label either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because of the laws with the EPA and
things around pesticides, you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend a dip rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk about the research that
exists in Canada, but you can't make that
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation because of the rules and
regulations around, and SufoilX can't make
[SPEAKER_00]: that recommendation either.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to clarify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's why there's all this dancing
around about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But according to research, a very good dip
rate is 0.1% for Sufoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people ask me about dip rates for
other products and that's, you've gotta,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is what's good about the Sufoil
product, is they've got research to back
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been trialed, it's been tested,
and I see a lot of claims from products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And okay, you make this claim,
you say your product annihilates hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: russet mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's a single trial?
[SPEAKER_01]: It annihilates spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's something a university could
have done, or a third party or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is any research on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's tough to know what to believe and
what not to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I said that was the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is blimpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have blimpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an easy one for you, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in the sense that I think I know what
you're already gonna say, because we've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about it, but plant parasitic
nematodes, like the root knot nematode.
[SPEAKER_00]: What options do we have there with that
one?
None.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flame flowers, burn them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my same thing again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they're not flying in, they're not
walking in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought them into your facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you are in the South, because the
Southeast United States has a lot of root
[SPEAKER_01]: knot nematode and you're growing your
plants outdoors in the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, that's not your fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get it in an indoor grow or
in raised beds, you brought it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had somebody recently contact me and
they literally went outside and they just
[SPEAKER_01]: were scooping up soil outside to inoculate
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a total crap shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could bring in some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can bring in a lot of bad stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the risk you take with doing
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the University of Florida is putting
in 12 hemp trial sites this year down,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously in Florida, under various soil
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's gonna be very interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually do have one of their
nematologists working with them on this to
[SPEAKER_01]: see what nematodes are picked up and what
becomes a problem for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they've got this really weird
situation where they're not gonna be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to publish their findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of it being hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not allowed to talk about any of
the work they're doing at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that I'm hoping will give us more
information on, sorry blimps, on what,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we don't even know all the
nematodes that cannabis can get at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep getting reports of stem nematodes,
which I did have a grower that had some
[SPEAKER_01]: samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was so excited because one of the
nematologists agreed to look at them to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify them and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I asked the grower to ship them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the grower just went dark and
wouldn't respond to my phone calls or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called over and over and over again,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: They decided they didn't wanna be involved
with that, which I can kind of understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, until we can figure
out what we're really dealing with,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna be harder to manage the pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably get you some root knot
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, these were stem nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not looking for root knot.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we got plenty root knots around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a couple of questions I did have
around the root knot nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for people who are less familiar
with it, I wanna mention that when I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen it, the plant just literally just
seems to stop growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you pull up the plant,
you get these galls or knots in the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They almost look like rhizomes that you
would see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots on the knot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not knotted roots, root knot
nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's not cannabis specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big problem on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think carrots get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why people sell methyl bromide
soils to kill these plant parasitic
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes because they are so,
so hard to kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why in states, again,
like Florida, if you're gonna ship outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the state container as plant material,
you have to grow up on tables off the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground to prevent nematodes from getting
splashed into your pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where there's an actual measured
height that they grow at because water
[SPEAKER_01]: splashing can spread plant parasitic
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing that my friend tried was
heating the room for an indoor facility to
[SPEAKER_00]: raise the temperature of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They held it at 130 degrees for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard the research says you have to
get up to 170, but if you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain the room at a higher temperature
for a period of time like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know thermophilic compost that kills off
a lot of the pathogenic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, is that your air temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the temperature in the middle of
your soil bed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this case, I'm sure it was air
temperature, but... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you know it's not even close to
that inside of the soil in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not... And people ask me about
heating room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't bring the root knot nematode in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're getting compost, I think you
should test your compost for plant
[SPEAKER_01]: parasitic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that most universities
or in the States, you can just send a
[SPEAKER_01]: little baggie in and have them do a test
because to me, it's not worth the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one speculation they had too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have... My friend has a space that
does have the root knot nematode,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it did have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried cleaning the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried all these different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were never able to remove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they have been able to do is sort
of knock the population down to where they
[SPEAKER_00]: can make it two to three cycles before it
gets really bad again, sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've had a little bit of success and
they do bring in quite a bit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Steiner-Namey Feltier, which I probably
didn't pronounce correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was there any chance that those two
could be competing for some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological niche in the soil at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are they just two totally... Well,
and this is where people have taken
[SPEAKER_01]: liberties saying that the beneficial
nematodes will control plant parasitic
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to the woman that actually did
some of this work, and this was at like a
[SPEAKER_01]: nematology meeting like 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, what they found is in the
Petri dish, if you put... And I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember which beneficial nematode they
put in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure it was root knot,
is they just kind of slightly moved apart
[SPEAKER_01]: in the dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, nematodes don't travel far.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people took that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It controls it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it worked, you would see all the big
farms doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wouldn't be still using methyl
bromide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's all I can say is if
something works, people do it and you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see big farms doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me, BASF, they would love to be
selling nematodes for control of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: parasitic nematodes because they'd be
selling billions of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that worked, they'd be doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would love to follow up another
time and talk a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even get to like spider mites or
thrips or some of those other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know we can't cover that much in
a... I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us.
Thank you.
