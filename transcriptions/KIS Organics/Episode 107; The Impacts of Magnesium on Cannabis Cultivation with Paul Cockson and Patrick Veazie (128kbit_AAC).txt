[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_03]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_03]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: My guests this week are two awesome
cannabis researchers, Paul Coxton and
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick Veazey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul has been on the podcast before on
episode 59 talking about his paper on
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be sure to check out that episode if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just click on the learn tab, then podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also recently had them on together to
talk about their phosphorus research and
[SPEAKER_03]: they are back this week to talk about
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul has been working in the hemp world as
a researcher since 2018 and in plant
[SPEAKER_03]: science research since 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a background in horticulture,
agroecology, and floriculture from his
[SPEAKER_03]: time at NC State.
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, he is pursuing his PhD at the
University of Kentucky working with
[SPEAKER_03]: industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul's primary research focuses on
rhizosphere management and brings
[SPEAKER_03]: strengths in plant mineral fertility,
plant hormones and growth regulators,
[SPEAKER_03]: substrate research, general diagnostics,
and greenhouse and growth chamber
[SPEAKER_03]: expertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to a strong greenhouse
background, Paul is also literate in field
[SPEAKER_03]: level agronomic processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul's passion is for mentorship and
sharing the research process with
[SPEAKER_03]: undergraduate students.
[SPEAKER_03]: When not doing research, Paul and his dog
Groot can be found hiking in local,
[SPEAKER_03]: state, and national parks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick Veazey has been working in the
hemp world as a researcher since 2019 and
[SPEAKER_03]: as a plant science researcher since 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a background in horticulture and
floriculture from his time as an
[SPEAKER_03]: undergraduate researcher at NC State.
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, he is pursuing his Masters of
Science at North Carolina State and is
[SPEAKER_03]: focusing on greenhouse substrates for
cannabis and other floriculture crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick's primary research focuses on
plant mineral fertility, substrate
[SPEAKER_03]: research, and general diagnostics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was super excited to talk to them about
some of their latest published research on
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me again, I know you guys have been
on the show multiple times now,
[SPEAKER_03]: but can you just give a quick bio each of
you and what you're currently up to and
[SPEAKER_03]: then we'll dive into these papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul, you want to start us off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Paul Coxton.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm currently a PhD student at University
of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got involved pretty early on with Dr.
Brian Whipker at NC State doing hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: research, cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since then, it's kind of been a fun
wild ride of just exploring this avenue
[SPEAKER_02]: and that avenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of our work coming out of there
that Patrick, myself, and Dr. Whipker did
[SPEAKER_02]: was related to fertility and mineral
nutrition of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, I'm at University of Kentucky
and we're exploring germination and
[SPEAKER_02]: establishment with some industrial hemp,
so a little bit more of the grain and
[SPEAKER_02]: fiber side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you, Patrick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'm Patrick Veazey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a first-year master's student at NC
State working under Dr. Brian Whipker and
[SPEAKER_01]: worked under Paul as an undergrad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my research is focused on mineral
fertility of different crops, including
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm moving a little bit more into the
substrate realm of CBD, hemp, and other
[SPEAKER_01]: crops as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I appreciate you guys coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the main purpose of the show today was
to talk about this paper that you are both
[SPEAKER_03]: authors on that Patrick did a lot of the
research on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's entitled Magnesium's Impact on
Cannabis Sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it B-A-O-X?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the name of the cultivar?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how do you pronounce that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bayox.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bayox, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And suverhaze growth and cannabinoid
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we dive into that paper,
there was a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got an email from a listener that I
thought was interesting and I kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to talk to you guys about it and
just kind of expand on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the email, the gist of the email was,
why don't researchers partner with farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: or growers that know how to grow plants to
get, you know, really healthy,
[SPEAKER_03]: happy plants for these trials?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this was in relation,
Paul, to one of the papers you did and the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and the paper not looking quite so
hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you kind of explain just a little
bit more around that process?
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I'll just leave it with that and
take it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first off, I'm actually really
excited that people are commenting and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, challenging and giving feedback
because it's important in this industry
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're all communicating together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes that means asking those hard
questions or expressing some frustration
[SPEAKER_02]: in constructive ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess I'll kind of answer that
twofold.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first part is actually the very first
paper that we did on the survey with
[SPEAKER_02]: Hunter Landis, we partnered with a local
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was where we started with our
foundation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So given that Dr. Brian Whipker has an
extension appointment, we really do value
[SPEAKER_02]: and try and partner with growers whenever
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the challenge sometimes is,
especially with larger grants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're often required to partner with
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this industry, at least on the
scientific side, is so new and we're still
[SPEAKER_02]: breaking into it that a lot of those
federal funding and larger grants are just
[SPEAKER_02]: now starting to roll out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so most of us were having to do solo
work, trying to kind of figure some stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: out on a smaller scale, which sometimes
makes it difficult to involve growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely moving forward,
we're all in this together and we only get
[SPEAKER_02]: better together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, definitely partnerships are the
way to go because, you know, we're
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really good at science, but
sometimes, you know, we're still learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also, I want to touch on the fact
that the point of research is not just for
[SPEAKER_03]: research itself, but actually to further
knowledge for growers and farmers in the
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural sector so that we can grow
better plants, so we can better understand
[SPEAKER_03]: that process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not doing science in a vacuum,
but you're doing it hopefully with the
[SPEAKER_03]: goal of impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always laugh because Brian, Dr. Whitker,
he has a saying, he does a lot of nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency work and he always says his
motto is, we kill plants so you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think sometimes,
you know, we as scientists, we're almost
[SPEAKER_02]: looking to fail or we're looking for that
failure point because we're trying to fail
[SPEAKER_02]: and figure out, you know, what's wrong so
that we can inform the growers and the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry on what not to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing is just a little bit
about the scientific process itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you're designing an
experiment, you have a very specific
[SPEAKER_02]: question in mind and so you're kind of
streamlining all of your variables and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're trying to eliminate anything that
can impact that question so that you get
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a pure answer at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if something goes wrong in the
middle of an experiment, sometimes you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't fix it because if you do try and fix
it, you don't know if maybe what you did
[SPEAKER_02]: to try and fix an autocorrect your
trajectory impacted the results or if it
[SPEAKER_02]: was truly your experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, early on when we were
still kind of trying to dial in with the
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus work, our plants didn't look
too hot but we knew that we couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: correct that because we were very
specifically trying to study phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we came to this next round of
experiments that Patrick headed up with
[SPEAKER_02]: the magnesium work, we definitely changed
a few things here and there, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: with the fertility regime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really showed through in this
experiment that we also learned from our
[SPEAKER_02]: mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once you have your methodology in place
in your hypothesis, you really can't make
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of changes at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're kind of committed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that essentially what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and Patrick, you had something you
wanted to add to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did experience some magnesium
problems in Paul's study, but kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at that, we saw the problem and
while we couldn't correct it for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of what springboarded us into
this next project is that all of our work
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of built off what we had done and the
problems we had seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though once we were committed to
only playing around with the phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: rate in that first experiment,
we adjusted and it actually sprung board
[SPEAKER_01]: us into this completely other direction
for a new experiment to look at magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while problems do occur early on,
as we've gone through this line of
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments, the plants have looked better
because we've made these minor changes all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of document that with our
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate you guys explaining that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is great to hear that research is
partnering with growers and farmers,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's the main purpose of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One other aspect to that, though,
too, as as someone who works with a number
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis facilities, they're not really
set up to do research in a lot of ways
[SPEAKER_03]: because you can't set up a protocol that
you know won't give you the highest
[SPEAKER_03]: economic gain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't you can't set up an
experiment where you know you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: lose some plants or your plants are going
to yield lower because at the end of the
[SPEAKER_03]: day, your bottom line is what's keeping
you in business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where, you know, having another
location, working with researchers and
[SPEAKER_03]: giving input is really important because
you just can't do it in a working
[SPEAKER_03]: facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to add that to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's let's just dive into this this
magnesium paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick, do you want to go and just
explain a little bit of what the goals of
[SPEAKER_03]: the paper were and start taking us through
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this magnesium paper really started off
as a problem that we were seeing with our
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and a lot of other growers in the
southeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magnesium, you can get a lot of it from
your water supply if you're on a well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where your groundwater contains a lot of
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty common in the upper
Midwest, where a lot of their parent
[SPEAKER_01]: materials contain the magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it winds up in their water.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, here in the southeast,
especially in North and South Carolina,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were seeing a lot of magnesium problems
because our water really doesn't contain
[SPEAKER_01]: any.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like with Paul's research, when we're
mixing our fertilizers, if you use triple
[SPEAKER_01]: tin, it doesn't contain magnesium and
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving along into that, we saw a lot of
growers had this magnesium deficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: going on, especially late in the bud set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to determine if we can find
that magnesium fertility rate that growers
[SPEAKER_01]: can target in order to not have that
magnesium deficiency, especially later in
[SPEAKER_01]: the production cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving along with that, we set up this
experiment where we looked at six
[SPEAKER_01]: different magnesium fertility rates of
zero
[SPEAKER_01]: zero, 12 and a half, 25, 50, 75,
and a hundred part per million magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we held them constant throughout the
entire experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at the uptake and the plant
growth at three different stages of
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative stage, pre flower, where we're
only a couple of weeks in a bud set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end of flowering of so 12
weeks of total growth or eight weeks of
[SPEAKER_01]: reproductive and just looked at,
you know, how much magnesium was the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: taking up and what the impacts on the
growth and cannabinoids were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of the baseline for the
study and why we did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you guys, what was your, what was your
media for this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I, when I think of magnesium,
I typically see it coming in a lot with
[SPEAKER_03]: compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's part of my media already in many
cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tend to never have to add magnesium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it's not in my water,
just cause we get it when we mix soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're growing, you know,
purely using mineral salts, I could see
[SPEAKER_03]: where that could be a little more
challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you guys doing in this case?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this one, we utilize the 70,
30 Pete per light volume to volume
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and we custom blended that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know it didn't have a pre-plant
charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this rate that we're sort of
recommending as a base line or cornerstone
[SPEAKER_01]: to modify from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is with nothing coming into the soil
as well as everything is supplied through
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you're saying, a lot of it can
come in with your substrate, your water or
[SPEAKER_01]: many other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's just what we were looking to
recommend is what should your cornerstone
[SPEAKER_01]: be to kind of look at to avoid the
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, if it is coming in a
lot in your substrate or in your water,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can kind of take that away from the
rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your decision to keep magnesium the
same throughout the cycle in terms of how
[SPEAKER_03]: much you were feeding, what went into that
sort of that conversation?
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking to keep it constant versus
altering it, it's mainly that magnesium's
[SPEAKER_01]: a mobile element.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the plant needs it, it'll be able to
translocate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to see just by giving a
constant feed, you know, will the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: take it from the lower leaves whenever
it's not in reproductive and move it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the new and developing foliage or into the
buds when it's developing?
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't really want to alter it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to kind of see if you held it
exactly constant throughout how the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's new sinks and sources were really
going to influence how much was needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, now, before we go into the results,
can you could one of you guys give me a
[SPEAKER_03]: little overview on magnesium?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like maybe we should we should have
backed up and started there in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: how how it works in the plant and what a
deficiency may look like relative to other
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients and if there's any antagonistic
relationships with other nutrients like on
[SPEAKER_03]: the Mulder's chart, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magnesium deficiency which we have a
pretty good photo of in the article,
[SPEAKER_01]: it initially will appear on that lower one
third of the plant, the oldest leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll start as this interveinal
full interveinal chlorosis and it starts
[SPEAKER_01]: right in the center of the leaf and kind
of spreads outward to the edge of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaflet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the deficiency becomes more
severe, it spreads into that middle
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of the plant and then we saw in
many severe cases it can be throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, once that interveinal chlorosis has
really developed, we begin to start to see
[SPEAKER_01]: necrosis forming and then leaves dying and
falling from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is also mobile in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once it starts in that lower one third
of the plant, the plant's actually taking
[SPEAKER_01]: the new the magnesium that was in those
lower leaves and translocating it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: upper portions of the plant to meet the
new development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially when we put that plant to
flower and reproductive, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take all those nutrients that are stored
in the bottom and it's going to shift them
[SPEAKER_01]: up to the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of essentially a magnesium
piggy bank in that lower one third of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant where it's going to kind of hold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once it's needed for that bud
production, it's going to move it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: upper portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of one thing we wanted to
look at is how much is needed to not see
[SPEAKER_01]: that translocation and keep it constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just because your lower leaves are
deficient, that doesn't mean your upper
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves are deficient because it's moving
it throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it will initially appear
first in the lower area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in terms of antagonistic effects
with other elements, magnesium is
[SPEAKER_01]: antagonized by potassium and calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's synergistic or we see an
increase in uptake when phosphorus is high
[SPEAKER_01]: or nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really looking at your N and P to see
if we really increase that nitrogen rate
[SPEAKER_01]: or you really increase that phosphorus
rate, you will see an increase in that
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for what we looked at here,
we had 150 part per million in constant
[SPEAKER_01]: feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we did increase this 250 part per
million to 300 part per million,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we have seen some growers do,
you may need to alter the rate that we do
[SPEAKER_01]: provide because when you increase those
two elements, you're going to see an
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in magnesium uptake as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just jump in here real quick and
provide a few comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the figures that we have in this paper
that Patrick was referring to,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's figure three and figure four for
kind of the initial deficiency stages for
[SPEAKER_02]: magnesium and then kind of the advanced
with figure four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another figure I'd like to highlight
is figure six, where we're looking at 25
[SPEAKER_02]: part per million magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a composite photo with both nioxin
and severe haze showing kind of that
[SPEAKER_02]: reallocation that Patrick was just talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially it's pulling it out of
those older leaves and funneling it into
[SPEAKER_02]: the new reproductive sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as Patrick said, phosphorus,
magnesium is synergistic with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you actually look at the fertility
rates that we utilized, we had 30 parts
[SPEAKER_02]: per million phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you'll kind of cast your mind back
to the previous episode that we had where
[SPEAKER_02]: we were kind of recommending start at
around the 15 parts per million rate,
[SPEAKER_02]: given we were going so high with the
magnesium and given that initially on the
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus study, we saw some magnesium
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what sparked the interest
that Patrick had in the study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we increased that phosphorus because of
the synergism with the magnesium,
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing that we would probably have an
effect there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the importance of magnesium
in plants, so in the chlorophyll molecule,
[SPEAKER_02]: it kind of sits in the middle of this
ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's important in chlorophyll
production and chlorophyll health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's directly correlated to
photosynthetic health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all know that the healthier the
photosynthetic machinery, the more
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthates and the healthier your
plant will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more resources it will have to
funnel into those buds or those seeds come
[SPEAKER_02]: the induction of a critical photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So magnesium is definitely an extremely
important element, given its role in
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate you guys explaining
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we dive in now to sort of what your
findings were on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll link to this paper and these
diagrams or figures on the podcast page
[SPEAKER_03]: itself so people can go back and look at
these as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our findings for this study was we
noticed that it was slightly different for
[SPEAKER_01]: both cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, Bayox, we didn't see some of the
magnesium deficiency at some of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: rates that we did for saviar haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually saw more of an impact on
saviar haze plants compared to Bayox when
[SPEAKER_01]: we had that low magnesium fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saviar haze is a bit more of a bushy
grower and a lot more aggressive grower
[SPEAKER_01]: than Bayox.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did notice is that there's a
big cultivar dependency here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to make this rate
recommendation of 50 to 75 part per
[SPEAKER_01]: million mg.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, one of our big things that we do
want to highlight as a takeaway is that
[SPEAKER_01]: this can kind of serve as a cornerstone
for a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it is not exactly the recipe for
a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we can say it's in this range,
one of the big things I do want to
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight before getting too deep into
this is that this will vary based upon
[SPEAKER_01]: what cultivar you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a very aggressive grower,
you may need to look at a slightly higher
[SPEAKER_01]: rate compared to a smaller plant or if
you're keeping them smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, magnesium had a negative
impact on plant growth at the lowest two
[SPEAKER_01]: rates of zero and 12 and a half part per
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're seeing in the plant
being deficient in the magnesium uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of once we start to move up the
ladder, 25 to 50, it was also very
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent upon what stage in growth we
were at.
[SPEAKER_01]: At four weeks of growth, 25 and 50 for
Bayox were fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, as we begin to move into the
later weeks, we begin to see that
[SPEAKER_01]: difference grow much more in terms of
overall plant growth metrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So later into the production cycle and
that plant needed more magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really turned into 50 to 75 produce
better growing plants and more yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing to really highlight is that
we looked at this range of rates of six of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, at the lower rates of zero to 12 and
a half, we completely expected to see a
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease in plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the other things I want to
highlight is when we go to the far end of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you supply a plant with too many
nutrients, you will actually decrease your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we really saw that for both
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting even initially at eight weeks of
plant growth for Bayox, plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: received 100 part per million phosphorus
showed significantly less growth compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to those that received 50 to 75.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw the same yield as plants that
received zero part per million magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really finding that key balance
for a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to oversupply your plants
with magnesium, but you definitely don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to undersupply them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where we give these
rates as the cornerstone of 50 to 75 part
[SPEAKER_01]: per million mg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really looking at the final growth
stage, we saw that there wasn't a real big
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in bud weight overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for Bayox, there was no differences at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at magnesium,
plants that received zero or 100 part per
[SPEAKER_01]: million mg exhibited significantly less
bud weight overall compared to plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: were in that 50 to 75 part per million mg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your magnesium rate can directly impact
your yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you're not seeing magnesium
deficiency, you will see a decrease in bud
[SPEAKER_01]: production because of an over accumulation
of magnesium in your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the really big things we
want to highlight from the plant growth
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one of the main ways that a grower
can determine magnesium concentration in a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is through leaf tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things we saw is that as
you begin to give the plant more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium, it's definitely going to take
that magnesium up looking at all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: different nutrient analysis that we did on
both cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both cultivars up took magnesium in a
linear fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more you gave it, the more it took
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, granted, we also saw that decrease in
bud production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of one of the key things to
highlight is that a greater magnesium
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration does not mean better,
healthier plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of looking at a sweet spot here
of about 1.15 to 1.3 percent magnesium in
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of that 50 to 75 part per
million what it turns into concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't see an actual plateau.
[SPEAKER_01]: That linear increase can continue all the
way up to 100 ppm in G.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe if we increase the rate further
to 150 to 200 part per million magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: we may see an actual plateau occur where
the plant just won't take any more up.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, up to 100 ppm in G, which is not
hard to obtain, we did see an overall
[SPEAKER_01]: plateau or we did not see a plateau in
uptake, but we see a plateau in growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at those, if you do conduct
nutrient analysis, making sure you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: those values and understand that more is
not better is a key thing to kind of take
[SPEAKER_01]: away from this piece of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could add something real quick to
that, just one clarification.
[SPEAKER_02]: For Bayox, regardless of the magnesium
concentration, we didn't see much
[SPEAKER_02]: differences in the bud weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for severe haze, we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those differences were seen at the 50
parts per million rate compared to the
[SPEAKER_02]: zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then once we got up to those higher
concentrations, like Patrick said,
[SPEAKER_02]: we did see a decrease.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that total bud weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, just kind of to kind of,
I guess, parrot something that Patrick
[SPEAKER_02]: said earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really, when looking at this research
and trying to figure out what does this
[SPEAKER_02]: mean for my operation, what does this mean
for me, recognizing that there will be
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar to cultivar, variety to variety
differences that you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so using this as kind of a starting
point and a guideline to conduct your own
[SPEAKER_02]: research in your own facility,
because a lot of other abiotic factors,
[SPEAKER_02]: what type of lights you're using,
how often you're irrigating your vapor
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure deficit will impact how those
plants are taking up and utilizing the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just wanted to reiterate what Patrick
had said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just so I understand it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said that with Bayox, you didn't see a
difference in bud weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when you got to the higher
concentrations, you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did you or did you not see a difference
in overall yield, I guess?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you talking about the actual bud
size and weight just comparing like a
[SPEAKER_03]: single bud?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my confusion in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at table 10 and table 11
from the paper, you can see the total bud
[SPEAKER_02]: weight there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took a subsample composite,
if I'm remembering correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all of the buds on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking at table 10, which is Bayox,
for any of the examined magnesium
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility rates, we don't see a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, sauvier haze, we do see a
difference between that 50 or we see a
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease in total bud weight produced by
those that were zero part per million mg
[SPEAKER_01]: and 50 in total.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also see a decrease on the
other end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants that received 100 part per
million mg produced significantly less
[SPEAKER_01]: total bud weight compared to those that
received 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really ties in that cultivar
difference between cultivars will react
[SPEAKER_01]: differently based upon the magnesium
fertility rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some, you may see a significant
decrease in bud production in others,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to kind of summarize, Tad, in one
cultivar, we saw no differences regardless
[SPEAKER_02]: of which magnesium rate we were seeing in
total bud weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no correlation between bud weight and
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in the other cultivar,
we saw that we had lower bud weights at
[SPEAKER_02]: those lower concentrations and it
increased up to that 50 parts per million
mg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it then decreased when we got to
that 100 to be less.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the big takeaway is that genetics can
play a huge role in magnesium uptake
[SPEAKER_03]: because we have such diversity in genetics
and what people are growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the other, I guess, big points
that you would highlight are, sorry,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to go back now and recollect my
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'm going to come back to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the thing I want to touch on was
lighting because you mentioned lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were growing in a greenhouse in this
case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you mentioned magnesium's role in
photosynthetic activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think if you had pushed your PBFD
levels higher or more consistently across,
[SPEAKER_03]: like say with an indoor facility,
you know, at 1200 PPFD or somewhere around
[SPEAKER_03]: there, you would have seen increased
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess you couldn't see increased
magnesium uptake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think you would have seen
deficiencies or maybe have needed more
[SPEAKER_03]: magnesium in those instances relative to
what you actually saw in this study?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think by pushing the plant by
increasing, you know, PPFD, once you're
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing that plant to get bigger,
faster, comparatively to, we were growing
[SPEAKER_01]: with natural DLI with night interruption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this started off in early spring and
transitioned into later in the spring,
[SPEAKER_01]: closer to mid April.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we weren't in, you know, what we
consider the maximum PPFD or DLI for the
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by adding more lights and other things,
and you're really pushing that plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing the photosynthesis, increasing
mass flow of other nutrients, I think you
[SPEAKER_01]: would have needed a slightly increased
magnesium fertility rate to help
[SPEAKER_01]: compensate for that plant growth that
you're really pushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, when you're really,
if you're increasing the photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_01]: and transpiration and everything else,
magnesium is going to get drawn up more
[SPEAKER_01]: because the plant's utilizing more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could potentially need to increase
your magnesium fertility rate as well to
[SPEAKER_01]: compensate for that increase in plant
growth or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to try and slow the plants
down and not need to irrigate nearly as
[SPEAKER_01]: much between intervals, then you could
potentially lower this magnesium fertility
[SPEAKER_01]: rate as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely lighting if you're going to
push the plants, potentially looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: tinkering with this cornerstone that we're
kind of providing, you may need to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase it depending upon your setup as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And did you see calcium or potassium
deficiencies as you increased magnesium up
[SPEAKER_03]: to that 100 ppm level visually with the
plant or with tissue analysis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Paul did the original cornerstone that
you all highlighted of nutrient values for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were only playing around with about
100 ppm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really didn't see that much of a
difference compared to our 150 ppm in
[SPEAKER_01]: modified Hogan solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if we really would have started to
increase the magnesium, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 150, 200, we could have started to see a
little bit more of that interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do slightly see some of that
interaction playing out in sauvier haze,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't see nearly two deficient
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is just a little bit of that
interaction occurring where you see as we
[SPEAKER_01]: go up in magnesium, you see slightly lower
calcium levels in some of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the high level thing, just getting back
to that are that it's really important to
[SPEAKER_03]: have sufficiency in magnesium,
but you can't have a luxury amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has antagonistic effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a limit to how much magnesium
you want in your media or being uptaken by
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be affected by all your
abiotic conditions, your environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: watering habits, all of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mobile nutrient and genetics plays
a big role.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any other high level things that
I missed and kind of recapping some of
[SPEAKER_03]: this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And 50 to 75 ppm was the sweet spot in
this study for these genetics based off
[SPEAKER_03]: what you saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other high level thing that we kind of
wanted to point out is we didn't see any
[SPEAKER_01]: influence on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from our current understanding is at
these levels, we weren't seeing that
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction with the cannabinoid
production pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially, if you are running a
different system or running different
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics as well, you may start to see a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we did not see a difference based
upon the magnesium rate for our setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, go ahead, Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll kind of jump in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at tables 14 and 15 from
the paper, it kind of highlights what
[SPEAKER_02]: Patrick was saying here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we essentially did is we kind of
reiterated this point that genetics plays
[SPEAKER_02]: a huge part because you can see that while
magnesium didn't necessarily impact the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, we did have quite stark
differences between the two cultivars and
[SPEAKER_02]: the type of cannabinoids that they were
producing across the acidic pools as well
[SPEAKER_02]: as the decarboxylated pools.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, just kind of driving home the
point that this is a starting point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on your genetics and your
environment, you can kind of use this as a
[SPEAKER_02]: guiding star, but you'll have to make some
fine tune adjustments and find out what
[SPEAKER_02]: works for you and your operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as someone who works with what people
are calling living soil these days,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is essentially soilless media with
compost, organic inputs, where the
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients or fertilizer that we're adding
is not immediately available to the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: like it is in the study that you're
running.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tend to aim for lower levels of
magnesium on my soil tests because I know
[SPEAKER_03]: that it can tighten the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It raises your pH pretty dramatically
relative to other cations, and it's harder
[SPEAKER_03]: to flush out relatively relative to some
of the other cations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, I aim low.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as an organic grower,
I use magnesium sulfate Epsom salt as a
[SPEAKER_03]: way of sort of feeding magnesium as
needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But typically I'll wait until I get a,
you know, some sort of visual clue of a
[SPEAKER_03]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one thing that your research is
showing, and correct me on anything I've
[SPEAKER_03]: said so far, if I misspeak in your eyes,
you're saying that potentially just by
[SPEAKER_03]: waiting for that visual deficiency on
magnesium, I may be possibly impacting
[SPEAKER_03]: overall plant health or yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you found differences based off of
doing your leaf tissue analysis that
[SPEAKER_03]: showed essentially a decrease in yield
prior to visual plant deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a fair assumption?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that you're saying with, in a living
soil system, magnesium can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic, both with pH locking up the
soil and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're also kind of holding it there
to kind of, it's already incorporated into
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what we're kind of viewing is we did
see decreases when we didn't add any
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement because we did a constant feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't answer that if you're making an
adjustment as you see a visual deficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're negating the deficiency with
your supplement of Epsom salt,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're kind of only saying that if you see
the deficiency and you don't supplement,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will see a decrease for the two
cultivars we looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can't necessarily make a statement
if you see the deficiency and you make an
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustment, the leaves will still look
deficient, but that new growth is likely
[SPEAKER_01]: going to take it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I assume you're negating it to a
certain point, but I can't necessarily say
[SPEAKER_01]: that you are going to see that deficiency
if you add later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a mobile nutrient,
those lower leaves are potentially
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient sinks at that point, especially
in an indoor facility where they're
[SPEAKER_03]: getting a lot less light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're saying it may not be as
impactful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's not going to go back and
prioritize those lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you add Epsom salts, those leaves
will still look deficient and show the
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the additional magnesium sulfate you
applied will be prioritized to your new
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, which would be your bud or your
new developing shoot tip, which is your
[SPEAKER_01]: economic portion of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll jump in real quick if I can here and
kind of highlight something that this
[SPEAKER_02]: paper shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of going back to the figure that
I referenced before, where we had the two
[SPEAKER_02]: mature plants at 25 parts per million
magnesium that were showing those
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important when you see a
nutrient deficiency, a lot of times you
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to freak out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, oh no, something
doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_02]: My plant isn't totally beautiful and it
doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, understanding the life cycle of the
plant and when that deficiency may start
[SPEAKER_02]: naturally occurring because of that
reallocation can also kind of help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're within the sweet spot
for your operation, you've done your
[SPEAKER_02]: research and you've looked at your 50
parts per million.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know that with your genetics and
your setup, you're going to see some
[SPEAKER_02]: magnesium deficiency about four weeks in
to your new bud set, it may be okay
[SPEAKER_02]: because that plant is just reallocating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're trying to correct that at
that point, you may be throwing money away
[SPEAKER_02]: because if you know that the final product
you're getting, even though you're seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: that magnesium deficiency in those leaves,
because it's relocating, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: put more money into the system when you
know that your cannabinoids and your bud
[SPEAKER_02]: is still going to be good at the end of
the season there for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's kind of like the
classic, you're driving by a cornfield in
[SPEAKER_02]: the fall and the plants look like crap
because they're dying and senescing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's actually a good thing because
the plant has taken up all these resources
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's reallocating it to the sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you actually want to see, you know,
that reallocation because it means that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've actually done your job,
you've dialed in your precise nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're reallocating what you've
already given to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good point that you both
brought up and Patrick, especially I want
[SPEAKER_03]: to highlight something you said for folks
and that's that it's important to know if
[SPEAKER_03]: a nutrient is mobile or immobile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if a nutrient is mobile, then we're
really focused on that new growth,
[SPEAKER_03]: the upper the upper portion of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only are those leaves down at the
bottom not ever going to look good again,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't mean that we're
necessarily going to impact our overall
[SPEAKER_03]: plant health or the economic value of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something we take for granted
because people do, you know, like like you
[SPEAKER_03]: said, Paul, people freak out when their
plant starts to show any issues at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so funny because I'll have people and
they'll be like, oh, my plants finished so
[SPEAKER_03]: well, they looked great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they send me the photos and I'm
like, oh, my gosh, like, how did this
[SPEAKER_03]: plant even survive?
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then other people are like,
oh, man, I had a terrible run.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they send me these plants and I'm
like, dude, you crushed it like these look
[SPEAKER_03]: great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I would have been very, very happy
with these results.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of it is subjective in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think that we can we do need to
look at mobile versus immobile nutrients
[SPEAKER_03]: and also just understand that that these
are living organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not designed to look like what you
see on social media all the time across
[SPEAKER_03]: your entire facility and all your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a that's a very good point to
make.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else did we want to talk about in
regards to magnesium?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys have other things to
highlight?
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably have a couple more questions,
but I wanted to just kind of open the
[SPEAKER_03]: floor here and see what your thoughts
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the big things is kind of
something we took away from this was
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure what your magnesium levels in
your soil are to start off with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've looked at a handful of commercial
substrates and some come in with a major
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-plant charge and very high magnesium
at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding what's coming in in your
substrate and then followed up by what's
[SPEAKER_01]: in your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on city water, this may not be a
concern for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on well water, this you may
already have a significant amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium in your water source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we start to play around with what
magnesium rate works for your operation,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of taking all of these factors
into effect and both looking at your
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate before you utilize that in your
operation, as well as water quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those impact a wide array of nutrients,
just not magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But magnesium is heavily impacted by those
two is kind of what we've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the most common nutrients
that come in in people's water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to add to that in the sense that
I think everyone should test their water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone should test their soil and don't
assume that the test that you receive from
[SPEAKER_03]: the municipal water company, from the
commercial soil producer is always
[SPEAKER_03]: accurate, especially because most of these
potting soils like ours use a fraction of
[SPEAKER_03]: compost and that compost as much as we
want it to be consistent, there's always
[SPEAKER_03]: room for variability and that can lead to
your overall potting soil having
[SPEAKER_03]: variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just something that people need to
be aware of and account for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interestingly enough, so I'm on a
municipal water system in this house that
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved into here in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I reached out to the water provider
and what they do is they source from a
[SPEAKER_03]: number of wells to get a more consistent
water supply.
[SPEAKER_03]: They only test for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I asked them, you know,
from a gardening perspective, like what
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of cations are coming in in my water,
they they said that those are all
[SPEAKER_03]: considered secondary elements in their
eyes or variables and they don't even test
[SPEAKER_03]: for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to send in my own test to find
out what levels of calcium and magnesium
[SPEAKER_03]: sodium were in my water, which is,
as you know, very important because we see
[SPEAKER_03]: we tend to see at least the water tests I
see the biggest issues I see are usually
[SPEAKER_03]: heavy metals and salinity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sodium, I haven't seen super high
magnesium water, but that's just,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, the areas of the country that
I've happened to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's it's absolutely a concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Paul, you're nodding your head to do
you want to add anything to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I'm just saying if you want to see
some high calcium and magnesium column,
[SPEAKER_02]: come on over to Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you some some test results with
that limestone base.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, you're absolutely spot on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that municipal water
facilities will often test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also it can vary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, here in Kentucky,
you're just based on where your water is
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the flow of the groundwater
itself, you can have variability over,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, weeks or months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you may dial in and then
test your water three months later and
[SPEAKER_02]: your calcium and your magnesium could be
completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that can vary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can impact your acidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, test early, test often.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for those of you that are in the
soil is potting soils or living soils,
[SPEAKER_03]: making your own soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tend to not even add a magnesium input.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't I don't like to necessarily
use dolomite lime.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't use Sopomeg, K-Meg, whatever you
call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you'll get a little bit of
magnesium from a lot of different organic
[SPEAKER_03]: soil amendments already.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just with the compost fraction,
you probably have some level of magnesium
[SPEAKER_03]: sufficiency just based on the number of
soil tests I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, since it's probably the easiest
organic supplement to add, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: since we do have access to magnesium
sulfate or Epsom salt, it's just it's
[SPEAKER_03]: soluble.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's just it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something that I feel like I can
always add to my soil, but it's much
[SPEAKER_03]: harder to subtract.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to throw that out as sort
of an overview for people that are like
[SPEAKER_03]: myself, you know, more on the organic
living soil side of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guys, I feel like we've really
covered magnesium quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have anything else to add on
magnesium or do you have any future
[SPEAKER_03]: research?
[SPEAKER_03]: That you're excited about right now that
you're working on or what are even just
[SPEAKER_03]: your future plans professionally for for
both of you guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick, you want to start us off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll lead into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hemp hemp work wise,
been playing around with some other
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient work, looking at micronutrient
uptake, looking at some amendments to
[SPEAKER_01]: soilless substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then playing around with some
different aggregates and looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the direction that I'm
playing around with right this moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been it's been very
interesting, hopefully looking to build
[SPEAKER_01]: off that more in 2023 and take that
research we've done and take it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it's just all been soilless media
and looking at different blends for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to move more into how to make
good soil a substrate and look at how to
[SPEAKER_01]: be more renewable with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the direction that I've been
heading for the 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I know Paul's been looking at a
lot of different hemp things as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, before we go over to Paul,
Patrick, if you ever want to look into
[SPEAKER_03]: living soils and reamending the soils and
treating them like an agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: commodity from a state of sustainability,
perspective, I think it's it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: exciting from a science perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really interesting,
but it's a little bit more challenging,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially on the IPM side.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I'm sure you guys know, I want to ask
you what substrates you're experimenting
[SPEAKER_03]: with right now, because from a
sustainability perspective, I would love
[SPEAKER_03]: to eventually move away from cocoa core
and peat moss as sort of the dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: media options in our industry,
at least on the organic side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, Rockwell is horrible
environmentally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've looked into a few different
media's option or substrate options,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I haven't found anything that will
perform anywhere near the levels of what I
[SPEAKER_03]: can get from from peat moss right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still using peat moss as my base.
[SPEAKER_01]: An individual you may want to look into
his research, Dr. Brian Jackson with NC
State.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done a lot of work with wood fiber,
so he's looking at using pine trees to
[SPEAKER_01]: completely replace peat and all the other
aggregates, and they have looked at a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of different peat blends and other wood
blends in order to try and dial that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has done some work with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul could probably make a little bit
better comment on his hemp work,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he does a lot of wood fibers and
alterations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've looked into that a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a bit stymied either on price or
on, I guess, growth metrics, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: given up hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's something there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I would love to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Down the road, I think you guys did an
introduction, so I need to follow up on
[SPEAKER_03]: those emails and see if I can keep
pestering him to get him on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you, Paul?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go into my future here in just a sec.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to make one comment that I think
part of the reason why Coca-Cola and peat
[SPEAKER_02]: have become a bit of an issue is kind of
the general theme in agriculture is we
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to find one thing that works,
and we tend to just use it, use it,
[SPEAKER_02]: use it, use it, and use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at true sustainability,
like a diversified network, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like a good investment portfolio.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have a diversified portfolio.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have a diverse product and
diverse products that you can build into
[SPEAKER_02]: the system, and that goes with pretty much
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fertilizers, substrates, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that really where a lot of the
future research is going to have value is
[SPEAKER_02]: finding those things that won't completely
replace something, but are going to help
[SPEAKER_02]: move us towards a diversified portfolio so
that we start alleviating stress and start
[SPEAKER_02]: moving these industries to be more of a
sustainable consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, moving more and more towards as
sustainable as we can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just wanted to add that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're saying even if we just added 20%
wood fiber to our substrate recipe,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to have a dramatic impact in
a beneficial way towards our overall
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainability, even if we're not
completely replacing Petercore?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a substrate specialist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let Jackson come on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let Jackson come on here and answer
that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, theoretically from a conceptual
thing, if you're even replacing just 20%,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's 20% more than you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: You scientists are so good about not
speaking out of your lane.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll never catch you on something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why Jackson has so much
value.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to get him on the broadcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's in the future for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you getting close to graduating?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so right now I'm slated to graduate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fall of 2024 or spring of 2025.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, in the research world,
nothing is ever a hardcore perfect set
[SPEAKER_02]: timeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have a bad year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have a crop failure,
especially when you're doing field level
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as for me, like I said,
focusing more on germination,
[SPEAKER_02]: establishment, rhizosphere metrics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, really what we're doing
heavily is looking at roots and trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: image those roots and figure out how root
phenotypes and how they're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: growing to help us with rhizosphere
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as what I want to do for the
future, I love research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always been insatiably curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love being able to take that
research and not just have it be some sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of data that sits there, but actually
turning it into a meaningful and
[SPEAKER_02]: applicable story for people and one that's
actually going to help the industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for my future, I don't know if that's
industry, I don't know if it's academia,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I know that definitely that outreach
with growers and with the industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically research and development
would definitely be an avenue that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: pursuing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the exciting thing about this crop,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the reason all of us
are here is because we feel like there's
[SPEAKER_03]: so much more to learn and we don't have
all the answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think corn would be really boring now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The research has been done.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on a new frontier here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's so exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and grain and fiber, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know that that's not your focus
necessarily here, Tad, but don't
[SPEAKER_02]: underestimate the value that those could
have as a launched commodity as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it would just add more research
dollars and more value to this industry in
[SPEAKER_02]: all of its avenues.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be an interesting topic because
I don't really know a lot about the fiber
[SPEAKER_03]: side of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just hasn't been a focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd be curious to know where what
opportunities exist in that industry as
[SPEAKER_03]: infrastructure for processing the fiber
grows as demand for the fiber grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that would be I think that
would be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's a future podcast topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we sign off, have you guys done any
work with biostimulants?
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking specifically at microbes and
their role in nutrient uptake in the
[SPEAKER_03]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something either of you have an
interest in or have done any research on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or see future research?
[SPEAKER_02]: So as as far as the work that was done at
NC State, there there we did not look into
[SPEAKER_02]: biostimulants or bio additives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was some research that a few a few
companies had expressed interest in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just, you know, sometimes the stars
don't align as far as the funding or
[SPEAKER_02]: follow through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's just it's definitely an
area that needs to be studied.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a wealth of knowledge out there
that shows just how much value these these
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial communities can have not only to
the plant, but also to the network,
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, the rhizosphere,
to nutrient cycling, nutrient availability
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that, you know, you live and
breathe TAD with you and your company and
[SPEAKER_02]: the excellent work that you guys do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But who knows, maybe a future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's the future of agriculture
in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we hit peak phosphorus, as we see
limitations in supplies, we need to figure
[SPEAKER_03]: out ways to better utilize the nutrients
and elements that are available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where I think, you know,
these microbes are so complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really daunting to try and study it
because they have a synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just isolate one and expect to
understand it fully.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a bit of a.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it kind of hurts my brain to think
about it or even begin to try and
[SPEAKER_03]: construct a reasonable research study
around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think there's something there,
even if we can't fully understand it at
[SPEAKER_03]: this point.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just want to thank both of you for
your time today, for sharing your
[SPEAKER_03]: research, for doing this research and the
impact it has and benefits for growers
[SPEAKER_03]: like myself that are always interested in
learning more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope we can stay in touch and
continue to to share this information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So growers can do a better job in their
gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having us.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We we all only get better together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the work you do to add on on the
podcast and everything, it really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really does make a difference.
