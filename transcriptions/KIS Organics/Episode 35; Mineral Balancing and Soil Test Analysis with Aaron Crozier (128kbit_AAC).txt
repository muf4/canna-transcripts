[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we talk a lot about soil testing
on this podcast and how important it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I wanted to get someone on the show
to have a discussion about how to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand and evaluate these soil tests,
because getting a soil test is one thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but understanding how to use that
information can be something else
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this week is Aaron Crozier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron is a soil and plant health
consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check him out on Instagram at
GROWRU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron is passionate about using soil and
sap testing to improve the quality of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron teaches growers how to re-mineralize
their soil and then work on increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron has been growing cannabis for over
two decades and working in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: almost as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last four years, Aaron has been
doing Soil Amendment Recommendation for
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation sites all across North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron is an organic grower and gardener
that transitioned to organic living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: after doing testing of different methods
in his personal garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is currently working on becoming a
certified crop advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want help with soil testing
analysis or calculating the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient levels based on your soil test,
we are working with Aaron to offer his
[SPEAKER_00]: services on our website at www.kisorganics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click on products and it's under the
garden equipment and testing category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can go to GROWRU.com to reach him
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have links to everything we discuss
as well as the soil test analysis and some
[SPEAKER_00]: sample tests on the podcast page if you
want to follow along with a soil test as
[SPEAKER_00]: we discuss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Aaron, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hey, I wanted to get started talking
a little bit about you and your background
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can give listeners an idea of how
you got into becoming a soil and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health consultant and evaluating these
soil tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've always been interested in
plants and nature and I have grown for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started experimenting with different
methods because basically I grew outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time ago and friends of mine knew,
you know, to use particular amendments and
[SPEAKER_01]: get really good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had shared with me some of their
tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then years later I became sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically that's when I started
growing cannabis indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a friend of mine, he's like,
hey, you got to do my method and set all
[SPEAKER_01]: this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really wanted to test and see what
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I set up a light and tested all the
different methods like Abinflow and DWC
[SPEAKER_01]: and soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd heard about bioponics and it was
like organic and synthetic combined with
[SPEAKER_01]: TOCO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seemed kind of interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tested it and it worked well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a guy who had a local
cable TV show and he did compost extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: and compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day he was at the hydro store and I
saw him there and said, hey, do you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to barter and teach me how to use the
microscope and do some testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see if I'm using GH or Purebland
and I combine it with some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial nocculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the nocculants even good?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens when you combine them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he agreed to teach me and this guy,
he didn't grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just, he had, you know, grew vegetables
and would do experiments with succession
[SPEAKER_01]: and he had bees and a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd make a compost pile of compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd bring it to his house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at it in the microscope and he'd
say, you know, throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I found a lot of the bag products,
you know, weren't very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in a lot of the testing,
I saw a lot of things would put the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes to sleep and they wouldn't,
they wouldn't do their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, Hey, Aaron, why,
why do you test all these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you just grow organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't have to test,
you know, what the harm is being done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, I haven't seen
anybody get the results, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he's like, just do it, you know,
try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I switched one light to soil and,
uh, I grew like a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanos from seed and to feed all those
evenly would have been kind of difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, the yield was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I switched over the rest of the
room to all soil and would do compost tea,
[SPEAKER_01]: compost extracts, basically rather than
teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, then I started seeing some
problems, um, where it wasn't performing
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's when I started getting
into soil testing because a lot of what I
[SPEAKER_01]: was being taught, um, from the guy from
using a microscope seemed like he had
[SPEAKER_01]: blinders on in some ways that,
Oh, all those things are going to do harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're no good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, and I asked, well,
have you tested it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in testing it, then it gave me and
getting the soil test of seeing what was
[SPEAKER_01]: going wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was very, very high potassium
and sodium and the calcium, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: was very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really led into what a lot of people
would say was, Oh, you need more cow bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question was always, well,
if you're growing organic, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you're not going to use cow mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I found not a lot of people knew
how to fix the problems when it came to
[SPEAKER_01]: organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just to, if your compost extract or
earthworm casting slurry doesn't fix it,
[SPEAKER_01]: then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what else you're supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw, Hey, you need more calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how that relates to all the other
canines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a few years later, uh,
there was a company who wanted to have
[SPEAKER_01]: testers for a, uh, this biological
advantage program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to, uh, a SAP analysis seminar
and they had speakers, John Kemp and
[SPEAKER_01]: Taneo, and they, they spoke about people
who had been doing testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been doing soil testing and fat
and how they learned a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deficiencies are really excesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really opened my eyes that,
uh, you know, when you're growing with
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro or conventional growing,
a lot of people overfeed and there's math
[SPEAKER_01]: you can use to, to make your own nutrient
plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same wasn't kind of being applied
to soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were making these really overloaded
soils and it was causing people problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw the same when I tried making a
soil mix and the plants weren't doing
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people, uh, then I started
figuring out why and then applying that to
[SPEAKER_01]: farms that I worked with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was doing consulting and I had ran
a, uh, 12,000 square foot indoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, warehouse and then I started working
with outdoor farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, a few years ago and spoke at
the Living Soil Symposium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that really brought in a lot
more, uh, soil testing work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then was able to see across the board,
you know, a lot of the problems that were
[SPEAKER_01]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're really known for is,
is soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of how I met you was
through, uh, Jaya Palmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He introduced me to you and said,
you should talk to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I know you've been working with
Build A Soil and a few other companies in
[SPEAKER_00]: doing soil testing analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can, can we talk a little bit about
sort of the history of soil balancing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is sort of where a lot of these
concepts and target levels come from,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then talk, we'll, we'll get into the
soil testing and the types of soil tests
[SPEAKER_00]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just a little background into maybe
William Albrecht and sort of where Steve
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon and a lot of these guys are basing
their beliefs on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, that's, that's, uh, I remember
reading hemp diseases and pests and in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, um, you know, it talks about
everything you do for, for healthy plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and in there he mentions, you know,
Albrecht and how it causes a stir of
[SPEAKER_01]: controversy in some circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically Albrecht was a guy who
studied, uh, soil and how it correlated to
[SPEAKER_01]: animal and human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did that for over 30 years all
around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he then would do testing and also
compare things like looking at if I wrote
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration ratios and the microbiology
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he found right down the center of the
United States where we had the grasslands
[SPEAKER_01]: and bison was, was like the ideal soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he determined some ratios from a
soil testing based on, uh, the total
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange capacity of soil and some base
saturations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, um, you know, when you,
when you search on Google, it'll give you
[SPEAKER_01]: some, some reviews that are kind of,
uh, mixed and.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've found was, um, in testing the
soil, a lot of the trace minerals weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where people were worried and
concerned that, uh, they were going to
[SPEAKER_01]: cause a lot of damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, because sulfates were
abused in the past and people over
[SPEAKER_01]: applying versus with this method of kind
of what they call soil balancing,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's application limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: For these minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we also think about how soil was
built in time, it's better to build it up
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly rather than just trying to hammer
it down with all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I want to mention for
listeners is this idea of soil balancing
[SPEAKER_00]: is, is really founded on the work of
Albrecht, which dates back to the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a new concept or new
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some target levels and sort of created
correlations between different minerals
[SPEAKER_00]: and trace elements that they believe grows
better plants or healthier plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it all falls into this sort of concept
of soil balancing, the idea of getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals at, at target levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to remind people that
these are our opinions that we're sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: in this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're based on our experiences and our
knowledge, but again, they are opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, I would say for these things other
than maybe what Albrecht or some of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, soil testing labs go off of,
but, uh, it really is, it really is based
[SPEAKER_00]: on opinions of people who have,
you know, agronomists or, or people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry who have had, uh, I guess good,
good reputations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you want to add to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other thing is when we consider
soil versus soil lift, too, a lot of this
[SPEAKER_01]: was done with soil where you're,
you know, sand, silt and clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is trying to create the right
physical home for the biology because the
[SPEAKER_01]: way calcium flocculates in soil and
magnesium tightens it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's where through Albrecht's
testing, he found, you know, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: problems are lack of mineral nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants don't have a pesticide deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a mineral problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why he has a saying,
you know, insects are nature's garbage
[SPEAKER_01]: collectors and diseases are the cleanup
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in finding, getting that balance that,
uh, and the minerals into the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that's going to make a plant that's
going to have higher health and quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in turn, greater pest and disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in time, it's not a, uh, it can take
time to happen because microbiology can
[SPEAKER_01]: take time to get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a big wheel that has a lot of
torque.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's slow to get going, but once it
gets rolling, it's, it's very powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about these,
these soil testing options in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: types of soil tests that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to just remind people that soil
a soil, perfect soil test is not our
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A perfect soil test is great, but at the
end of the day, let's keep in mind that
[SPEAKER_00]: these soil tests are not, they're not
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is going to be variability,
whether it's in the sampling or in lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lab, or, um, just in the abilities
of these tests to really properly measure
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the other thing I want to mention is
that if we are soil testing, we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay with the same lab because you can't
compare soil tests between two different
[SPEAKER_00]: labs, even if it's the same type of test
very effectively, because there's just too
[SPEAKER_00]: much variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, can you, can you talk to us about
some of the types of soil tests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I know a couple we're going to talk
about in more detail or the, the Malik
[SPEAKER_00]: three or standard soil tests from,
from Logan labs, as well as the saturated
[SPEAKER_00]: paste test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's excellent point is good for
people to remember that it's a tool to
[SPEAKER_01]: help people to make more educated
decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, um, some people can get hung up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if the soil test isn't what they deem
perfect, uh, you could have really good
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology and still do fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, the main, uh, basically with Logan
labs, we have a standard test and a
[SPEAKER_01]: saturated paste and a standard test uses
an extraction called Malik three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a stronger acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to show us, I try to put it
in layman's terms, like it's your savings
[SPEAKER_01]: account of minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all what is stored in your soil
and that you can eventually make
[SPEAKER_01]: available, but it's not necessarily
available at these levels right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the saturated paste, if they take
that same soil and grind it into a paste
[SPEAKER_01]: and then, uh, combine it with water and
then test what, what's at least the
[SPEAKER_01]: minimum levels of available nutrients to
your plant right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would show us maybe, um,
we have good, uh, cation balance on our
[SPEAKER_01]: standard tests, which is our calcium,
magnesium, potassium, and sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when we looked at our saturated
paste, maybe sodium and potassium is very
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then calcium's low and that shows us
that we got to work on that availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe we'll see the soil has a high pH
and phosphorus and some of the trace
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals are not as available.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when we look at the standard
tests, they're actually there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rather than applying more, let's work
on the microbiology and improving the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: to make them available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way that type of a test thing
works well with biological farming or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that we're looking at the whole thing
as a system and how these minerals will
[SPEAKER_01]: also benefit a lot of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's needed just like, uh, cobalt,
for example, with, with bacteria in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil becomes cobalamin, which is B12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a cofactor, which is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: For calcium availability, uh, nitrogen
fixation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's other process in the soil
that we're having all these minerals,
[SPEAKER_01]: even in just very small amounts can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we have a soil that is high in
calcium, there is something called a fizz
[SPEAKER_00]: test that you, that a grower can do to
determine what type of soil tests they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, um, when we, we look at the soil,
there's a number, uh, value called total
[SPEAKER_01]: cash and exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we imagine that is like a bucket
and the bigger the bucket is, the more
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients the soil can hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can happen is people can apply a
lot of calcium carbonate, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: oyster shell, flour, ag, lime,
or maybe even dolomite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's soil that's say only has a TSE
of 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can hold like 4,000 pounds an acre
of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes people are applying,
you know, 10, 12,000 pounds an acre of
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in essence, we have 8,000 pounds of
free calcium in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take a sample of that soil and
you mix it with vinegar, it will fit
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's showing there's all the
calcium carbonate is reacting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what can happen is that can really
elevate your pH and it can throw off the
[SPEAKER_01]: test because when you have very,
very high calcium, that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: suppress the magnesium, potassium,
and sodium value, maybe lower than what
[SPEAKER_01]: you actually got.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when you look on your pace test,
it usually shows there, Oh, we've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: really high level of available sodium and
calcium is just a lot of free calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can get a test, an ammonium acetate
that's done at a pH of 8.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that gives us an idea of how much
available calcium there is versus free
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I can recalculate the total exchange
capacity and then give someone a
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendation to then balance that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so just to summarize what you're
sharing, essentially the Malik 3 test or
[SPEAKER_00]: standard soil test from Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just using Logan Lab because
that's the lab that we both earlier in our
[SPEAKER_00]: careers decided to do our testing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great labs out there,
but for us, it's very easy because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with their testing protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that Malik 3 test or standard soil
test is excellent for determining sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of what is in the soil, but not what's
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: That saturated paste test will then show
us what's available to the plant more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less right now, but not all of what is
actually in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two tests combined really give us
a full picture of sort of what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important if you're using a
potting soil in particular to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have excess calcium or free
calcium in that soil because it'll throw
[SPEAKER_00]: off the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why that AA test is recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a Fizz test, which I can put a
link to an example of how to go about
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that, it's really easy with the
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows you to just see what type
of soil test to request from Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sort of cover it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually if your soil's pH is above 7.2
or so, that's when that's recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're going to get elevated pH
because you have a large excess of calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: All cations can raise the pH, but a lot of
times it's people overdoing calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if they have a high levels of
calcium carbonate or bicarbonate in their
[SPEAKER_01]: water, it can grab available calcium and
form more calcium bicarbonate,
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't available to the plants and
further elevating the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's important to get a
water test as well, at least one time to
[SPEAKER_01]: see that there's nothing that has high
levels in your water that then could build
[SPEAKER_01]: up in your soil causing you issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a really good point
mentioning the water test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to give sort of an anecdotal
story here for listeners, something that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened recently in my life where I was
contacted by a farmer and asked if I could
[SPEAKER_00]: help consult on setting up... He's a
tomato farmer that was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was transitioning over to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I requested from him
was a soil test and a water test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that soil test, he's like,
well, I've already purchased soil from
[SPEAKER_00]: another company, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just said, can you get a soil test
of that so we know where we're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: and see how that soil looks so we can move
on from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got the soil test back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, it wasn't where... The target
levels weren't anywhere near where I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought they should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from talking to that company,
we weren't able to really get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: determination if this test was an anomaly
or if that was just the way all the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: was from this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what it ended up coming down
to was neither myself nor the farmer had
[SPEAKER_00]: enough confidence in using that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now he's sitting on the soil that
we're going to slowly try and balance over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, the point being is no
matter where you're getting your soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're purchasing soil, you should get
a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people aren't willing to give you
that soil test, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should probably look to another
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in addition to that, if you're
going right into the ground, you still
[SPEAKER_00]: need that soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is such an important tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing commercially and you're
committing to putting in a high value
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, I mean, this podcast is typically
listened to by cannabis growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you really do need to spend the $55
on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my soap box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn it back over to you,
Aaron, if there's anything you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: add.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's no better bang for your
buck when you look at what you could spend
[SPEAKER_01]: on nutrients or other products for 60
bucks for the saturated paste in the
[SPEAKER_01]: standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be a complete plus
extras.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all also going to include cobalt,
molybdenum, selenium, silicon,
[SPEAKER_01]: and EC, which could be a limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the micronutrients are very
important for regulating the
[SPEAKER_01]: macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could have everything else really
in check, a good environment, all your
[SPEAKER_01]: major minerals, but then lacking silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's needed to kick off the
whole sequence of silicon, boron,
[SPEAKER_01]: and calcium to then carry all the minerals
into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're not going to apply more or
something else when that's all you need
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're suggesting that they may
actually save money by getting the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test so that we're not over applying or
under applying any micro or
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I often see people who think they
have this expectation that the plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to remove all these minerals and
they blindly keep reamending the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't need to apply that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a customer that's a husband and wife
and the husband runs some fields and the
[SPEAKER_01]: wife runs some fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the husband got a soil amendment
recommendation and I told him,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some kelp and some nitrogen meal
and then the trace minerals needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he amended it and his wife couldn't
believe that that's all he needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she spent a lot of money buying all
these, you know, products marketed to
[SPEAKER_01]: growers from the hydro store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the husband did as good or
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next year she came in and
hired me to do her plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I told her, Hey,
this is all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have an abundance of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, did you have mites or aphids or
PM?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, yeah, how did you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, cause you're putting on
too much, you know, less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you see what's in the soil,
it's, it's really going to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she's like, okay, I'm going to try
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if I don't, I'm never going to see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then followed up with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, you know, recently, and,
and they were, she was super excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both doing really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause also as you do this, you know,
you're really building the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when it's a field, you can go
and take and turn the whole acre into a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all usable soil and do amazing,
you know, and a lot of people that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: a blocker to do an acre of potting soil
would be, you know, way out of their
[SPEAKER_01]: budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can request a soil test,
but then they don't really know what to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, they get a soil test done on a
soil or they get a soil test from another
[SPEAKER_00]: company that may be providing them with
soil or a nutrient or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do you do with that information?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very confusing to look at all these
numbers and, and understand them,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is one of the big challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd really like to, with you just
starting with a regular soil test,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we could work our way down that soil
report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, I'll put a copy of a sample soil
report on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people can kind of go and check that
out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just, do you happen to have a
Logan labs one in front of you that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could kind of go off of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want me to just kind of list the
things as we're working our way down the,
[SPEAKER_00]: down the report?
[SPEAKER_01]: I, yeah, I have a Logan labs report and
then I could share an example,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, of a soil and nutrient test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how I do a soil amendment
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I try to do is I go through each
item on this test and explain,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, are you, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you high, low, very high and where you
should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, then I tell you, here's how much
to apply for per yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you have a particular size field or
bed, I'll, I'll make the recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll invest on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I give instructions also how to
apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I give some tips too of based on
where you're at, you know, here's some
[SPEAKER_01]: suggestions to help you improve things
until the soil gets more balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe you've got a very high
potassium and sodium and that's inhibiting
[SPEAKER_01]: your manganese uptake feed of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just kind of go through a test and
then some of the values and that are on
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that sound?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a few sentences about each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's quite a few of this could
turn into a really long podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's yeah, let's work our way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go ahead and let you take it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the test is going to come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a, um, a sample
location and a sample ID, a lab number.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more just for identifying your
sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you send in various samples and,
um, I want to just really quick talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil sample before I go into that too,
cause we didn't cover that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's good to take a composite sample
of maybe 15 or different places in your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good to use wear gloves so that
way you don't transfer sodium from your
[SPEAKER_01]: hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're using a shovel or a spade or
something, you don't want it to be rusty
[SPEAKER_01]: because that can transfer iron over to
your sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically I want to take 15 or more
core samples, combine all those,
[SPEAKER_01]: mix them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm sending two cups of soil into
Logan labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that bag, I will write,
you know, my name, email, and then an ID
[SPEAKER_01]: to, so that way I know what's a bed one,
bed two, and that's going to correlate
[SPEAKER_01]: with, with your farm or garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a problem area,
you could take a separate sample for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, um, that's how you're going to
get a composite sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then back to our test, uh,
the, after we have our ID and lab number,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to say total exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be a number to give
us, uh, how much nutrients the soil can
[SPEAKER_01]: hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this particular, uh, soils,
uh, 15 total exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if it's below 10, uh, it doesn't hold
a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes you may have to fertilize
more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, some crops may need another top dress
mid before you go in the flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're bedding a longer time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the TC's flow 10, and then all my
recommendations are going to be for a
[SPEAKER_01]: lower amount of minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next is the pH of the soil sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, ideally want that around six to six,
five pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, as the pH climbs above seven,
we lose exchangeable hydrogen and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: harder for the plant to get the minerals
out in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next value we have is organic matters
in a percentage and organic matters is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be very important for our soil
food web and the microbiology,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for each percentage of organic matter
is going to release nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ideally want that above 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the soil list mixes,
uh, peat moss comes back right fresh out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 90% organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Logan tends to test a little higher
than other labs on organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I wanted to add about organic
matter too, is the higher your organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter is, if you have a good microbial
activity, the less, you know, quote
[SPEAKER_00]: unquote soil you're going to have at the
end of your cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like in a raised bed in your
garden, you know, every year it goes down
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that process of all your organic
matter breaking down slowly into humus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not a, it's not a bad thing,
but that higher, that number, keep that in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind because you may have to replace more
soil the following season to get,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially we'll see that more so on
native soils where they really need the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter built up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, of course, after time, everything's
became humified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it could be the same case with soil
list mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but they tend to, to get heavier in
time when, when it's really, you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: things right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the next value we're going to have on
the test is anions and we're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur and that ideally one, at least a 35
PPM of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could go as high as equal to
phosphorus on the sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, phosphorus is then next and it showed
as P two Oh five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we multiply times 0.44 to get actual
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I wanted to add about sulfur is
that's where a lot of our odors and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors, our terpenes come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that we have that,
that sulfur in there so that we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: that expression in our final flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're growing, if we're growing
cannabis, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also important for a nitrogen
oxidase, you know, processing nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that way there, it doesn't have
free ions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause that's what can be a calling
card for tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when the plant is not processing the
proteins, it's processing the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: into complete proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: When there's a sulfur slacking,
uh, that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also elemental sulfur can attract
sulfur reducing bacteria, which combined
[SPEAKER_01]: with your soil, getting some runoff can
help to lower the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you have excess cations like
calcium, magnesium, potassium,
[SPEAKER_01]: or sodium, the sulfur will combine with
calcium, make calcium sulfate and then
[SPEAKER_01]: help to reach excesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And calcium sulfate is gypsum just for
people that may not be familiar with that
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the easiest ways to raise
your sulfur levels and also maintain your
[SPEAKER_00]: pH while getting calcium in there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also get it in a solution
grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, if you're not killing your
soil, it's easier to irrigate in and
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately raise the available calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so that's what's next on the test
is the exchangeable cations and that it
[SPEAKER_01]: shows calcium and it will show us our
desired value and then the value found
[SPEAKER_01]: and, um, the same goes, we'll have
magnesium, potassium, and sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after those are listed,
it's going to show us the base saturation
[SPEAKER_01]: of calcium and, uh, magnesium,
potassium, sodium, and exchangeable
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're shooting for at least 68% house
on the calcium, uh, 10 to 12 on the
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium, three to five, potassium,
and ideally we want 1.5% or less sodium
[SPEAKER_01]: and then exchangeable hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, ideally we want a pH in the range of
six to six, five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for each point of pH drop below,
below seven, we gain 1.5% exchangeable
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrogen all the way down to a pH of six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, pH of seven, you have zero
exchangeable hydrogen, 6.9, it's 1.5%,
[SPEAKER_01]: 6.8 is 3% and so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, when you look at a lot
of those charts that show pH, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really showing you how much hydrogen
you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how the plant has easier time
getting the minerals out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The higher you push it above, uh,
seven, sometimes that can cause problems
[SPEAKER_01]: with availability of phosphorus and trace
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I add a couple of notes here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for new, new people looking at these
tests, uh, keep in mind that the part
[SPEAKER_00]: where it says exchangeable cations there,
where they have a desired value and value
[SPEAKER_00]: found that desired value is based off of
your cation exchange capacity or your
[SPEAKER_00]: total exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea being is that exchange
capacity is sort of your sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I like to describe it, you use savings
account and it's like, how are we filling
[SPEAKER_00]: that sponge or that savings account?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we filling it with?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's easier to just skip down
to sort of the base saturation percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, okay, well my sponge is 60%
calcium, 20% magnesium, or whatever those
[SPEAKER_00]: levels come back as reflected on the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know you and I have talked about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to run potassium slightly higher
because I see multiple tests coming,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the potassium, cannabis using
potassium faster than some of,
[SPEAKER_00]: than say calcium or necessarily magnesium,
um, which I'm totally open to your
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, again, these are target levels
that are sort of established by,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, by consultants or by agronomists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there really isn't any, uh,
anything I've seen officially for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all sort of based on what
target levels we all think, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: at based on our own experiences are
optimal for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's to give you a range, you know,
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course there's going to be
different situations, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe somebody's a high intensity farming
in a controlled environment where they
[SPEAKER_01]: have CO2 and, uh, more things in hands
versus somebody who's doing a full term
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor or a different situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find that, um, the potassium you
know, cannabis, it does, uh, like a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, but if it's an excess,
it will inhibit the uptake of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's really important I found was how
much was potassium was in the soil to
[SPEAKER_01]: start and then going from there,
because a lot of times, um, people mix
[SPEAKER_01]: compost, feed and all their, uh,
amendments, and then they add all the
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments and test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they never saw where they were to
start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of skewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then when I look at the pace test,
it'll usually be potassium is very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I use a sap meter, I can test how
much calcium potassium is getting into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen on, cause I grew in the soil
that had, you know, 15% potassium and I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to see how long it would take to
correct itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how long does it take?
[SPEAKER_01]: The leach out and fix that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would always see three to 6,000 PPM
of potassium and calcium would never be
[SPEAKER_01]: above a hundred and 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after growing in that, and it got down
to 5% potassium, uh, I was seeing 3000
[SPEAKER_01]: plus PPM of calcium in the plant and my
bricks would be 18 to 20 plus before that
[SPEAKER_01]: it would all, it would be seven to maybe
10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it made a big difference in that
instance, cause the soil was built with a
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very high level of potassium and
sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really large amount of compost was added
and it took a lot of time to really
[SPEAKER_01]: balance out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until I saw the pace test
that it really showed how out of balance
[SPEAKER_01]: it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause when I look at the standard test,
all the numbers look great and I found a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people had a misrepresentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my standard test looks fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are my plants yellowing and seeing
these problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the sodium is much more available
and the potassium is much available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like a teeter-totter that's
skewed towards potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want it more calcium to be 60%,
not potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a little spoon feeding,
a little bit of that gypsum really helps
[SPEAKER_01]: to balance that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why a lot of people say,
Oh, you need CalMac cause it's doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's really interesting to see that
and have people tell me, Oh, this is what
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, be able to correct that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've seen it many, many times now
where people said, Hey, my plants are,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're yellowing that are, you know,
the tips are burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and they have a high pH,
a lot of carbonate, a lot of potassium and
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium and a high, really high chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also not a good home for the
microbiology to thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so we're going to start working
on our soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got this home that's full of
chloride and sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to get dehydrated out,
not do their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting that balance really helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the soil food web balance and they
compliment each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I found and shared with
the guy who mentored me, Hey, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've applied popper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I applied these trace minerals and I'm
seeing better results than before at small
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as damaging as, as thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, in some instances it's,
it was the limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gets onto our micronutrients on
the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, if you get a standard test
without the extras, you'll have boron,
[SPEAKER_01]: iron, manganese, copper, sink,
and aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we request extras, we'll also get
cobalt, molybdenum, selenium, silicon,
[SPEAKER_01]: and EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ideally we also want to see
ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause then we can really take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Age, whether we need to apply a nitrogen
meal or not, or whether there was a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: access, um, and people can make a more
educated decision on what to apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for those minerals like boron,
um, the levels that we want to see is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to vary on your TEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're below 10 or 10, you want to see
at least one PPM versus you're at a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: TEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to see two to three PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron is next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I often see iron is very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a lot of times people, uh,
will, the compost is high in iron,
[SPEAKER_01]: castings is high in iron, and then some of
the rock dust are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, iron does have issues with
availability, um, as well, especially when
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH is higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, manganese is another one I often see
is lacking and we have all the conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: for manganese deficiency and a lot of the
living soils that are built.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have high levels of carbonate,
high levels of organic matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, high.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a free calcium that can
contribute to a problem with manganese,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, if sodium and calcium on the base
saturation is above 10%, the plant's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to pick up manganese from the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then iron and manganese are
antagonistic to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: High iron suppresses manganese and high
manganese will suppress iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to see, uh, about half the
manganese to the iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we can even push them pretty close,
but we don't want manganese going above
[SPEAKER_01]: iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, copper is, uh, very important for
disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have very high nitrate
nitrogen, it's going to suppress the
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake of copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd like to see at least four PPM of
copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then think that's going to be
important for phosphorus and other,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, leaf size and evenness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to see, uh, eight PPM of zinc,
at least up to maybe 12, uh, aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to see under 200 PPM of aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's usually okay on most,
uh, soil list mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more native soils where I see higher
levels of aluminum, or if somebody has
[SPEAKER_01]: overly applied azomite to their soil list
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seen a guy apply a half a cup of cubic
foot and he had a four or 500 PPM of
[SPEAKER_01]: aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's way, way too much in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually, if someone's going to use
azomite, it's better to stick to a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: grams or less a yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now I have a question about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, because I was under the understanding
that, uh, that azomite was high in
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when I went back and look at one
of their tests of what they're claiming on
[SPEAKER_00]: the label, the aluminum levels were
actually quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've sort of pulled back on my state
and my statement there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen otherwise or anything else
to reflect that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's where I was told that
concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I saw a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the, you know, customer's aluminum
was very, very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we followed up on the phone after
his test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, what did you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, Oh, I built a, you know,
a tube mix and I didn't have any rock
[SPEAKER_01]: dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I had was azomite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I applied it at a half cup per cubic
foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, you know, unless there was
some other factor, like he had a compost
[SPEAKER_01]: high in aluminum or something,
then I could be wrong, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wasn't sure if you had heard
otherwise, but that's just one instance
[SPEAKER_01]: that then I played it safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Hey, if, if you better have a
diversity of other rock dust, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: found, uh, the, unless it was a glacial
rock dust, uh, a lot of the other base,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of those was, was higher in iron and
wasn't as in balance of the other trace
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stick into a small smaller amount of
rock dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still want it, but then I wanted to
bring up those trace mineral levels by
[SPEAKER_01]: using, you know, sulfate trace minerals,
which if you get a soil test and you show
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're lacking, that's OMRI and
national organic program approved as
[SPEAKER_01]: organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the other importance of getting
a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're going to make a more educated
decision of what you're going to apply,
[SPEAKER_01]: just what's needed and then help minimize
any, uh, runoff or, you know, like excess
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen or phosphorus, even though it's
organic, it still can do harm to the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the soil testing can really help you to
dial in those levels and bring up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what's the lowest common
denominator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it may be just, you know,
you've got silicon or we would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you got a real high excess of some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's causing you a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're referring to is all of
these are available in a sulfate form more
[SPEAKER_00]: or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get iron sulfate or manganese
sulfate or copper sulfate or zinc sulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, where they're already
chelated to sulfur and they are not
[SPEAKER_00]: organic, but they're allowed for use in
organic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a soil test that shows a
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them are listed OMRI organic
on it, but that's where people get
[SPEAKER_01]: confused because, you know, it's something
mine, but there was a manmade interaction,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and those, some of those like
copper is 25% copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by applying a small amount,
you know, like nine grams of cubic yard,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to bring those levels up
versus if I was just spoon feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: something that was a lower level of copper
that works well as a bandaid, but it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't bring the levels enough to up
enough in the soil to correct a
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I had tested that at
first, you know, like using, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, bottle products that were small
percentages, 2%, 0.5% boron and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and supplying them and then doing another
soil test and saying, Hey, that can raise
[SPEAKER_01]: my levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, that felt a lot like
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fertilizer salesman selling you the
stuff wants you to buy more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I'm going to test this and apply
these trace minerals and then see what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the guys I was working with were
working with vegetable farmers with
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of acres and they didn't have the
budget or, or, you know, uh, material to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply it accurately versus cannabis
growers usually have raised better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beds are plots and it's not always acres
where we can really amend that soil and do
[SPEAKER_01]: each bed and test each bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that on two beds and tested and
applied the trace minerals and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: within less than 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was very on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I did is I took all the trace
minerals, I mixed them with water and then
[SPEAKER_01]: I applied them to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I could apply them very evenly
because imagine trying to spread you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 5.5 grams of boron across 200 gallons of
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be easy to get a little hotspot or
sprinkle it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by combining with water, we can mix it,
spread it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would bring those mineral levels up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't have to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore I can grow more plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to come out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I compost them or bring it back in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to help make those minerals
even more available and I can close the
[SPEAKER_01]: loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it may seem, okay,
we're bringing in these minerals to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just trying to build that up and
therefore we don't have to do it anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: because then all the plants, animals,
humans, all is going to be getting that
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient dense, uh, crops or food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everything is healthier down the
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to mention that, uh,
you talked about those bottled products
[SPEAKER_00]: and essentially the two companies that I'm
familiar with that are making,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, chelated bottled nutrient products
that are approved for organics would be
[SPEAKER_00]: Albion and Biomin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we carry the Biomin line.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I like about them is
there's something that can be watered in
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the grow cycle for,
as a way of raising those levels and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: available a little bit sooner to the plant
than say something like copper sulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we have to be very careful with our
application with, uh, because of its
[SPEAKER_00]: potential toxicity and plant response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're adding so little, like you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally agree with you on a
commercial scale or on farmland or
[SPEAKER_00]: acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make a lot of sense to use
these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have, you know, a facility or a
smaller garden, then I think these
[SPEAKER_00]: products may have a sort of niche there
where they may have benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to make that distinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to elaborate that those
are good as band-aid fixes until you get
[SPEAKER_01]: the minerals built up and available.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, uh, TM7 is another one you could
use or, uh, where we're going to spoon
[SPEAKER_01]: feed those trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after a run or two, we've built all
those levels up where it could just be
[SPEAKER_01]: done a few times or monthly rather than a
weekly to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause, cause for example, manganese
has a max application rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so usually it can take three or four
times to really get the manganese up to
[SPEAKER_01]: half a iron in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that gives us a way to foliar and
trench a small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can help things to make sure
there's plenty for the soil and the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're, they're not going to be
deficient because a lot of those also are
[SPEAKER_01]: not mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by tossing applying that manganese and
calcium, you're going to ensure that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: always in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, then you're going to get your soul
food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your soul is going to become more bio
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that won't be needed as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can, it can really help because when
you foliar spray, the roots exude more
[SPEAKER_01]: sugars exudates, which then speeds up the
microbiology and healthy plants will make
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy soil faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are studies that show that the
plant is able to buffer the pH based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the exudates it's putting out into the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if your soul pH is a little off,
the pH in the rhizosphere could actually
[SPEAKER_00]: be closer to optimal for the plant,
which I thought was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a university of gales or,
uh, they just had a study.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were showing pH up to 7.4 wasn't
showing up to 7.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Showing any visual problems in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where it helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I feel more testing needs to be done
because I hear that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will, the plant was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a plant can have a lot of hidden
deficiencies and what looks fine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's really not, it could be improved
from where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have greater pest and disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have greater higher bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by using these other tools,
it helps us to get a better idea of our
[SPEAKER_01]: baseline, where we're at and how we can
make improvements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see a lot of assumptions being made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the plant's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've tested it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it seems to be the norm where
instead of, Hey, let's, let's not look at
[SPEAKER_01]: this with an ego at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at it, try to ask the plant and
see what we can do, you know, just when
[SPEAKER_01]: you go to, you know, blueberry growers or
something, he's not, there's not all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that ego sometimes too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not always the case,
but, um, it's always interesting that
[SPEAKER_01]: people will tell me this, that the,
you know, our plants are super healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll go there and see that
they're, you know, high in nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bricks is five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely room for
improvement, you know, and it's not to put
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just trying to say, Hey, let's look
at how we can improve things and become
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficient because then you need less
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the soil becomes more balanced,
it becomes less extractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not going to lose those minerals
from the soil as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything is going to be getting into
the plant much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really interesting, you know,
when you look at a, you know, rainforest
[SPEAKER_01]: or something, the, you know, it doesn't
have a high EC, but everything is thriving
[SPEAKER_01]: because everything's being delivered by
microbes, microbial metabolites and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and exchanging with them,
they're giving it back what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes, you know, a lot of times
that, um, we want to help things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can do too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by having some tools to gauge what to
do, it can help make more educated
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions and better results, you know,
and in turn it can save money too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're not over applying
fertilizers either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about the
saturated pace test here, just to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: things moving along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else though,
you wanted to add about the, the standard
[SPEAKER_00]: test before we did?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that covers everything,
but you want to write in your test,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you get one from Logan in the comments,
you write complete plus extras.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you get the nitrogen,
the ammonium, nitrogen, the cobalt,
[SPEAKER_01]: molybdenum, selenium, silicon,
and EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that will also get you a
saturated pace test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to go over to the saturated paste,
it starts off with the water used.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I send in my water and get it
tested, they could also perform the
[SPEAKER_01]: saturated paste with your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get a more realistic idea of what's
happening in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's going to show us the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to show us the soluble salts,
which, uh, it's going to show us chloride,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, which is important to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if that's too high, that can inhibit
other anions or inhibit the microbiology
[SPEAKER_01]: from going, uh, bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we don't, we want 50 to a hundred PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, that would show us maybe our
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, at an excessive bicarbonate,
um, sulfur, we want to see at least five
[SPEAKER_01]: PPM, uh, available phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we want to see at least 0.5 PPM there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're going to see that's much lower,
uh, than what we see on our standard
[SPEAKER_01]: tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the highest isings, maybe a hundred
something PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And compost and in the soil, I saw 54 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we're looking,
maybe our 30, 40 PPM or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that way we know our micro resiase
doing its job and we're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: hammering it with excessive phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more important pH and microbial
activity to get your phosphorus more
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the next we're going to have our
calcium and PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our magnesium, our potassium and sodium,
and all those are just listed in PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then below that, we're going to have our
percentage of cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there, that's where we want to
compare to our base saturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd like to see at least 60% calcium,
20% magnesium, 15% potassium and 5% or
[SPEAKER_01]: less sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that was to the other way,
it could tell us that we have maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium availability problem, or we would
see on our standard tests, maybe we have
[SPEAKER_01]: really high sodium and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then past that, it gets into the trace
elements, uh, boron, iron, manganese,
[SPEAKER_01]: copper, zinc, and aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So boron, we'd like to see at least 0.1
PPM, iron 0.3 PPM, manganese 0.15 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copper 0.5 PPM, zinc 0.1 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind, this is water with your
soil made into a paste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the acids exudates from your roots is
probably stronger than this and can
[SPEAKER_01]: probably extract higher levels of
nutrients than what we're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least we know what's our lowest
common, you know, baseline of what is
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does it differ from our base test?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could see, for example, maybe copper
is at, um, 3 PPM, but I got 0.5 PPM copper
[SPEAKER_01]: on my paste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, then we could avoid, you know,
adding more because we have plenty
[SPEAKER_01]: available copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by using both these tests, I can make a
more educated decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: On, on what's available and what to work
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as we do another run and do
another test, we can see, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe we improve that cation exchange
balance on calcium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, and sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought up available phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, we see things coming to
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watering is very important in this because
when we're adding a lot of these uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, meals, for example, we're not
putting them in an accumulated form that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant can immediately uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting them in a form where the
microbiology in the soil needs to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down these nutrients into a form,
an ionic form that the plant can then take
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this is controlled by the
plant itself, by the, the exudates it's
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out into the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's an important
distinction to mention because when we
[SPEAKER_00]: water improperly, what we're doing is
we're slowing down that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So less nutrients are going to become
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if our saturated paste test may
show, uh, these level of nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: available, we could still potentially see
deficiencies if the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions around the plant are not
optimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if you're not tracking it
and the, you know, you, you're seeing your
[SPEAKER_01]: EC PPM drop and you're, you're,
you're not doing anything to bring that
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That backed up or you're not the soil food
web is not improving to then bring up the
[SPEAKER_01]: available minerals there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, um, you know, it's going to require
some interaction on your part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the difference being we're
feeding the soil versus the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using water insoluble yet plant
available amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way the microbiology can break it
down and deliver it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, uh, yeah, watering, very,
very important, you know, see a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: under and overwatering and then,
um, getting, getting that right moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: level can be tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially in the cases, sometimes
people have high sodium and need a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of push through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much that, uh, you know,
the term flush, I think, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's defined by some people's being,
it is taken the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, we don't necessarily want to flush
three times the volume of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but to get a little runoff when you do
have an excess can definitely help you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and that's where the soil test
really helps to know whether that's needed
[SPEAKER_01]: or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times if we're running blue
mats and when we're sticking it that nice,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, moisture level, that's not happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, coming in with a wand,
uh, applying a compost extract or getting
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of a push through there helps
to prevent the sodium from building up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing we had, you know,
salt water, we evaporated the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the salt becomes very concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, a lot of the compost, then we
have, uh, a lot of iodine items from the
[SPEAKER_01]: ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they all tend to be kind of high in
sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so does, uh, you know, manure tends to
be as well, dairy manure that's been,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, composted too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're seeing, you know, when the
compost is really finished, then those
[SPEAKER_01]: levels tend to drop as, as, and get more
balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that you see in general,
uh, more commonly across tests?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we were just talking about high
sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, which like you mentioned can be
leached out through, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: watering a bed at higher levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other things that you tend to
see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like I know we've talked about maybe,
uh, over application of calcium carbonate
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of, uh, calcium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using gypsum over, uh, lime products,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see that often because also it
wasn't accounted for what was in the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the composts are already very
high in calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need to apply all that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can vary, you know, where you are,
you know, in the country, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: each source is different to assume that
all of it is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a really big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a Midwest compost that had an EC
of six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen compost on the East coast,
and then it didn't have much nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of the stuff on the West
coast is really loaded up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by testing, it really helped to see
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I often see, you know, uh,
there's no trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trace minerals are lacking,
uh, excessive sodium and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the pH is often very high because
people keep amending with more calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonate and, uh, keep driving that up
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's better to see where you're
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got plenty of calcium,
you know, then you can stop applying that
[SPEAKER_01]: and just spoon feed a small amount is much
more effective than putting large,
[SPEAKER_01]: large amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a little bit is good, a little bit less
more often is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, uh, a lot of people, that's what I
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just over applying things and,
uh, not getting, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: once they start to understand the balance
more and how some of those deficiencies
[SPEAKER_01]: are an excess caused by an excess,
then that really helps to balance thing
[SPEAKER_01]: out, you know, um, rather than thinking,
Oh, I got a, you know, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium deficiency and keep applying the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The magnesium raises the pH 1.6 times more
than the other cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really takes a long time to,
to correct itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times we already got plenty of
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So applying more isn't the best case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, doing a foliar spray can correct your
magnesium deficiency and then bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: your sodium and potassium down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause usually it's, it's one of those
being high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, why there's a magnesium
deficiency or someone really overdid the
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium and that can cause you magnesium
deficiency too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally it's low, but most of the
time hundreds of tests, I see it's usually
[SPEAKER_01]: high and look at peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 12% out the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's already got a good amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for someone that wants to learn more
about, uh, soil testing and mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing, a lot of the concepts that
we've talked about today, are there any
[SPEAKER_00]: books or resources that you'd like to
mention?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, you know, Steve Solomon's book,
uh, the intelligent gardener is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, hands on agronomy by Neil Kinsey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a student of Albrecht and he's been
doing this for years and applying the
[SPEAKER_01]: field and sharing the results he's
getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a really good book too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the ideal soil is good, but that book
ignores max application rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why, uh, it gives you more
information, but I prefer solid
[SPEAKER_01]: developments book and Kinsey because they
both talk about max application rates and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, how, um, that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, some, some cases, uh, you know,
people ignore those, uh, max rates and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it cause problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd rather play it safe and do with
something that's showing the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't see people have problems
if they just, you know, go slow and build
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil in time rather than, uh,
overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a book, uh, more fluid
from soil science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an older book and it's, uh,
you know, it talks about just testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, using higher levels of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we got to consider, well,
what were they testing at that time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they using a male?
[SPEAKER_01]: At three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we have the AA 8.2 and learn
more, uh, that I feel, Hey, we can maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: push calcium a little higher, 70 to 75%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going higher isn't always the best
case because as we make that calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: available in time, it can cause more
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I seen us do a series of tests and
you do a standard test and then a pace
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then apply more calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then do the standard and do the base
test pace test again, and see the calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: availability improves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a customer, he thought,
okay, I need to apply 12,000 pounds an
[SPEAKER_01]: acre of calcium to get my pace test
looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it put his soil at 85% calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the end of his plants did good,
but by the end of the first one,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he replanted everything was yellowing
the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH was seven, five and above.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was, it was just no potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: He caused a lot of problems by not
accounting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was such a large amount of free
calcium that it costs problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found in seeing that it was helpful
to know, okay, we can spoon feed a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of calcium and help make it more
available, but we don't necessarily have
[SPEAKER_01]: to hammer it all the way up to 85%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, um, in the book more foods from soil
science, he preaches that because he's
[SPEAKER_01]: testing things and in 90% of the time,
more calcium improve the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that that's very crude,
but we, we gotta be smart about it and
[SPEAKER_01]: just not go willy nilly on calcium and
ignore everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I seen some people then realize the
importance of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're, they're getting to,
um, emphasizing the calcium so much to not
[SPEAKER_01]: think about balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add within this world of mineral
balancing or soil balancing, there's quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a few experts that have very different
beliefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, and I may be mispronouncing
his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always said Tejans is one of the ones
that tends to go with higher calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Arden Anderson is another one as
well, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, what I suggest Tejans,
Tejans, Arden Anderson's more in the make
[SPEAKER_01]: it available, uh, apply the B12,
the cobalt and work on it like a different
[SPEAKER_01]: mode of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way he explains is, is imagine your
base calcium in your soil is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: charcoal project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a little bit of liquid B12 or
calcium, uh, applied to that charcoal is
[SPEAKER_01]: like the lighter fluid that ignites
calcium availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what Arden Anderson teaches
versus Tejans was more like guinea
[SPEAKER_01]: pigging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's experiment and figure these things
out and test higher, higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I think my point was,
and once I started to test and look and
[SPEAKER_01]: calculate the TC with the AA.2 and the
Melec 3, I was seeing 70 to 75% was right
[SPEAKER_01]: the same as that 85 on a Melec 3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by balancing it more, we can get,
because I was seeing a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: they look at their pace test and they
can't get that 60% available calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were trying to hammer it higher
and higher to force it, uh, force down the
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium, the potassium and sodium,
because there's that rule of cation,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, displacement, you know, add more
calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that bumps off, it will lower the
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that bumps off, it will lower the
potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that bumps off and lowers the sodium,
as long as you've got that solution and
[SPEAKER_01]: the runoff, you know, you're getting that
drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just remind listeners that they
can always test these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best thing to do would be to set
aside, you know, one area and set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: trial, you know, use scientific method
control for a variable and, and test out
[SPEAKER_00]: what works out best for you with any of
the, you know, any of the podcasts guests
[SPEAKER_00]: I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an opportunity to experiment,
but experiment in a way that has
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually determine what the
controlling factor is in your results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's going to vary a little bit for
everybody and what cultivar they're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and what type of environment
they're in, but that's always going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the best plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm working with someone new and
they're maybe trying to switch from more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a conventional style to go into more of
a, you know, biological or organic system
[SPEAKER_01]: of growing, I'll have them try just a
light or thing and see that that works for
[SPEAKER_01]: them and then switch it over, you know,
cause everyone's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could see, you know,
what works for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people like, uh,
you know, are used to doing things a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain way and they're used to using a
bunch of, uh, different, uh, bottled
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they look at those as tools and
instead can say, look, here's,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's the same tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just making a stock solution or
we're using these dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the equivalent of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once people understand that,
then they, they feel more comfortable,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and knowing what to apply and
how much, and then seeing the response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I really appreciate you taking the
time out of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: To day to chat with me and, uh,
share some of your knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with listeners.
