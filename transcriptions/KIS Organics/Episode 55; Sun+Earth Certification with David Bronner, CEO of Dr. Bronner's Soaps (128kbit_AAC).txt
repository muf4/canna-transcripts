[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussey of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: This week's podcast is with David Brauner,
CEO, AKA Cosmic Engagement Officer for Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brauners, a top-selling brand of natural
soaps in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do they make the best soap,
but they've dedicated themselves to
[SPEAKER_01]: advocacy around our food supply,
regenerative organic agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: animal welfare, fair labor practices,
and responsible integration of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and psychedelic medicine into American and
global culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, this is one of the best
examples of how a company can operate
[SPEAKER_01]: ethically and sustainably in today's
society, and it was an honor to spend this
[SPEAKER_01]: time with David.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do an entire podcast just talking
about all the amazing things Dr. Brauners
[SPEAKER_01]: has done for the community and its
employees, but the main purpose was to
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss their partnership on the Sun and
Earth certification for cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_01]: nonprofit David has helped establish
called Brother David's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now onto the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey David, thanks for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I really appreciate you taking the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to start off just giving
listeners a little bit of background into
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of your own personal history and a
quick overview of the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my granddad, Dr. Brauner, founded our
company as a nonprofit religious
[SPEAKER_02]: organization in 1948-ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little hazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He himself was a third generation master
soap maker from a German Jewish soap
[SPEAKER_02]: making family.
[SPEAKER_02]: His grandfather began soap manufacturing
18 in 1958 in a small southern German town
[SPEAKER_02]: of Laupheim in the Jewish quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time he was coming of age,
his dad and two uncles had expanded the
[SPEAKER_02]: family business to be pretty much the
biggest soap maker in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a factory in Heilbronn,
another southern German town kind of in
[SPEAKER_02]: the heart of the manufacturing kind of
super center in southern Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was an apprentice to another master
soap making family and earned his master's
[SPEAKER_02]: certificate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the late 20s, when he was working
with his dad and two uncles, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was a 3D activist from day one,
a very Zionist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just personality wise,
just clashing with his dad a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his dad didn't really want him mixing
politics in soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as Hitler and the rise of
fascism, that wasn't clear at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more just out of the kind of
generational clash with his dad,
[SPEAKER_02]: my granddad came over in 1929 to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and set up shop in Chicago and Milwaukee,
became a consultant to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: soap industry, helped design factories and
launch products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And married and had three kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also was becoming increasingly
desperate with the rise of Hitler to get
[SPEAKER_02]: his family out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his two sisters got out.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, his youngest sister got out in 36,
at the age of 20, and ended up in a
[SPEAKER_02]: kibbutz in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't get kibbutz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was Lottie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Louisa got out in 38, right before the
close of borders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she eventually became, she came to the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and eventually became a professor of
German Hebrew at UMass Boston for a short
[SPEAKER_02]: stint.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a chemist herself and actually
made the waterproofing compound for
[SPEAKER_02]: American GIs going into Korea,
but then didn't get credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like her male whatever supervisor just
kind of screwed her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She quit and just got her PhD and became a
professor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, so Dr. Brown, my granddad's
parents were told in Francisca,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a lot of bourgeois Jews, that they
thought they were gonna ride out the
[SPEAKER_02]: madness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 1940, the factory was area-nized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then shortly thereafter, they were
deported and killed in the camps in 42 and
[SPEAKER_02]: 44.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also in this time, my granddad's
wife, my dad's mom, was very sickly and
[SPEAKER_02]: ended up out of hospital and died,
I think in 1945.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think my dad was two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a lot of just huge tragedy was
hitting my granddad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somehow in the midst of this,
he was having these mystical experiences
[SPEAKER_02]: of the oneness of humanity and all the
faith tradition and all the shamanic and
[SPEAKER_02]: faith traditions are pointing at the same
transcendent mystery that we're all
[SPEAKER_02]: children of and that at the deepest level,
it's about love and getting down and
[SPEAKER_02]: serving each other and loving each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: That in a nuclear-armed world,
if we didn't realize that transcendent
[SPEAKER_02]: unity across ethnic and religious divides,
we're gonna all perish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he felt urgently called on his mission
to unite space and earth and went about
[SPEAKER_02]: lecturing around the country, selling his
soaps kind of on the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he saw his soaps were kind of out of
fashion in the post-World War II era.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all about better living through
chemistry, from agriculture to plastics,
[SPEAKER_02]: to personal care, everything was moving to
a petrochemical basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my granddad early on saw the problem
that saturated our environment with all
[SPEAKER_02]: these toxic compounds and stayed true to
the natural, versatile, biodegradable soap
[SPEAKER_02]: formulas of his family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's going around lecturing on his
peace plan and kind of soon realizes
[SPEAKER_02]: people are coming more to get the soap,
which words gone out like, wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is some really good soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And realized people are coming more to get
the soap than stick around and hear what
[SPEAKER_02]: he had to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he started putting his message on every
label of our bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for him, the bottle was there to sell
the label.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as much as the label was there to
sell soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did found his company, he
considered it a non-profit religious
[SPEAKER_02]: organization with the rise of the
counterculture and hippies and the
[SPEAKER_02]: wholesale rejection of the war machine and
the era of sudden spring and the
[SPEAKER_02]: ecological catastrophe that was becoming
more and more apparent, the soaps has
[SPEAKER_02]: really resonated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of became the soap of the
generation that you could wash your hair,
[SPEAKER_02]: your dog, your dishes by the side of the
river and not worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And grew on this label of peace and love.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what really, I think,
cemented his place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he was part of our soap and part
of the health food store movement and the
[SPEAKER_02]: health food movement kind of through the
70s and 80s and then into the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then also in this period,
the IRS kind of stepped in or came down on
[SPEAKER_02]: my granddad and basically disagreed with
my granddad's tax exempt status.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my granddad was forced into bankruptcy
in the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my dad, mom and uncle Ralph at that
point, stepped in to kind of fire a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: bad advisors and write the ship and exit
as a for-profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have that non-profit DNA at the
heart of our business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my dad, for his part, he came up in a
series of foster homes because my granddad
[SPEAKER_02]: was off saving the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he financially supported my dad and
uncle and aunt, but wasn't really around
[SPEAKER_02]: as a father and kind of bailed on his
responsibilities in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my dad really compensated and he
went into the Navy at age 17, served for
[SPEAKER_02]: years, came out, worked for a bit for my
granddad, but then went on to run a
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical specialty operation or
manufacture in LA, even when my granddad
[SPEAKER_02]: moved down to Escondido here in North
County, San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my dad oversaw that he developed a
bunch of properties and products including
[SPEAKER_02]: firefighting foam and then a special
effects version of foam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I personally grew up working for my
dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then in the late 80s, so him and my
mom, so they stepped in, my granddad's
[SPEAKER_02]: health was failing at Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my dad and mom and uncle were running
Dr. Bronner's and then my dad was also
[SPEAKER_02]: running Bronner Chemical, which was his
independent, at that point his own
[SPEAKER_02]: independent chemical consultancy,
which primarily was dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: firefighting foam and then also special
effects foam for Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I grew up going to Alka-Seltzer and
commercial shoots, like blasting foam on
[SPEAKER_02]: trees and movie shoots and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: And grew up with my brother just blasting
foam on each other and it was super fun
[SPEAKER_02]: out of an inch and a half fire hose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my dad wanted nothing to do with my
granddad's cosmic trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he felt as soon as my granddad started
on the all one mission, my dad kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was all about family and community
and what can you do right here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in front of you?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's practical?
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you actually leverage and make a
difference in kind of near immediate
[SPEAKER_02]: sphere of influence?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and I very much came up under my
dad and really downloaded his kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: moral kind of compass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my granddad, it wasn't really until
after college when I was in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my granddad was amazing,
but just really sailed way over my head as
[SPEAKER_02]: a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just didn't grok it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we must unite the spaceship earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wasn't in the space yet,
so I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then in college, I started smoking a
lot of cannabis and just realizing just
[SPEAKER_02]: how beautiful music and friends and just
really prioritizing that and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: retiring from alcohol culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then going to Amsterdam in 95 and
intersecting the cannabis cup,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a Euro pass, went to Amsterdam and
really just got blown open and had some
[SPEAKER_02]: huge psychedelic experiences that really
kind of made clear that my granddad was
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% on point and he was exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that our deepest ground is love and
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that somehow this world of absurdity
and suffering, that that is the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what all these faith traditions
are pointing at when they're not making
[SPEAKER_02]: idols out of their own beliefs and symbols
and systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just kind of dedicated myself to
making the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also in this time, just realizing that
cannabis is a sacrament as our all
[SPEAKER_02]: psychedelic allies and that one is gonna
dedicate my life to ending the war.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that the drug war is in large part a
religious war on the sacraments of our
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my squat in Amsterdam, there's a
church in Arkansas in 1993 of all places
[SPEAKER_02]: called Our Church that formed with
cannabis as a sacrament and explicitly to
[SPEAKER_02]: make the First Amendment challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course in 93, I mean, they got
busted up, pretty quickly by the FBI and
[SPEAKER_02]: people were arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were two people that had escaped
and immigrated to Amsterdam and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: in my squat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just one of these guys was
Sam Smith, like just a real heavyweight
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he's up in the Northwest
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just a real spiritual cat,
just really dedicating his life to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis as a sacrament of higher
vibration living.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just very influential at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anyways, I came back, I became a
mental health, I came back and sold all my
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna move back to Amsterdam to grow
plants and activate, became vegan in this
[SPEAKER_02]: timeframe of just realizing the disaster
of Western consumption on a planet,
[SPEAKER_02]: just wrecking an environment, whole
ecosystems and communities around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world just being completely disrupted to
see the kind of capitalistic machine of
[SPEAKER_02]: making us tasty food and fabulous clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all the consumables that we
consume without thinking about it and how
[SPEAKER_02]: they're produced or who's producing them
or where they're coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just seeing that machine on the earth,
it's like a comet hitting the earth,
[SPEAKER_02]: just waking you up to that dimension of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just there's a whole series of
events and I came back to the States and
[SPEAKER_02]: became a mental health counselor in the
Wall Street in the Waltham Watertown area,
[SPEAKER_02]: suburbs of Boston, working primarily with
a paranoid schizophrenic population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my then, well, my girlfriend and then
wife, now recently accident, and she's
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing, Chris, she was finishing up
school and then we got pregnant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, and our baby Maya was born on
March 7th, 97.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this time, I've been doing this a
lot of debriding, of course, red Jack
[SPEAKER_02]: hairs, Amber wears no clothes and a lot of
different, just deep thinkers,
[SPEAKER_02]: but really got turned on to cannabis and
hemp as just such a powerful crop for
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial, for medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: For spiritual use and also realized that
if a company like Dr. Bronner offered me a
[SPEAKER_02]: job, I would go for it in a second,
leaving alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had really not wanted to do my own
thing, but then just realizing,
[SPEAKER_02]: wow, what a gift that an opportunity I
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I let my dad know, shortly around
when the birth of our daughter,
[SPEAKER_02]: and she was born on the same day Dr.
Bronner died, the same exact day,
[SPEAKER_02]: Maya was born, Dr. Bronner died.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I high-fived in and out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let my dad know, and then he was
diagnosed with stage four lung cancer
[SPEAKER_02]: shortly after.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fortunately, I'd already made that
decision to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came back and he'd be given six
months, but he lived for a little over a
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his goal was to see my sister married
to my brother-in-law, Michael,
[SPEAKER_02]: my sister, Lisa, which happened June 6th
of 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on June 12th, he passed and
transitioned and just an amazing man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had an amazing year together,
and it was just very intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just downloaded a lot of the ropes
and just the ethics and the way he rolled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the last things he did,
and so he died on June 12th, which was my
[SPEAKER_02]: uncle Ralph's birthday, his brother,
was one of the last things he did is give
[SPEAKER_02]: effectively one-third of our value,
our net worth was in 1,000 acres in East
[SPEAKER_02]: County, San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wanted to give that to the Boys and
Girls Club, which is kind of really cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of full circle, like the mentor
programs, the youth mentoring programs
[SPEAKER_02]: that helped him as a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all our advisors are like,
man, no, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have huge estate taxes from when my
granddad died.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my dad was like, Adam, and he's like,
no, we can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be all right, and this is
what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he, my mom, and my uncle Ralph
oversaw that gift and really just set the
[SPEAKER_02]: example and tone for what we were going to
be as a company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I came in, and this was me and my
mom initially, and then my brother after a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of years, I convinced to come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother Mike is now 50-50 with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's company president.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the cosmic engagement officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we put into place a five-to-one
compensation cap versus our lowest paid
[SPEAKER_02]: warehouse position.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that all profits not needed for the
business, we were going to dedicate to the
[SPEAKER_02]: charities and causes we believed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the first things we did was
we added hemp seed oil to the soaps in
[SPEAKER_02]: 1999.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thinking that we were on the verge of
re-commercializing, but also in part,
[SPEAKER_02]: opening up cultural space for cannabis and
just kind of hemp being at the perfect
[SPEAKER_02]: nexus of drug policy reform and
environmental sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being an example, the worst example of
an out of control hysterical drug war that
[SPEAKER_02]: would schedule a non-drug agricultural
crop as a schedule one drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then kind of got into it with the DEA
and we were in an extended battle from
[SPEAKER_02]: 2001 to 2004 that we were, when the DEA
tried to ban imports of hemp seed and hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: seed oil for food and body care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we beat them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time DEA was beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We funded the industry's legal defense,
help coordinate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we actually won Obama's
birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think February 6th, 2004.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a clean three, zero unanimous
victory in the ninth circuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in parallel was funding America's
Safe Access, Steph Sherr.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come out of the anti-globalization
movement to set up, she got tackled by a
[SPEAKER_02]: federal marshal and the IMF protest in DC
and really jacked her neck and was using
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to help heal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she founded the nation's most
effective patient advocacy group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we were big supporters of her and
Asa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in parallel, we were putting in
place understanding that our supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chains, that whatever cool stuff we do
here at headquarters with our employees
[SPEAKER_02]: and our manufacturing process,
that that's like 10% of our impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that 90 plus percent of our impact was
in our agricultural supply chains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how our materials are being grown and
processed matter way more than what we
[SPEAKER_02]: were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But turning that into soap in terms of
environmental and social impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for like most people, we bought on
price and spec.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just bought from brokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had no visibility or real interest in
knowing exactly where our stuff was coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from, just like pretty much everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just buy on the commodity market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But realizing that that's what's kind of
making the earth go to hell in a
[SPEAKER_02]: handbasket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that this is the race to the bottom,
pitting farming communities against each
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just leads to these huge corporate
industrial plantations, ripping up
[SPEAKER_02]: rainforest and displacing small family
farming communities off their land.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they become plantation workers for
slave wages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a horrible cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially around our tropical oils
like coconut and palm, and then olive oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mint oil were our main ingredients
along with the hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we set about identifying farming
communities that we could work in direct
[SPEAKER_02]: partnership with and on regenerative
organic terms, not using a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic inputs, synthetic pesticides and
fertilizers to produce our raw materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically trying to figure out how do
we farm in nature's image if you look at a
[SPEAKER_02]: forest, there's no external chemical
inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely self-regenerating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just been on just an amazing crash
course for the past 20 years, getting
[SPEAKER_02]: better and better and working in
partnership with our farmers and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: best practices as far as compost and cover
cropping and minimal soil disturbance and
[SPEAKER_02]: intercropping with complimentary tree
crops of different canopy heights to
[SPEAKER_02]: maximize photosynthetic capture and
biomass yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so carbon sequestration and yields are
much higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then so does income.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then making sure we're investing in
the communities where we're working in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've got really cool projects for
coconut in Sri Lanka and now a new one in
[SPEAKER_02]: Samoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a really cool palm project in
Ghana where we're intercropping cocoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: banana and cassava with the palm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's bio diverse, wildlife habitat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's always making sure there's
plenty of habitat for beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_02]: and predator insects and pollinators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in olive oil, we actually
partnered 90% of our olive oil comes from
[SPEAKER_02]: olive farmers from the West Bank and doing
all regenerative super rad projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to be clear, we're not
anti-Israel about it, although we do hate
[SPEAKER_02]: the occupation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the current government,
we source the balance half from a Jewish
[SPEAKER_02]: family farm and half from a Arab Christian
project in the Nazareth region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have Muslim, Jewish, Christian olive
oil in our soil, all organic and
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all this time too, we've been
using our profits to fund different causes
[SPEAKER_02]: and ballot campaigns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we engaged on the GMO labeling
campaign really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Against Montana and Japan, Dow,
and in Oregon, we came so close in 2014,
[SPEAKER_02]: we lost 800 votes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a heartbreak.
[SPEAKER_02]: But learned a lot, fighting three ballot
measures in a row there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In parallel, we're helping fund the
cannabis, sending cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, California has failed Prop 19.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even though we all thought it was a
bad idea to go in that year, in that time,
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember coming up Burning Man,
it was like, wow, I can't turn around
[SPEAKER_02]: without the first serious national
discussion happening about ending cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this really realizes the power of
these ballot measures to really advance
[SPEAKER_02]: the cultural conversation and kind of move
the needle so that you can win in
[SPEAKER_02]: subsequent years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And indeed we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We broke through in Washington,
Colorado in 2012, and Oregon, DC,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Alaska in 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually funded entirely the DC
campaign and our head of social action is
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Eidinger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was the campaign manager for
legalizing weed in the capital,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is huge just because we're talking
to the national leadership in the local
[SPEAKER_02]: media.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2016, obviously it was a huge year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also in this time, it was becoming
crystal clear that the same forces that
[SPEAKER_02]: were screwing up all the other commodity
crops in the world, that we had to put
[SPEAKER_02]: forth a lot of effort to kind of go
against and set up in a truly sustainable,
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those same corporate industrial forces
were moving big time into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of what was really helpful for us
in our just kind of normal raw material
[SPEAKER_02]: supply chains and in our products is
having the USDA organic program and then
[SPEAKER_02]: also fair trade certification programs and
consumer facing programs that could really
[SPEAKER_02]: tell, authentically communicate to
consumers who wanted to buy products that
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't go to hell and back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could certify with a third party that
this is a trust that you can trust that
[SPEAKER_02]: indeed this product was produced in the
way that you would want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this food, that apple, that t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we saw with cannabis that because
of federal prohibition, you couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: access the USDA organic program because
it's a federally regulated word.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we knew there were some pretty good
local certifications out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but nothing that seemed to have any real
traction and degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were interested in figuring out,
well, how can we kind of get some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: third party certification program that's
robust, that addresses not just soil
[SPEAKER_02]: health and land management, but also fair
labor practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in parallel, we're partnered with
Patagonia on the regenerative organic
[SPEAKER_02]: standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the regenerative organic alliance and
the website for that is regenorganic.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's this next level of certification
that takes the best of fair labor,
[SPEAKER_02]: soil health, and animal welfare and
pasture-based criteria into one single
[SPEAKER_02]: standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all in the pilot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to launch that early next
year for a full-scale commercial launch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of in parallel, we're in the
cannabis space kind of parallel to the
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We identified Andrew Black, who worked
with Oregon Tilt, who's our main organic
[SPEAKER_02]: certifier, and just really cool,
awesome cat driving a certified kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Jacob over in Colorado doing
cannabis conservancy, doing great work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we realized these are two really great
cats to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Flo Khanna really appreciated
their business model and that they very
[SPEAKER_02]: much have the ethics of going to market in
partnership with their farmers and not
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to play them off against each
other, and also really good sounding
[SPEAKER_02]: partner and to some other stakeholders,
mostly farmers, and then just identifying
[SPEAKER_02]: some just really kick-ass farmers who are
growing cannabis in a truly regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of them are multi-generational,
back to the lander.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their parents were part of the original
organic kind of revolution and are just
[SPEAKER_02]: growing really beautiful integrated farms
where cannabis is growing alongside
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables and just taking care of their
land right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And treating their people right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we helped bring everyone together,
just helped throw some fuel on the
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So long story short, Sun and Earth is a
certification standard specific to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, but basically is very similar to
regenerative organic in that it basically
[SPEAKER_02]: celebrates farmers and products and brands
that are sourcing and producing medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: in a righteous way, without chemicals in
the soil, under the sun, with fair labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just kind of tending their land right
and receiving prices from brands that are
[SPEAKER_02]: also certified that they can take care of
their land correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so I guess that's, oh yeah,
and then Brother David's was a,
[SPEAKER_02]: so then we're brainstorming, okay,
what's the most effective way of
[SPEAKER_02]: communicating Sun and Earth certification
in the market and to the trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we realized like actually launching a
brand, but that would be consumer facing
[SPEAKER_02]: and in the stores and talking to blood
tenders, but making it not for profit and
[SPEAKER_02]: being clear that we're not, we wanna see
all our competition certified Sun and
[SPEAKER_02]: Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're not out here to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just wanna create market presence and
consumer demand for Sun and Earth and have
[SPEAKER_02]: that be like the organic USDA seal or
Intel inside and just everybody can jump
[SPEAKER_02]: on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly what we wanna see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're now starting to see that and
there's a lot of interest and we're hoping
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna have a critical mass of farms
and brands so that by second quarter next
[SPEAKER_02]: year, there's a really high powered
marketing firm that wants to do a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: pro bono work for Sun and Earth,
but we wanna wait until there is like a
[SPEAKER_02]: critical mass of a certified product in
the market and brands before we kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: pull the trigger on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then that would be a pretty big
marketing campaign on behalf of Sun and
[SPEAKER_02]: Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess the other thing here
going on that's like super awesome,
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhat related, but maybe not the most
related, but awesome is the psychedelic or
[SPEAKER_02]: the psilocybin therapy campaign in Oregon
alongside a broad based drug policy
[SPEAKER_02]: reform.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say a general decriminalization of
all drugs and shift from mass
[SPEAKER_02]: incarceration to treatment measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's two measures in Oregon that
are right now being pull tested to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure they're viable, but we're pretty
optimistic that both will be so that in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon, you're gonna have a perfect storm
of psilocybin therapy and a shift to
[SPEAKER_02]: Portugal style decriminalization of all
drugs and treating addiction as a health
[SPEAKER_02]: problem and using tax revenues from
marijuana there to fund treatment centers
[SPEAKER_02]: and then introducing psilocybin therapy
into the culture in a really, in a way
[SPEAKER_02]: that license entrenched facilitators and
make sure that there's good preparation,
[SPEAKER_02]: good set and setting, good integration
afterwards and really optimize the
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutic outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's really exciting what's
happening up there and we've committed
[SPEAKER_02]: resources to both campaigns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but anyways, but shifting back to
Senator, yeah, we're just really excited
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, we're just the amount of
interest there is out there and yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: just hope to see more and more farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we just had our first Oregon
farmer certified senators, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, not in the brother
David's supply chain and that's also
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, so I guess that's, the
background to where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that was a lot of great information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so wonderful to hear your family's
history and that strong foundation in sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of ethics and morality that's been
expressed and the history of activism
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really been passed down
generationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of questions, but since we
last talked about sun and earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: why don't we just dive in with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've talked about how it's this
regenerative organic certification that
[SPEAKER_01]: just goes so far beyond anything that
currently exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people can, I'll put all the links
online here so people can read more about
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what that certification entails.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not going to go into all those
details.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably have Andrew on to talk more
about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you talked about this need for a
unifying certification around regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on that a little bit more as
to like the importance from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as someone who has a background in,
you know, understanding sort of marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: and large scale distribution of things,
how important is this certification from
[SPEAKER_01]: that perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, first I do want to shout
out to Dempere and, you know, Biodynamic
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, there's other real quality
efforts and standards out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we see that we're in
solidarity and an alliance with all the
[SPEAKER_02]: high bar standards out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we do really feel there is
a need for sun and earth in that third
[SPEAKER_02]: party kind of system for consumer,
especially when you want to get the scale
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have distance between the consumer
and the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that third party is, you know,
and then like multi ingredient products
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that, that third party
verification is pretty key.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think for, you know,
that, yeah, the importance of a
[SPEAKER_02]: certification in the first place is,
you know, it's easy to talk the talk,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's much harder to walk the
walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the certification is a way of like kind
of breaking through the greenwashing to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, sincerely communicate,
honestly communicate to consumers that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this indeed was produced to the
highest bar, you know, regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: organic criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then, yeah, the marketing
campaign, I mean, it's just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: crucial that there's a lot of noise in the
market and a lot of competing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's as important that,
you know, put together a good
[SPEAKER_02]: communication campaign so that,
you know, consumers are aware of what this
[SPEAKER_02]: is about, you know, why it's important and
why they should look for it and buy these
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm up here in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was grateful for your contributions that
Dr. Bronner's made towards the GMO
[SPEAKER_01]: labeling campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was where I first really started
hearing about your advocacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of the organic movement up
here in Washington state, because we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: use the word organic on any of our
products, it gets really sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to know how things were
grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a big challenge here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a lot of issues with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: The use of illegal pesticides,
known carcinogens, even with regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: and testing by the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know as a consumer, I have very
little trust level in what's being
[SPEAKER_01]: produced here in Washington without having
a personal relationship with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think allowing greater access and
greater confidence in what's being
[SPEAKER_01]: produced is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then right there, I mean, that's the
problem, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so much pesticides and
crap in a lot of the flowers being grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so Sun and Earth is definitely a
way of guaranteeing that's not happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like if you don't know your
cultivator, you know, you can trust like a
[SPEAKER_02]: Sun and Earth product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of exactly the point that
we're wanting to achieve here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to clarify, Sun and Earth is only
for people that are growing in soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors, under the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't offer a certification option
for people that are growing in indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think there's some level of like
some light depth might be allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as far as like the first few
weeks or something can be in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's some reasonable
allowance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, but the general point is like we
want it to be like in the soil and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, farm like, you know,
most things or, you know, most crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that said, I mean,
there's a whole spectrum of indoor and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there are much more ecological
ways of growing indoors, obviously,
[SPEAKER_02]: than others and very much appreciate,
you know, people doing it much more high
[SPEAKER_02]: bar indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the kind of gold standard is,
you know, in the soil and under the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think from an ecological impact
perspective, growing outdoors in the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a challenge in certain
states, depending on environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, I think it's a very lofty and
very worthwhile goal and something to
[SPEAKER_01]: shoot for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this standard goes so far beyond
anything organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to sun and earth dot org,
you can read about it and I'll put links
[SPEAKER_01]: on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had long conversations with
Andrew Black, as I'm sure you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize how challenging putting
together a certification really was in my
[SPEAKER_01]: head.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started learning about it,
I was like, well, is it an organic input?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's so many other things to
consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really like navigating this gray
area almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as black and white when you're
trying to establish it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you have it, like in the
case with your certification, it becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: more black and white.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say this is OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But getting there, I can see all those
challenges in that path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, it's definitely not easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's important to bring the
various stakeholders together so everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: can hear everyone's experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then put the standard out for comment
and get more widespread feedback and just
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure it's both rigorous and workable
and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, Andrew's done a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'm looking forward to
interviewing him here soon to kind of dive
[SPEAKER_01]: into some of the more technical aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did want to ask you, so Brother
David's is sort of a brand, sort of under
[SPEAKER_01]: like a nonprofit, more of like a co-op.
[SPEAKER_01]: A co-op model, it sounds like,
from what I was reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are all the farms that are working with
Brother David's going to be Sun and Earth
[SPEAKER_01]: certified as part of being accepted into
that program?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're basically a not-for-profit brand
celebrating Sun and Earth farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a brand platform to kind of
celebrate the rock star farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the celebrities and the point of
the whole project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just generally want people to
really kind of think about the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: everything we produce or everything we
consume has been grown and produced
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere by some farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how was it produced?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was that farmer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was their farm labor respected or
exploited?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really connecting to the farm level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so we're exclusively working with
Sun and Earth certified farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so the idea is then that farms are
incentivized to join this program because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to have people backing them,
handling more of the marketing and those
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can focus then on the farming and
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from a consumer perspective,
will the product cost maybe a dollar or
[SPEAKER_01]: two more?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're getting all that reassurance in
your supporting the farms and ethics that
[SPEAKER_01]: may support your own personal ethics when
you're buying a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that sort of the idea behind that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it still depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Brother David's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pay a premium to our Sun and Earth
farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is going to be a marketing
budget for Sun and Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're just a farmer selling direct
to consumer, hopefully we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: create awareness such that you can command
a price premium.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally speaking, I think a lot of
what we're going to really target as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as getting that premium to farmers is we
want to see the brands at the brand level,
[SPEAKER_02]: certified as Sun and Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as part of that commitment,
they would then pay like a 10% premium or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever to farmers that they're sourcing
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who go through the effort to become Sun
and Earth certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not like mandated, but it's like
something that we're recommending that
[SPEAKER_02]: that be the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of like organic on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is a higher price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just about communicating to
consumers why they should pay that higher
[SPEAKER_02]: premium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to set about doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wouldn't say advice farmers like,
you know, we totally got it and you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to spend time like telling the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of need all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a, what do you say,
open source project.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all got to be talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of curious your opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys have managed to maintain your
ethics and integrity with Dr. Brauders and
[SPEAKER_01]: still lead the industry in your field with
natural soaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of wondering, how do you manage
to compete with these larger corporations
[SPEAKER_01]: that are making more money and spending
more on marketing, you know, using cheaper
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet you're still able to pay an
equitable wage and donate considerable
[SPEAKER_01]: considerable funds to the causes you
believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's parallels here in the
cannabis industry as some of these larger
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are moving in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any advice or anything you can
share around that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I think just being kind of
true to yourself and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the right thing, you know,
making sure you're paying your people
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, sourcing from the right
kind of farms and farmers and all that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, results in a somewhat higher
price point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you know, telling that,
you know, just being effective in telling
[SPEAKER_02]: that story and communicating that there's,
you know, a huge swath of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers who like organic shoppers for
food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they want to know where their
medicine comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to know it didn't suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think that there is a
real market there to tap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you know, I think, you know,
the big players, they, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to have a lot of a lot of
money in the campaigns and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, they generally aren't going
to have as much soul as a really kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller, more awesome, more nimble kind of
brand or company or farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, you know, just kind of
really connecting and that more soulful
[SPEAKER_02]: way with your customer base and them just
really appreciating what you're about is
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, really, you know,
not just producing the righteous product
[SPEAKER_02]: in the best way possible, but,
you know, the social generally vibrating
[SPEAKER_02]: in a way that's trying to make the world
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, definitely can
withstand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it's, you know, I don't want
to minimize how hard and difficult it is
[SPEAKER_02]: with all the players moving in and the
huge disruptions going on in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's part of what Sun and Earth is
about is really about helping,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the farms and small family
farmers, you know, really struggling in
[SPEAKER_02]: this kind of catastrophe really to
survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one of the tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, OK, how do we effectively
communicate to the consumers like Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bronner is connected with?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how do we give, you know,
what are the tools?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of what Sun and Earth is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, and I would just say that,
you know, we were small ones and that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then, you know, just making sure
you've got the.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, right margin structure to
support all that, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not too high a price point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big trick.
And.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess it's navigating the water
skillfully as you can and with a whole lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess that's how we did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm hearing is is have a good
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick to your guns and keep your ethics
and what you believe in and then make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell a story and tell your message
effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that sort of the some some of what
you're what you're getting out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then, yeah, and then I don't
know, maybe that you resonate in a cool
[SPEAKER_02]: way and you get some cool breaks to stay
in true to your guns in some ways that you
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but but yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much the the the recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your your advocacy for hemp and
cannabis goes back, you know, quite far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you were even arrested back in 2012
in front of the White House.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel the legalization process
has gone so far in a lot of these states?
[SPEAKER_01]: And where do you see it headed for
cultivators?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, actually, that's just you
pointed out something there is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, instead of a marketing budget,
like we've got kind of an activism budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like really good at leveraging
our activism to generate, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just win the cause that we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our main purpose and goal,
but also effectively gets us a lot of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, kind of media attention and,
you know, whatever social media and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think like spent,
you know, just being out there and
[SPEAKER_02]: fighting for causes that are, you know,
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most of all to ourselves,
but also to, you know, people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: buying our products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's, you know, just being in
there and really fighting the good fight
[SPEAKER_02]: is, you know, just helpful for building
building business in this kind of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that a lot of legalization
is, you know, it's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot who said it, but somebody said
once like you don't want to watch laws or
[SPEAKER_02]: sausage get made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a lot of these like,
you know, legalization efforts are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they're kind of driven by polls
like of, you know, okay, what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think, what do they think they're going to
get the 50 plus one with and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: concessions that they make and the kind of
over burdensome regulations that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what, you know, various
interests feel are necessary to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I definitely do appreciate the,
you know, kind of goal of any prohibition
[SPEAKER_02]: is first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think a lot of the
legalization efforts are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of less than ideal to far from ideal
as far as the regulatory burdens being
[SPEAKER_02]: placed on small farmers and businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, hopefully we can,
you know, clean things up legislatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, then just with like
market based programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Sun and Earth just try to,
you know, really help kind of what's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, clearly the big industrial
players are moving in and are able to
[SPEAKER_02]: navigate this super complex regulatory
environment, you know, much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, ideally we move to a
world where, you know, cannabis is just
[SPEAKER_02]: another crop and it's more or less
regulated and treated like one and not
[SPEAKER_02]: like nuclear waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see cannabis following a wine or
whiskey model or, well, do you think Big
[SPEAKER_01]: Egg is going to take over the industry
here with potentially with federal
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it's big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like wine, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have your what do you call
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Two buck chuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have the, you know, super commodity
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think very much cannabis
will follow the wine model and you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: have, you know, everybody who's producing
quality cannabis not everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, you know, I think people are really
producing like the top quality stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a smart job, you know, communicating
and marketing, you know, what they're up
[SPEAKER_02]: to and, you know, just connecting in a
soulful real way with their customers and
[SPEAKER_02]: getting a good name for themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just very much like you see with
the wine and, you know, micro winery to
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever scale winery model in California
and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's pretty much how cannabis
will go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be big players next in with
kind of smaller, smaller players.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't see federal legalization
having a dramatic impact on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like, for me, I had this
interesting discussion with some other
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are involved in cannabis
advocacy over on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my concern with federal legalization
is someone who, you know, makes potting
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and provides organic amendments and
things like that to growers is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Scott's or Dow or Bayer could
come in at any point with federal
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization and pretty much, you know,
wipe me off the face of the map in about
[SPEAKER_01]: five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't see my business model as
being something that has potential
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term success just because I don't
have the dollars and the PhDs and we're a
[SPEAKER_01]: small company to stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what your thoughts are on it,
on the, you know, on all of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it's an interesting subject to
talk about for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you say again, what's your
business focus?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a I have a seven acre like farm
and feed store that's organic in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, you know, we're big advocates for
growing your own food and regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm actually having to shut down the
farm due to some compliance code
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance issues with the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're just focusing now on our
gardening side of our business,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is providing organic amendments and
soils and things like that, organic soils
[SPEAKER_01]: to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that, you know, Scott's already
has a line called black magic that's
[SPEAKER_01]: available on Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, more and more companies are
focusing on organics and coming out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the big ag companies are
still holding off due to this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the federal regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just wondering if we're going to
get flooded at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if they're already doing
research and they're just ready to take
[SPEAKER_01]: over the moment, you know, someone else is
elected or the things go legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I mean, that's definitely a
concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I would say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of like you see with organic and
the point of like regenerative organic is
[SPEAKER_02]: that it kind of rewards and only,
you know, it's generally hard to be a sun
[SPEAKER_02]: and earth farmer or regenerative organic
farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're big, it's just it's pretty
management intensive style farming and.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, lends itself to smaller scale to
kind of handle the diverse crop rotations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, they're much more productive
farms by area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and just, you know,
much more knowledge intensive and
[SPEAKER_02]: management intensive versus chemical
intensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that, you know, that's part of
what we hope to do with Summoner,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, is, you know, create that market
space and consumer space.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is hard to do at a large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, you know, I mean,
for any given, I guess, input or
[SPEAKER_02]: commodity, you know, I guess it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess it depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, I can see how the big
players moving in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely a concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, hopefully, you know,
you can get a customer base.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just really appreciate the integrity and
soul that you're putting into making your
[SPEAKER_02]: amendments and, you know, whatever is
going into the Scots like magic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not nearly as awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and that's something,
I guess, for Senator to think about on the
[SPEAKER_02]: input side as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that kind of reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Senator, it is interesting to me
because there aren't a lot of inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming from off the farm, which I think is
is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's ultimately what we all aim
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Realizing that much of cannabis
cultivation is not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: qualify for Senator certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see another certification like I
know certified kind already exist and is a
[SPEAKER_01]: great program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you see other certifications
showing up down the road?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the Washington State Department of
Ag has talked about having an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: certification and they're working on one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What what could we have for indoor
growers, for example, or other forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's all about incremental
progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to say that the perfect
should be the enemy of the good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think there's definitely a
room for certification at different
[SPEAKER_02]: levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I ideally are like an on ramp to
Senator eventually as farmers kind of get
[SPEAKER_02]: off chemical inputs and start generating
more on farm fertility and.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just get into that rhythm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think definitely a spectrum makes
sense and is going to be the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think there's a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, chemical or synthetic growers
will switch over to this type of
[SPEAKER_01]: certification, because the way I saw this
is like this this certification is so far
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond even just organic certification,
the people that we're going to the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers, at least that would be interested
to be the ones that are already like
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty passionate about regenerative
agriculture or at least have some working
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge, because the amount of knowledge
involved to to meet the standard is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: high, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the jumping off point to some of
this is organic, not not conventional
[SPEAKER_02]: farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would say convention would need
to go organic and just kind of learn I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean, it's a big thing to go off chemicals
and manage pest and meat pressure and
[SPEAKER_02]: fertility without synthetic inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think most conventional
growers are in a position to go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: seminar, but I think if we're successful
at the program, like the USC Organic
[SPEAKER_02]: Program, we create consumer demand that
will create the incentive for many farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: who are maybe organic, but not quite to
some extent, to go ahead and up their game
[SPEAKER_02]: to that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess even conventional farmers,
there's things like integrated pest
[SPEAKER_02]: management and different regenerative ag
techniques that are not necessarily in the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic program, but are farming in a
relatively more ecological way versus like
[SPEAKER_02]: the complete disaster, monoculture,
GMO deserts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, I think it's definitely a
high bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not everybody is ready to
merely submit it, but we do want to
[SPEAKER_02]: recognize everybody who is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We right now don't have that kind of
market distinction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to give them that recognition and
consumer facing recognition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your philosophy is really to meet
growers wherever they're at in the
[SPEAKER_01]: journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can just send them a little
closer, a little further down the path
[SPEAKER_01]: towards helping the environment and being
a little more ecologically conscious,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this really isn't intended to be
exclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of an inclusive process,
it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the regenerative organic standard,
we've got a bronze, silver, gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're entertaining a tiered
system if that's not already the case in
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, I think I definitely
want to, you know, and then there's
[SPEAKER_02]: incremental steps all along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said it well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about like wherever you are,
you know, just begin that journey towards,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, regenerative organic kind of
holy grail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the idea of the grand vision is
like if all of us take responsibility,
[SPEAKER_02]: as consumers, and we see our plates as
farms and our knives, as butchery knives
[SPEAKER_02]: and our forks as pitchforks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we, you know, what does our
section of the garden look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is, what kind of farm, what does that
land, what does the farmers' land look
[SPEAKER_02]: like?
[SPEAKER_02]: As workers, you know, is he able to take
care of his land in a regenerative way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is he just, you know, is it just like a
blasted industrial landscape that's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, wrecking the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one third of the earth's surface
is under industrial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other half is under natural
mismanagement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can shift that to regenerative
organic and, you know, farming nature's
[SPEAKER_02]: image and our farming ecosystems are
replicating natural ones in important
[SPEAKER_02]: functional ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most importantly, good for
biodiversity habitat, wildlife habitat,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing nutritious, nutrient-dense food
and medicine and clothes and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the consumer side, you know,
creating the demand and then on the farmer
[SPEAKER_02]: side, like putting forward the
certification program and then training
[SPEAKER_02]: programs also is really important to just
help us get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're speaking my language.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so great to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate the work you guys
are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of an unrelated question,
just out of curiosity to kind of end the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you mentioned you had some time
over in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: You started, you know, consuming cannabis
in college.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure at some point in time,
you've had conventional versus organic and
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a variety of different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a favorite cultivar out of
curiosity?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then can you tell a difference
smoking, you know, organically versus
[SPEAKER_01]: conventionally grown cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, well, I mean, I've been, I guess back
in, you know, I had like not any real
[SPEAKER_02]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my experience in like the mid-90s
was when the dead growth of talent,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, podcast just saw a whole other
dimension of awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like ridiculous, you know,
versus like kind of messy swag that was
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of all around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, in Amsterdam is, you know,
I didn't really, you know, I wasn't yet
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of vibrating on that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until later, you know,
I guess, you know, now I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: I generally just don't really smoke,
I guess much that isn't outdoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, sun grown organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my favorite strain, I would say
the, I mean, I'm really digging Water
[SPEAKER_02]: Dogs, Herb Farm, The Phoenix Rising,
pretty, pretty, pretty amazing Sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also like the Lemonhead, it's a kind of a
lemony Rolls-Royce, Rolls-Trois coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: of Urbanology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of our senators certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these are all senators certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I like the Sativas generally
speaking, but also really Harmony Rose
[SPEAKER_02]: from, oh, the Louisiana Fields or no,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm blanking on the farmer, but that's
Harmony Rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the lady, she's actually cultivated a
lot of high CBD cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of really dialing in on the
vibration of the high, having no ideas
[SPEAKER_02]: underlying cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, Harmony Rose is from,
oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I guess, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, if you did a blind taste test
on me, I don't know if I'm like that
[SPEAKER_02]: sophisticated, but I can really pull it
apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess vibrationally, I just like
knowing, you know, same thing with an
[SPEAKER_02]: apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess you could, you might fool
me to the conventional versus organic
[SPEAKER_02]: apple or something, but you know,
I think just vibrationally, just really
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing that my medicine or my,
this apple came from a farm that was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, doing everything right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is like a great place to work and
live and whether you're a farmer or the
[SPEAKER_02]: farm dog or cow or the, you know,
bugs that it's all, or well, not the
[SPEAKER_02]: certain kind of bugs, not the wrong kind
of bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a pretty good place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I get that, you know,
just more of that knowledge is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, the experience is also
crucial and that's something you really
[SPEAKER_02]: want to emphasize.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun on earth is that these are some of
the top quality flowers, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: top, top, top shelf flowers that anybody's
producing and doing it in a totally
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're also setting, I think that's a
good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're also setting a standard in terms
of the flower itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not just saying because you grew in
this method, if it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: poor quality, it's not going to go under
the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to be putting that out
there at least with brother David's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still going to be a premium flower
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to the question you earlier,
like, you know, how they succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, number one and foremost is your
product quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've brought Dr. Bronner's, you know,
peppermint soap, that quality started
[SPEAKER_02]: going sideways and people weren't getting
that awesome tingle, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful lather, you know, that
experience like every time, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the other awesome things we're doing
is like not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, just definitely quality is
the number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, all the other things are,
you know, equal or, you know, just also
[SPEAKER_02]: super important and we're not going to
compromise, but, you know, the quality's
[SPEAKER_02]: just got to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so grateful for your time today and
for your company and as someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: having our first child here in about three
weeks, I'm grateful to have access to
[SPEAKER_01]: products like, you know, your baby soap so
that I know that when I'm, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: exposing my child to while there's a lot
of toxins in the environment, that's one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that I can check off the list and be
less concerned about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for all the good work you do and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate your time today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me and
congratulations with your new baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that your first or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is our first child.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're three weeks out and we're
pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everything's going to change,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super congratulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big love to your wife and new baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was David Bronner, CEO of Dr.
Bronner's Natural Soaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned next week for my interview with
Andrew Black on the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: certification and what considerations go
into creating one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon after that, though, I'll be diving
back into the science side of cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: with some university research on cannabis
to present from the University of Guelph
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to the Cannabis
Cultivation and Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to check out our website at
www.kisorganics.com for more information
[SPEAKER_01]: and resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening.
Mm hmm.
