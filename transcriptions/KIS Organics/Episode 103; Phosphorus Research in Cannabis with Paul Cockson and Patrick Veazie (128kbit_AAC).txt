[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Cannabis Cultivation and
Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Tad Hussie of Kiss
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the podcast where we discuss the
cutting edge of growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their wisdom and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guests this week are two awesome
cannabis researchers, Paul Coxon and
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrick Veazey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul has been on the podcast before on
episode 59, talking about his paper on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to check out that episode if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, this is a good one to go to the
podcast page at kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click on the Learn tab, then Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have links to all the papers so you
can follow along as well as a link to
[SPEAKER_00]: their new website that shares all their
research in one central location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul has been working in the hemp world as
a researcher since 2018 and in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: science research since 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a background in horticulture,
agroecology, and floriculture from his
[SPEAKER_00]: time at NC State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, he's pursuing his PhD at the
University of Kentucky while working with
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul's primary research focuses on
rhizosphere management and brings
[SPEAKER_00]: strengths in plant mineral fertility,
plant hormones and growth regulators,
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate research, general diagnostics,
and greenhouse and growth chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to his strong greenhouse
background, Paul is also literate in
[SPEAKER_00]: field-level agronomic processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul's passion is for mentorship and
sharing the research process with
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate students.
[SPEAKER_00]: When not doing research, Paul and his dog
Groot can be found hiking in local,
[SPEAKER_00]: state, and national parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrick Veazey has been working in the
hemp world as a researcher since 2019 and
[SPEAKER_00]: as a plant science researcher since 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a background in horticulture and
floriculture from his time as an
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate researcher at NC State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, he is pursuing his master of
science at North Carolina State and is
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on greenhouse substrates for
cannabis and other floriculture crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrick's primary research focuses on
plant mineral fertility, substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: research, and general diagnostics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super excited to talk to them about
their latest published research on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Patrick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, great to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much, Tad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's go ahead and start with Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've been on the podcast before,
but can you tell listeners just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Paul Coxson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, I am at the University of
Kentucky working on my PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working with the hemp agronomy team
here under the direction of Dr. Bob
[SPEAKER_02]: Pierce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the work that we're going to
talk about today was actually done at NC
[SPEAKER_02]: State.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Patrick was heavily involved,
if not one of the driving forces behind
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much all this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was completed, like I said,
at NC State under the direction of Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Whitker, who does plant nutrition
work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Patrick, can you tell us a little
about yourself as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I am Patrick Beasey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a master's student at NC State under
the advice of Dr. Brian Whitker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I currently focus on substrates and
perlite replacements for cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: other floriculture crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of this work was completed while I
was an undergrad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're still working with cannabis
heavily at NC State under Dr. Brian
[SPEAKER_01]: Whitker's program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a great program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the research that you guys have
already put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that aren't aware, Paul's
already been on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put out an excellent paper that we've
talked about on the podcast called The
[SPEAKER_00]: Characterization of Nutrient Disorders of
Cannabis Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly suggest checking that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Paul, can you tell us a little bit
about the phosphorus paper that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to discuss and why that was an area
of inquiry that you decided to pursue with
[SPEAKER_00]: your research?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to kind of begin with, you kind of have
to go back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been working in hemp with Brian
Whitker for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we first started, we really
didn't have a lot of scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: foundations for nutrition work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there weren't really tissue standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: There weren't really externally verified,
replicated fertility work that had been
[SPEAKER_02]: done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so kind of our journey through hemp,
we actually first paper that we put out
[SPEAKER_02]: was a general survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to a larger operation and we
surveyed quite a few cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took leaf tissue, did a survey,
got some general upper and lower ranges,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we published that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that, we kind of had a good idea
of what an adequate fertility regime might
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we kind of springboarded from that
into the nutrient deficiency work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to really categorize those
visual symptoms and marry them with the
[SPEAKER_02]: critical leaf tissue values.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one interesting thing we saw out of
that study was the phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came screaming in very early and the
tissue values were extremely low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started looking at some of the
popular press stuff out of there and
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were kind of shocked at how high
some of the early phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations in hemp and cannabis were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we decided to do kind of a rate
study, which was the first paper that
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll talk about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had phosphorus fertility rates
ranging from 3.75 to 30 parts per million
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of explored that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once we kind of finished that up,
Patrick got really excited about the upper
[SPEAKER_02]: ranges and wanted to see what would happen
at those higher concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then his work kind of married into that
line of inquiry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he tested the upper ranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of the background of this
study.
[SPEAKER_02]: This paper and how it all got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the title of the paper we're going to
discuss first is called Impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus on Cannabis Sativa,
Reproduction, Cannabinoids, and Turpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul is the lead author on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was published in September of,
November of 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into that though,
can you talk a little bit about phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: in relation to plant growth, plant health,
and maybe even more specifically with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and what you found from your
original work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, phosphorus was an easy low
hanging fruit early on just because the
[SPEAKER_02]: massive amounts that were being
recommended to some growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so physiologically speaking,
phosphorus is really important in floral
[SPEAKER_02]: development in a lot of crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an immobile element.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so essentially what that means is that
it will, or I'm sorry, a mobile element.
[SPEAKER_02]: I misspoke there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will come in pretty early on and
the plants will be pretty stunted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have this olive green spotting on
the lower and older leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that will progress up the plant
and eventually you'll get some defoliation
[SPEAKER_02]: and like I said, an overall stunting of
biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with its impacts on floral development
and then also that kind of stunting was
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of our early interest in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of segued into some of the
rates that we chose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you, so you saw in
popular literature around cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of very high application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was your initial hypothesis that maybe
we were in general over applying
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus as an industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that sort of where you started?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look across the board at,
you know, say the floor culture in general
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything, you're very rarely going
to see phosphorus concentrations as high
[SPEAKER_02]: as were being recommended.
[SPEAKER_02]: And furthermore, if you over apply
phosphorus, you can get some pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: pronounced antagonisms and lock out some
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was a little surprised that some
people hadn't experienced more issues with
[SPEAKER_02]: the extremely high concentrations that we
were seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd add too that we're also dealing
with phosphorus shortages and over
[SPEAKER_00]: application of phosphorus leads to algal
blooms and other environmental issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely some sustainability
challenges around, you know, the over
[SPEAKER_00]: application of P. So I think it's great if
we can figure out what's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's optimal for for this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take me through your, I guess,
take me through this paper, take me
[SPEAKER_00]: through your research then and what you
guys found.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing I would like to do is
just acknowledge all the people that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually worked on this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned earlier that Dr. Whipper's
program produces a lot of great research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, that's really because of who
he is as a person, how he runs his team,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then kind of the team mentality and
group support that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to definitely recommend that,
you know, you all take into account that
[SPEAKER_02]: this was not just, you know, a one person
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was truly a lab effort and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, we, we wanted to kind of
explore the lower end of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So typically, when you're looking
nutrients, you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: your deficiency level, and then you kind
of have this linear increase for your
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point, it's going to plateau
on the upper end for both, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass production, but then also the
accumulation of that nutrient in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you get too high, you'll actually
see a growth decrease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that just from the literature
that will kind of have this, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: plateau and then decreasing type
relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were more focused on the
beginning portion of that curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we chose lower phosphorus
concentrations, and our rates were
[SPEAKER_02]: informed from our previous work in our
surveys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from our survey, we knew that,
you know, in leaf tissue, across,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a couple cultivars, you're going
to see, you know, 0.26 to 0.43% phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that work comes out of Jen Kowalski,
which is another paper that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: published in 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can provide that link to you,
Tad, if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started at 3.75 parts per million,
and we went up to 30 parts per million
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our rates were 3.75, 7.5, 11.25,
15, 22.5, and 30 parts per million
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those were our six concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to take the plants from the
very beginning of their life cycle all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way to full bud maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's 16 weeks, eight weeks vegetative,
and then another eight weeks reproductive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to just kind of track how
the plants developed over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end, analyze the buds and
see what impacts cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, if there were any, that these
phosphorus concentrations had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of a general overview of
the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of quick questions I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this paper is based all on one specific
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question I'm going to have right
away is, how much variability do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll get across cultivars as we look at
all the genetic diversity in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anyone looked at that yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that a lot of people ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, I mentioned that paper
from Jen Kowalski.
[SPEAKER_02]: She looked at Bayox, Cherry 2.0,
Cherry Citrus, Cherry Cross, Cherry Wine,
[SPEAKER_02]: Early Pearly, Electra, Endurance,
Midwest, Stout, Sever Hayes, and
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweetened, as well as a Cherry Cross by
Cherry Wine Frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she categorized each and every
individual one of those and looked at the
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus concentrations in the leaf
tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oddly enough, we saw some differences,
some very significant differences,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they all kind of fell within this
general range of 0.26% to 0.43% phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the driving force.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason we chose Bayox for this
study was because that was a high
[SPEAKER_02]: performer, a very consistent genetic,
consistent phenotype for us in our
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, you are right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different environmental factors,
abiotic factors, agricultural factors,
[SPEAKER_02]: and genetic factors will impact this
slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the methodology of your paper
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you guys did a really good job
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question I have then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these varying P concentrations,
they were supplied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just take the 3.75 ppm
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You applied that every single irrigation
all the way through from vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: through flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same concentration the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Constant liquid feed of that fertilizer
concentration throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no bumping up or bumping down or
boosting during flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that comes from some
preliminary work that we did looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: comparing constant liquid feed versus
variable feed that we're still sifting
[SPEAKER_02]: through the data on.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess take me a little through
some of the things that you measured in
[SPEAKER_00]: your study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can talk a little about some
of your results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So early on in the vegetative stage,
four weeks in, we took some height and
[SPEAKER_02]: diameter measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just kind of looking at a general
stature of the plants and how they may be
[SPEAKER_02]: growing over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And irregardless of that, irregardless of
phosphorus concentration, we actually saw
[SPEAKER_02]: no statistical differences between either
height or plant diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And diameter is just the average of two
widths.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was kind of surprising to see given
our early nutrient deficiency work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of surmise that some of that may
have to do with just the overall cultural
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions growing in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have a little bit of phosphorus in
our water from the test values that we
[SPEAKER_02]: ran.
[SPEAKER_02]: But four weeks in, we didn't see much of a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had expected to see a little bit
more of a pronounced deficiency at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point in time or stunting on the lowest
concentration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four weeks, not a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened as you move forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any other key metrics that you
wanted to touch on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So early on, like I said, we were just
kind of tracking biomass production,
[SPEAKER_02]: plant height, plant diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you kind of fast forward to eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where you really started seeing
the statistical differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this is still vegetative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did see this kind of variable
response in plant height and diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, plant that were
sitting right at about 11 and a quarter
[SPEAKER_02]: parts per million phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Above that concentration, they were all
statistically similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were, again, kind of surprised
that that was a lower concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw the same for total above ground
biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So half of the plants in this study,
we destructively harvested at that eight
[SPEAKER_02]: week vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the remainder of the half we took out
to the full 16 weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did you find then at the full 16
weeks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a nice figure in the paper
that kind of categorizes the lack of
[SPEAKER_02]: differences that we were seeing at that 11
and a quarter parts per million phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't encourage you all to be
looking along in the paper while I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: talking here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But essentially, once we got to the,
actually, I'm going to back up a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm actually going to talk about the
leaf tissue, because we did take leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue concentrations at eight weeks.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one interesting thing that we saw,
so early on, very little difference that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're seeing in those phosphorus
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get to that eight week mark,
we're seeing some differences there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but at a much lower concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was personally expecting something
around 30 parts per million to be adequate
[SPEAKER_02]: for hemp that we trialed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing that was interesting is that
when you actually looked at the leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue, so after eight weeks under the
leaf tissue, most recently matured leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: you saw that as we increased the
phosphorus concentration, we did not see
[SPEAKER_02]: an upper response or a plateau response
like we saw in the plant biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant was just sucking up the
phosphorus and allocating it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't see an upper concentration
there, even at our highest concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was a really interesting find,
because it kind of maybe points to the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that cannabis may be really good at
sequestering that phosphorus and actually
[SPEAKER_02]: storing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that may be a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be kind of a factor that could help
explain why, even at these extremely high
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus concentrations that we were
seeing recommended, we weren't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing any of these phosphorus toxicities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking at the graph here,
and we'll have links to these papers so
[SPEAKER_00]: people can follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on table two here, and it looks like
you saw statistically a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in height and diameter and above
ground dry weight, but not below ground
[SPEAKER_00]: dry weight or root to shoot ratio across
all concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that significance in height and
weight started at 11.25 ppm all the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 and was essentially there wasn't a lot
of significance within that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I state that correctly?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, above 11.25 ppm,
you're going to receive the same height
[SPEAKER_02]: and the same diameter and the same above
ground dry weight or biomass, even if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're applying more phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I had always associated phosphorus
with root growth and root health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that not something that you saw in this
study in terms of there being any
[SPEAKER_00]: significance at different concentrations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have a role, a large part,
in root development, rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: management, branching, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a little bit surprising to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in this study, just looking at the
root balls, so when we were terminating,
[SPEAKER_02]: we kind of broke apart a few root balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it more had to do with the fact
that the rhizosphere volume was actually a
[SPEAKER_02]: little more limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe if those would have been
larger pots or even some maybe like coir
[SPEAKER_02]: blocks, we could have maybe seen that
those differences come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you think that one of the
limitations might have been just overall
[SPEAKER_00]: root space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, because I'm looking at your
photo of these plants and they're not the
[SPEAKER_00]: most robust plants I've seen ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a nice way to put that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look just visually, to me,
maybe a little bit nitrogen deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you think of the overall plant
health in relation to this experiment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that would be my first question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we saw the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're very correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we, as scientists, we're really
good at running experiments, but sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: our plants may not be the most beautiful
when it comes to that aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we actually looked at all of our
macro and micronutrients, we were still
[SPEAKER_02]: within our survey ranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while the plants may not look the most
overly robust and green and dark foliage,
[SPEAKER_02]: the tissue values are still within a
healthy range.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving forward from eight weeks,
I would assume you would start to see more
[SPEAKER_00]: more drastic spread in terms of plant
expression and plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened at that point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so again, we sampled at about 12
weeks looking at plant height and
[SPEAKER_02]: diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there we did start seeing more of a
trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw the highest height at a higher
concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So twenty two and a half to thirty parts
per million, as well as diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once they go into that reproductive
phase and start reallocating nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: from maybe older leaves into developing
sinks, which are going to be your flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: we did start seeing more differences
there, which, again, was a little
[SPEAKER_02]: surprising, you know, given how quickly
the nutrient deficiency came in from the
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency study.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at 12 weeks, we started really seeing
that value of those higher fertility
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one thing that's common in the
industry is to have these PK boosters
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're applying high phosphorus,
high potassium in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does how is that reflective upon your
study in terms of what your findings were?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do you feel that that phosphorus is
potentially beneficial or do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe the potassium is providing some
more of the benefit that people are seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: from these applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, what are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a that's a really
controversial question there, because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of people on both sides that
have very strong opinions on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to speak more from like a
plant physiology standpoint on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, what you see in most crops is
that there will be this kind of lag phase
[SPEAKER_02]: behind the endogenous production of the
reproductive phase versus the vegetative
[SPEAKER_02]: phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the time, what you're seeing
is that the nutrients that that plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: taking up in the vegetative stage,
a good portion of those will get
[SPEAKER_02]: reallocated into that developing sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you will have this light overlap
between where it's switching from
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative to reproductive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what a lot of people are
seeing in the industry could be that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of lag and overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different crops will have a different kind
of lag phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think that we kind of saw
that some here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know necessarily if it's going to
be the potassium or the phosphorus that's
[SPEAKER_02]: giving that benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, I'm going to answer that
question more from a plant physiology
[SPEAKER_02]: standpoint and kind of say that,
you know, it's not just this complete
[SPEAKER_02]: switch where once they go reproductive,
they're not going to take up any more
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as plants switch from a vegetative
stage to a flowery stage as they're
[SPEAKER_00]: completing their lifecycle, they are still
taking up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ratio of those nutrients,
I assume, changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying that there's a lag
between as they make that switch in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of what nutrients are most needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're kind of getting at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, it's when a plant switches
from a vegetative stage to a reproductive
[SPEAKER_02]: stage, it's not going to be an automatic
on off switch where they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately stop taking up any phosphorus,
any potassium, any magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're going to continue taking
up those nutrients as they're
[SPEAKER_02]: transitioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually, they'll start slowing down
on that uptake, at least from a from a
[SPEAKER_02]: common physiology understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can kind of see that in other
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: As they start dropping leaves and they
start senescing and ending their life,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the plants just going to at some
point stop taking up those nutrients as
[SPEAKER_02]: much as it would in, say, a vegetative
stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to start heavily
reallocating what it's already taken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, that is a contentious
subject in the industry in terms of what
[SPEAKER_00]: an optimal harvestable plant looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really like that senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colors and knowing that there's not as
much chlorophyll in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other people will say you can really
increase your your weights at harvest by
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing the plant harder and maybe having
what, you know, looks like less of a
[SPEAKER_00]: finished plant, I guess, at harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe higher levels of nutrients in that
plant tissue are accessible to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in the media prior to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see more research on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at uptake, partitioning and
reallocation in industrial hemp would
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely be the next kind of iteration
of this level of inquiry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been something that I've wanted to
do for a very long time, just given the
the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Current state of understanding and
knowledge that exists within the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure for both of you,
there's a million experiments that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have in your head that you would love to
you would love to get around to at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's let's get back to your paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I kind of went off topic there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were we were we at 12 weeks right now,
or were you up to 16 weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you like to continue on from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can we can kind of go to the BUD
results and kind of the cannabis steroid
[SPEAKER_02]: and terpene results if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once once we finished the experiment,
again, we took height with biomass and we
[SPEAKER_02]: took fresh bud weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I will say about that is a lot
of the BUD material we were analyzing a
[SPEAKER_02]: composite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were looking at the terminal BUD,
an axillary shoot terminal BUD and then a
[SPEAKER_02]: BUD from the interior of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were kind of limited in taking our
dry mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why we took fresh weight on
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say I wouldn't lean too heavily
on the BUD fresh weight, just given the
[SPEAKER_02]: natural variability that's going to exist
plant to plant in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, we did a composite
sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, did you have something to add?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, since you paused, I was just
going to ask if you did any any trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: on these plants or pruning during the
flower cycle or not, or if you just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of let them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just one question I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the for the purpose of this
experiment, we did not do any trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just kind of as they were throughout
the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason we decided to do that is we
didn't want to potentially interfere with
[SPEAKER_02]: removing biomass that could still have
some phosphorus resources that could be
[SPEAKER_02]: allocated to the BUD or those developing
reproductive leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then, like I said, we looked at the
different cannabinoids and then some
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the results were kind of surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, after that eight weeks of
vegetative growth or sorry, reproductive
[SPEAKER_02]: growth, we really saw, again, this kind of
plateau at about 15 parts per million
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you look at your Delta 9 THC,
you know, and then if you also kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: looked at CBD and CBC, those had a plateau
at around that 11 and a quarter parts per
[SPEAKER_02]: million.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 11 and a quarter to 15 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Above that concentration, we really didn't
see an increase in those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, kind of mirroring what we saw
early on at that kind of plateau range in
[SPEAKER_02]: the lower phosphorus concentrations that
we studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's much lower than I would have
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was very surprising for us,
too, which is part of the reason we were
[SPEAKER_02]: really excited to publish this and tried
to get it out pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing I will mention on this in
the paper, these are listed as milligrams
[SPEAKER_02]: per gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're looking at those tables,
don't assume that that's a percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we when we looked at the actual
like active pools, so everyone's pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with kind of the acid pools
versus the active pools there in the
[SPEAKER_02]: paper, we broke those up and we analyzed
them separately because we wanted to see,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so if you are under a state that is
going to regulate off of Delta nine versus
[SPEAKER_02]: total THC and then looking at what's in
your acid pool and what's in your
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylated pool, we kind of separated
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you look at the acid pool,
the acid pools, which is where most of
[SPEAKER_02]: your cannabinoids are going to come from
when they get decarboxylated there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we saw a very pronounced plateau at
that 11 and a quarter parts per million
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus for CBDA, THCA, total THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Total CBD and total cannabinoids when you
kind of sum them all together and then
[SPEAKER_02]: divide by the total cannabinoids analyzed,
which was, again, pretty surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times in science you don't see
something that cut and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was this was a pretty strong
trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost like a bell curve, like a kind
of with three point seven five on one side
[SPEAKER_00]: and thirty on the other kind of peaks at
the eleven point two five range for almost
[SPEAKER_00]: all your cannabinoids slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's more of a roller coaster going
up to the top and then just coming down a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, more like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of kind of the first half of like
a bell curve or a horseshoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you're coming up,
you're coming up, you're coming up and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you level off kind of at that bend
and then you kind of stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, was that statistically significant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't say it between the eleven point
two five treatment and the thirty parts
[SPEAKER_00]: per million treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference you saw there,
because I see that your total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, for example, are higher at
eleven point two five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your total THC is higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that considered significant,
though?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was not statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of the reason there is if you
look at the standard deviations,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had some quite a bit of variability,
a little bit more than I was hoping for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's important when when looking at
any type of graph or figure to look at how
[SPEAKER_02]: much the data is varying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our standard deviations were a bit
higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you are correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Between eleven point two five and thirty
parts per million, even though the means
[SPEAKER_02]: were higher at eleven point two five
compared to the thirty, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were not they were statistically
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if we were just going off this
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this table, we could confidently say
that eleven point two five ppm is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce better cannabinoids than three
point seven five.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't confidently say that thirty
ppm is necessarily worse than eleven point
[SPEAKER_00]: two five, other than the fact you may be
over applying phosphorus based on these
[SPEAKER_00]: charts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's it's kind of hard to make
sweeping generalizations in the sciences
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone's pretty pretty well
aware that based on, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: your vapor pressure deficit, what type of
lights you're running, what temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going for, you know, are you using
kind of a living bed or are you working in
[SPEAKER_02]: an inert media?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all of all of these
recommendations will change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, when you add into that,
you know, the slight cultivar differences
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're seeing, it makes it really
difficult to make an absolute all
[SPEAKER_02]: encompassing definitive statement on this
is unequivocally the best phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing I always recommend is,
you know, this is what the data is saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the paper, we kind of
give a general range, but to always make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure you're correlating that back to leaf
tissue values, because if you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: focusing on what you're applying,
once it goes into your system,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, microbes may use some of it if
you're mending with microbes and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that may decrease the available
phosphorus to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your leaf tissue is always a good go
to because it tells you how much
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus the plant is actually getting,
which is, again, why we started with the
[SPEAKER_02]: survey ranges, you know, because if you're
in a highly organic system and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: amending with a lot of bone meal,
it takes time for that to break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a cost as that
phosphorus goes to the microbes and then
[SPEAKER_02]: gets, you know, mineralized by the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you really want to fine tune your
own specific operation by checking your
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to imply to listeners that
this study is at all definitive about
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal phosphorus levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that there's still a lot of research
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the trend that it points
to is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it would give people a
starting point for where to consider,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, starting a trial or experiment
in their own in their own garden or our
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's way more research that needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other scientists, other cultivars need to
be studied.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can only all get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Together as more and more data comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, kind of going back to the
next table in the paper where we looked at
[SPEAKER_02]: the terpenes pretty much across the board,
we saw a lot of variability and not a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of statistical significance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we were we were somewhat
hoping that we could kind of correlate
[SPEAKER_02]: these mineral nutrients going into the
system and potentially see an impact
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, the only one that we saw an
impact in was I'm going to butcher this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's geranol or geranol.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember off the top of my head
how to pronounce that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one, we actually saw lower
concentrations above the eleven point two
[SPEAKER_02]: five parts per million for that particular
terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you have expected phosphorus to play
a bigger role in terpene expression based
[SPEAKER_00]: on what you know of the of how the plant
utilizes phosphorus as a mineral?
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as like upstream effects in the
physiology, you know, your phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_02]: your sulfur, your nitrogen, they're going
to play kind of a role in most enzymatic
[SPEAKER_02]: processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were potentially thinking that
there could be some downstream effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was a loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a long shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you miss 100 percent of the
shots you don't take.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to try and throw in this data
set to see if we could kind of quantify
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe some far downstream effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, I think it's great that you guys
took that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really interesting that you
didn't see a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I would have
hypothesized, but yeah, that's very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you guys did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little about your about
the discussion part of your paper and sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of what some of your your conclusions were
around around this this trial?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, when I look at this,
the the story is kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Complicated, you know, a lot of times it's
it's easy to sit down and give kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: straightforward story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, we want everything to be
cut and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, the the results of this paper
that we go through in the discussion,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of like we really want growers
to take this data and apply it to their
[SPEAKER_02]: own operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if you're going for clones,
you may have a different phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation than if you're trying to
produce biomass for, say, a distillate
[SPEAKER_02]: market versus, you know, quality bud
that's going to be sold to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a distillery for, you know,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking that that fresh bud, so where your
aesthetic is a lot more important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, the best thing that I can I can
comment on for the discussion is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, our our leaf tissue values for
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were within the previously reported
values from Bryson and Mills, which was
[SPEAKER_02]: encouraging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we compare that to some early
work that we did with Hunter Landis and
[SPEAKER_02]: the survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like I said, I mentioned the
newer paper with Jen Kowalski.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, early on, we talk about how
plant height and width weren't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: all that statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But later on, you know, we did see those
increases.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a very, very cursory summary of
the discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like, I mean, because you
applied the same rate of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire life of the plant,
would you just speculate that there may be
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages to applying phosphorus at
different concentrations at different
[SPEAKER_00]: plant stages from a from a grower
perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, obviously, if you have a
developing seedling, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: want to dump on, you know, kind of a
nutrient regimen for like a full grown
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the time, you know,
there will be variability within your
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient program.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as correlating that to specific
stages, at this point, I really do think
[SPEAKER_02]: that we we need quite a bit more research,
you know, going into that, because a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of this research here is not necessarily a
one to one comparison for most growers
[SPEAKER_02]: because they are on that variable regimen
model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, one of the things we
have to do in science is kind of go back
[SPEAKER_02]: to kind of the least common denominator
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to kind of eliminate that
variability from the phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we apply that phosphorus at a constant
rate so that we don't get any confounding
[SPEAKER_02]: effects from a variable rate of phosphorus
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would love to see this work continue
and then actually testing different
[SPEAKER_02]: regiments and different timings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that I don't know if that
directly answers your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's challenging for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the on the industry side,
most growers don't have access to leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're relying on visual symptoms and
which can be very challenging because
[SPEAKER_00]: there can be confounding variables,
as you know, when it comes to deficiencies
[SPEAKER_00]: or toxicities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those can relate to watering
and environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can get very confusing or we're
required to use soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of what the work that I'm doing
is using soil testing in soilless organic
[SPEAKER_00]: media, looking at like a malic three and a
saturated paste test and then making
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we're talking about
specifically with phosphorus availability,
[SPEAKER_00]: we look at the paste test and see how much
is in solution and then make estimations
[SPEAKER_00]: off of that as to how much phosphorus is
going to become available throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets even more complicated because
we have microbes processing all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments, like you mentioned with bone
meal or other pea sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes very, very challenging to know
exactly how much phosphorus the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting at any given stage of growth or
any particular date in its growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does make it really challenging and
it's kind of one of those things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: cringe every single time I have to say it
because I feel like I just constantly am
[SPEAKER_02]: advocating for nutrient, sorry,
leaf tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, it's not either
acceptable to the industry or it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: not common at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a few other works out there
that I've seen potentially correlating
[SPEAKER_02]: spectral imaging to nutrient concentration
or even looking at, say, like a pore
[SPEAKER_02]: through method or some sort of a leachate
analysis where you know what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: putting into the system and then you can
check what's coming out at the other end,
[SPEAKER_02]: either at the draining from the pot or
from your slab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then trying to extrapolate back out to
that what may be taken out by the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, like you mentioned,
it gets complicated because you also have
[SPEAKER_02]: the microbes in there, potentially algae.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's definitely more research
needed to try and potentially find a quick
[SPEAKER_02]: and dirty method for the industry so that
we don't have to rely on these costly
[SPEAKER_02]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and like you mentioned, affordable
too, because that's a big issue for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of growers right now, especially in the
current state of where our industry is at
[SPEAKER_00]: nationally, which I'm really curious to
hear as we move on to Patrick's work,
[SPEAKER_00]: because one thing that we found in our
testing and just correlating the data that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting off of soil tests with plant
health and yields in the facilities that
[SPEAKER_00]: we work with is that we can apply
significantly lower levels of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: and even have lower, like one of the best
performing facilities I work with has
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently low available phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, if you look at their bud and dry
weight, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always leaned towards lower P
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really curious to hear,
Patrick, what you have to say in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the research that you did, if we can move
on to your paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that sound?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did want to make a comment on the
variable versus continuous phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it also really stems back to your
production practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, we were not pruning, nor we were
defoliating the plant, because phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: is stored in those lower leaves and it's
mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the plant needs it, it has the
ability to move them up to those sinks,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would be your developing buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things is that if you are
not pruning and you're not defoliating,
[SPEAKER_01]: you actually kind of have a small storage
unit in those lower leaves that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's able to move up to where the buds
are developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may not need to boost later in the
production cycle as you're having buds
[SPEAKER_01]: set.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if your grower is pruning or
defoliating, you are removing those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients off the plant that could have
potentially been mobile to go to that new
[SPEAKER_01]: sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think with us using a continuous rate
and not pruning, we were able to use those
[SPEAKER_01]: mobile nutrients that were stored so that
growers should also evaluate their
[SPEAKER_01]: production practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a good starting block for the
bare bones of the plant to see how
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus interacted in the plant without
pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additional work does need to be done with
pruning, defoliating, and leaching of the
[SPEAKER_01]: system and flushing to see, do you need a
boost later if you remove the phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: that you store up at a young plant when
it's not necessarily needed before
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's an excellent point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought up that comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do hope we do see more research come
out around pruning, because we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty wide range of cultural practices in
the cannabis industry ranging from
[SPEAKER_00]: removing pretty much all fan leaves to
leaving a significant amount of canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I would love to see that
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's something you guys will do
someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, tell me a little bit about,
so the paper that you authored is with
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul and Dylan Kidd and Brian Whipker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Elevated Phosphorus Fertility
Impact on Cannabis Sativa, Bayox Growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and Nutrient Accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what led to your interest,
I guess, in formulating this trial?
[SPEAKER_00]: And writing this paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: So initially, we started off with Paul's
work looking at the lower fertility
[SPEAKER_01]: ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember I went into one of the hemp
grow stores, which was close to where me
[SPEAKER_01]: and Paul had our research going on,
and they were selling products that had
[SPEAKER_01]: close to 200 parpoly and phosphorus in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I struggled to understand how I could
get or we were getting healthy looking
[SPEAKER_01]: plants at, you know, 11 and a quarter
1530.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone is selling a product that is
200 parpoly phosphorus in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we were seeing other things
online saying that you really needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: boost it up even up to the 250 300 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was harder for me to comprehend why
that was needed and why a grower should
[SPEAKER_01]: invest that much money when we were able
to get results for much less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Paul and I decided to build upon his
work and expand it further to these upper
[SPEAKER_01]: rates, but then also backpedaling to Paul
Nelson, who was a former professor at NC
[SPEAKER_01]: State and Josh Henry, who was a former Ph
.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: student.
[SPEAKER_01]: They looked at other floriculture crops
and phosphorus as growth control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you increase phosphorus to higher
levels, you get more internode stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Paul's work was looking at those lower
rates where we might have been seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: growth control and not seeing as much
internode elongation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to compare it to what the
industry was doing and how that affected
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we get really lanky plants that needed
to be supported or were we controlling the
[SPEAKER_01]: internode stretch by using less phosphorus
while still getting the same growth
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern as the other two researchers found
with many other floriculture species?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was more of, well, we know what
happens at lower rates, less tests against
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're seeing in the industry of
these, what we considered elevated
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus compared to what was needed to
be considered healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, take me through your paper,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the sort of your methodology and
what were you measuring?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I followed a very similar system that
Paul used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used four different phosphorus fertility
rates of 15, 60, 120, and 180 part per
[SPEAKER_01]: million phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was constant feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only element that I modified was
the phosphorus rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We held nitrogen constant, all the other
macros and micros constant other than the
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus so that we try to have that
fair comparison of everything is held
[SPEAKER_01]: equal but the phosphorus rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because we did have high or low P
doesn't mean that our nitrogen changed so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we didn't see impacts of other
elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew the plants for 12 weeks in total,
four weeks vegetative and eight weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: reproductive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, similar to Paul's,
I did not prune, trim, modify the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at weeks 12, we looked at plant growth
overall and nutrient accumulation and
[SPEAKER_01]: total bud weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the two studies are very similar in
how we conducted the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically had a cut and paste system
for the two where we only modified the
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus rates that were used to try and
get that fair comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you feel like container side could
have been a limiting factor in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: root growth in your study as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you not see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was terminating the experiment,
I didn't notice any root bound plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I only went out for 12 weeks compared
to 16 weeks as Paul did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the extra four weeks of vegetative
growth for Paul's, I really think
[SPEAKER_01]: increased that biomass affair a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially looking at a different
container size, maybe going up to a three
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pot instead of a one gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have seen a little bit of
difference as well, but as soon as those
[SPEAKER_01]: roots got to the side of the container,
they really took off and thrived under all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the phosphorus rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you went 12 weeks total,
so eight weeks of veg or reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and that, oh, sorry, you did four
weeks of veg and then eight weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you did four weeks shorter than Paul
did on the veg side, not on the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And okay, I'm looking at table two at 12
weeks of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of tell me what your findings
were?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so after 12 weeks of total growth,
we did not see a difference in height,
[SPEAKER_01]: diameter or total total above ground
biomass from 15 to 180.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will comment on the height.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was slightly surprised that as we
increased all the way up to 180 part per
[SPEAKER_01]: million P, we didn't see a difference in
height.
[SPEAKER_01]: I expected the 180 part per million P
plants to have a little bit more stretch
[SPEAKER_01]: in the internodes leading to greater plant
height, but we didn't even see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total bud weight was significantly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, everything here is within two
grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the means, and we don't notice a clear
trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a peak at 60 ppm, but then go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only difference we can say was
between 60 and 120, but everything is
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly consistent across all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't say that, you know,
picking one of these rates will yield you
[SPEAKER_01]: a greater bud weight compared to the
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like there's much of a
difference, like you said, over the over
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a significant range in P rates,
you know, going from 15 to 180.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you look at below ground weight,
weight at all biomass or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't visually assessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we didn't wash roots like Paul
did visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't see a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I can quantify a difference for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for all of these rates, they looked
fairly similar visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you did you did you notice anything
else visually amongst the difference in P
[SPEAKER_00]: rates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you were to walk into the
greenhouse, could you see a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: difference from one treatment to the other
if you didn't know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything about the experiment?
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly could not tell any differences
across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at them, we could have potentially
expected a little bit darker foliage for
[SPEAKER_01]: those that had greater phosphorus
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, looking across the board of the
plants, they all look very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very hard to tell that anything
was different amongst any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus fertility rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you see any issues of toxicities
or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing no, if you didn't see any
real visual differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did not we didn't report any
phosphorus toxicity symptoms, even getting
[SPEAKER_01]: up to one hundred and eighty part per
million P constant feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, when you get phosphorus that
high, you actually see an antagonism with
[SPEAKER_01]: iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with having high phosphorus fertility
rates in the plant, uptaking high P,
[SPEAKER_01]: you actually will block the plant from
uptaking iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did not see a clear trend on iron
levels other than actually the lower
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus fertility rates shown a lower
iron concentration, which is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: backwards from the anticipated antagonism
that's in the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing visually different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't see the antagonisms that are
typically associated with phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm looking at that chart right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else in this in this
chart that you wanted to point out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of nutrient accumulation in the leaf
tissue at 12 weeks?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the 12 week nutrient accumulation,
I definitely want to highlight the
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we noticed down at the 15 part per
million P, we have the lowest phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar concentration, which is to be
expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we noticed that we don't really
see a plateau 15 to 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a linear increase, 60 to 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even when you get up to 180 P,
it's significantly different than all the
[SPEAKER_01]: other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can supply the plant with as much
phosphorus as you possibly can,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will uptake it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, just because that plant's
uptaking it, we're not seeing that return
[SPEAKER_01]: in investment on your growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant's exhibiting luxury
consumption and it is likely that it can
[SPEAKER_01]: sequester it very well all day and it
won't antagonize other elements of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good at storing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you're not seeing a return on
that in terms of plant growth in this
[SPEAKER_01]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not seeing any antagonisms
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either at those high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just wasting your money kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not harming the plant, but you're not
seeing a benefit of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's seeming that it's just storing it in
the plant and it's sitting in the leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: not harming or helping you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this kind of points to, you know,
if we can get away with that 15 to 30
[SPEAKER_01]: range that Paul noted, why do we need to
have a hundred and eight part per million
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus supplied to the plant when it
will uptake it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's not just leaching out the
bottom of the pot, but you're not seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: that increase in growth or increase in bud
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to figure this out in my head
as I'm as I'm saying it, so this may not
[SPEAKER_00]: be a complete thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm noticing that the K levels went down
or sorry, the K levels went up as you went
[SPEAKER_00]: from 15 to 180 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your calcium levels went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that related to pH at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I would have initially thought that you
would have had greater root biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially leading to greater overall
nutrient uptake with higher P levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that doesn't seem to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you begin to explain I guess
those those numbers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the uptake patterns for those,
seeing the potassium increase,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not aware of any literature that's
published on increase in potassium foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake with increasing P. However,
we do see that strong trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also want to point that it's
following similar to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phosphorus where that 60 and 120 are
fairly similar as well within being
[SPEAKER_01]: greater than 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to the 180, it kind of seems out
of plateaus for awhile and then increases
[SPEAKER_01]: once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the calcium decrease,
I'm not aware of an antagonism between.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus and calcium, Paul, are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if if you refer to, there's a chart
called Mulder's chart, M-U-L-D-E-R
[SPEAKER_02]: apostrophe S chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're not aware of this resource,
it's a it's a good chart to be familiar
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks kind of weird to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole bunch of nutrients kind of
around a circle and a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: arrows going together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as phosphorus is concerned,
you will see an antagonism between
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus and calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what the arrows are
indicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one nutrient may essentially
have a stimulation or a synergism with
[SPEAKER_02]: another element.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you get an increase in phosphorus,
for example, you may get more magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you get phosphorus too high,
like Patrick said, it can cause
[SPEAKER_02]: antagonisms with iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: And calcium is one of those that it can
cause antagonisms with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that that decrease is
probably what we're seeing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this is more of a guideline.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to really depend on what type
of system you're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you in soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you in a substrate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you using, you know, water soluble
fertilizers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you in an organic system?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mulder's chart is more of a guideline
and general trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some nuances that exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, TAD, pH is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's definitely complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it not to be quite as useful for
me in organic production, just because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many more variables associated
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nutrient cycling from microbiology
just contributes a whole other factor
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also another level of buffering,
I find.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my initial thought when I saw these
results was, OK, the increase in P is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably leading to a greater root
biomass, which means we're getting better
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient uptake, which explains the K.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got to calcium, and I didn't
know quite what to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of threw it out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, OK, well, maybe the higher
levels of P are lowering the pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would cause maybe less calcium
availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that didn't explain the K.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just curious what your guys'
thoughts were on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, for the pH in EC of the
study, it was consistent across all of the
P fertility rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the phosphorus input was not altering
the substrate pH or the EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That remained constant across all
treatments here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I would assume that a level of
phosphate that high would lower your pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least lower your solution going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started off with using a
custom-blended substrate where we blended
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have any inputs coming in
other than our lime charge and our wetting
[SPEAKER_01]: agent, as well as the P and the perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not have to buffer the pH at all in
the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used modified hoglans, so everything
was fairly well balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after 12 weeks, we didn't see a impact
on substrate pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is partly by trying to really
carefully balance the salts and the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: taking them up rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after 12 weeks of growth, we didn't
see any impact on pH or EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul, when you were increasing your P
fertility rates, did you see an impact on
[SPEAKER_01]: your pH or EC?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't see an increase either.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I'll piggyback off of that
is that with the modified hoglans
[SPEAKER_02]: solution, you're keeping your
water-soluble ion at a constant
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the individual salts that you're
adding into that recipe will change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on that change, we did have to
add in some sodium hydroxide into the
[SPEAKER_02]: system to even out some of those pH
charges there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to answer your question, Tad,
we didn't necessarily amend the substrate
[SPEAKER_02]: pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we're custom-blending these
fertilizer solutions, sometimes we do have
[SPEAKER_02]: to increase our sodium hydroxide to buffer
out that increased pH charge that could be
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from adjusting some of the salt
inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an organic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bear with me when I don't totally wrap
my brain around exactly how you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: formulating these fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you explaining to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could, real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're spot on, though, Tad, that this
molders chart here is very much a tool for
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate-based water-soluble ions,
not necessarily an organic system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're spot on in a lot of your
insights here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't sell yourself short, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate what you guys are
doing and coming on the show to share this
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an organic grower, when we start
talking about pea rates, my initial
[SPEAKER_00]: thought goes to, well, one, the
environmental impact, which we already
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of touched on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pea-soluble-izing microbes,
and mycorrhizal fungi, and the role those
[SPEAKER_00]: play in making pea available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because typically, in an organic system,
and even in a lot of conventional systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have high levels of unavailable
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really getting available pea
that's the big challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, your research doesn't exactly
speak to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But did you guys have any thoughts on this
or anything I mentioned there as you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been studying phosphorus so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I can comment on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was given a little time buffer there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're very correct that once you move
into a soil system, or something more like
[SPEAKER_02]: a living bed, or even an organic system,
the microbiology just becomes so much more
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have your adsorption, your
desorption of the ions, your complexation.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as what the microbes are going to
eat, the rate of microbial growth and
[SPEAKER_02]: mineralization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it becomes just so much more complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oftentimes, you have to dump a whole
bunch more reserve phosphorus into that
[SPEAKER_02]: type of system just to get your plant
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that would be just
absolutely amazing would be looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: adsorption and desorption of phosphorus
under these main systems that the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: is using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether that be a living bed or actual
some sort of soil-based work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we get there, there's a few key
aspects that need to be explored,
[SPEAKER_02]: such as uptake and partitioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then reallocation would be another.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your spot on's had that this is an
extremely dynamic system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oftentimes, your reserve or soil pH
can be just so much higher than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which the plant available concentrations
would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to kind of go off of that,
I think it really comes back around to,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a grower, what are your production
practices?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going in a hydroponic system,
this kind of acts as a cornerstone to say
[SPEAKER_01]: you can really dial your phosphorus rate
back compared to being in an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need to increase it and give
yourself a little bit more of that buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this kind of acts as, what is your,
for plant available pea, how much of that
[SPEAKER_01]: is needed in certain systems?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of a good cornerstone for where
growers can start to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everyone needs to kind of modify this
baking recipe for what they're doing and
[SPEAKER_01]: how it's going to work for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: While this serves as a good cornerstone of
literature, because it's been all plant
[SPEAKER_01]: available pea, those who are using more
soil or organic systems will need to
[SPEAKER_01]: modify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this research you guys did is
huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't thank you enough for it,
because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a grower, if the only takeaway I get
from this research is to start
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting with lower rates of
phosphorus, that could have a dramatic
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on the industry in terms of the
amount of pea that we really need to mine
[SPEAKER_00]: or purchase or apply to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope people will consider
experimenting in their facility with lower
[SPEAKER_00]: rates of pea and see how their plants
respond and if that has an impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to seeing some real
life results in the field and see if those
[SPEAKER_00]: mirror and trend along with what your
research has shown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll piggyback off of that again here,
Tad, and say that this is one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting areas for me personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be a scientist and you can do this
work and you can publish it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it feels like you're just
shouting into the void.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's moments like these where
people can come alongside and talk through
[SPEAKER_02]: the science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we as scientists can learn from
people who are in the industry and in
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a give and take.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the science and we hold things
constant and we do this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, it's people like yourself
doing the amazing work that you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: with the organic stuff and then industry
input and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all only going to be better
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring up a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a grower, my challenge is not just
finding information and research,
[SPEAKER_00]: but being able to understand that research
and not drawing conclusions that may not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily be accurate or jumping to
conclusions based off of one paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where people like you and
Patrick can come in and say, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what we can kind of say from our
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's what we can't say necessarily
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe we can point you in a direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what growers can give back is,
hey, this is an area that really needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be researched and something that we need
to we need to get more data on so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can make better decisions in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that sort of synergistic
relationship that I hope we can improve
[SPEAKER_00]: on, because historically, that's always
been a challenge in agriculture between
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers or greenhouse growers and
academia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of where this whole podcast
idea came around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate you guys sharing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that note, I do want to just once again
plug your original paper talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient disorders, Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that paper is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone should have it as a resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently shared that poster on our
Instagram page that you guys put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something you're ever going to be
printing or are there other places people
[SPEAKER_00]: can find that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, we've had so many inquiries
about printing and everything from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're still trying to find a way to
figure out how to get that out there as
[SPEAKER_02]: far as like a printing service goes and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually, yes, we're hoping to get
that in some sort of form.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing I will say is we've had a
lot of requests over the years to just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of have a centralized location for
all of our research and our resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Patrick actually has been spearheading
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll let him kind of talk about that
and kind of plug the newest development
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to kind of build off of the poster that
Paul created that we got a lot of positive
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback on, we took that poster and me
and Paul built this website where we house
[SPEAKER_01]: all of our resources at one location.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's Cannabis Scientifica and it'll be
linked below.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have each nutrient disorder has
its own tab where you can read the
[SPEAKER_01]: description.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have for most of them,
at least one resource attached below.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know phosphorus, we have both of these
articles in one or two other popular
[SPEAKER_01]: press.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this website was really to build the
culmination of all of the grower magazine
[SPEAKER_01]: and extension alerts that we've put out,
as well as our scientific research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those who are just simply trying to
diagnose something, it's an excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to go into detail on how
can I craft my phosphorus rate or my
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium rates, you can go on there and
you can find more of the in-depth science
[SPEAKER_01]: of what we observed, as well as all of the
images and photos that we've culminated
[SPEAKER_01]: and put in different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we finally have them all housed in one
location for people who are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: problem solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll definitely have that link
available on the podcast page and where
[SPEAKER_00]: social media allows me to put links.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Instagram makes it really
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll definitely have that on the
podcast page for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool that you guys make that
available to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I want to touch on and
hopefully have you back on here soon,
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, is to talk about you have another
paper out called Magnesium Impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium's Impact on Cannabis Sativa,
Growth in Cannabinoid Production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get you guys back on soon
to talk about this most recent paper
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Patrick actually was the one that
spearheaded that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it'll be nice to come back
on because I'll be able to take the back
[SPEAKER_02]: seat on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm sure we'll get questions out of
this phosphorus podcast post, and maybe we
[SPEAKER_00]: can answer those and then tackle this
magnesium paper here soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any last words before we sign off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just thank you so much for allowing us to
highlight our research and really get it
[SPEAKER_01]: out to growers and everyone who could
hopefully benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for all the work that you've
done with the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Patrick.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, again, just say thank you so much
for having us, Tad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to be back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always really enjoy your podcast,
your Instagram, your posts and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always just super insightful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love how you just bring this amazing
synergistic view to all of your work and
[SPEAKER_02]: this attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really inspiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we appreciate you highlighting the
research and your partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to all the growers out there,
you know, keep growing, keep doing what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all only better together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you guys have a wonderful rest of
your day over there on the East Coast and
[SPEAKER_00]: look forward to talking soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds great.
