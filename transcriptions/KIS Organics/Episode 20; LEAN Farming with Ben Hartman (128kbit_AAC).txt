cutting edge of organic growing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: science-based perspective and draw on top
experts from around the industry to share
[SPEAKER_01]: their wisdom and knowledge.

[SPEAKER_01]: This week's podcast is especially
important to anyone making a living off of
[SPEAKER_01]: farming or cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: To many people today, using the words
factory and farm in the same sentence is
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing short of sacrilege.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many cases though, the same sound
business practices apply whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: producing cars or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben Hartman has found that incorporating
the best new ideas from business into his
[SPEAKER_01]: farming can drastically cut out waste and
increase profits, making the farms more
[SPEAKER_01]: environmentally and economically
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working smarter, not harder, also prevents
the kind of burnout that startup farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: or growers often encounter in the face of
long, hard, backbreaking labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben and his wife Rachel own and operate
Clay Bottom Farm in Goshen, Indiana,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they make their living growing and
selling specialty crops on less than one
[SPEAKER_01]: acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their food is sold locally to restaurants
and cafeterias, at a farmers market,
[SPEAKER_01]: and through a CSA program.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2017, Ben was named one of the 50
emerging green leaders in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States by Grist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a long shot reaching out to Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that cannabis cultivation can be
off-putting to many traditional farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was honored that he was willing to come
on the show to talk about his book and the
[SPEAKER_01]: concept of lean farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot stress enough how important this
book can be in changing your business for
[SPEAKER_01]: the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been telling all my friends and
growers about it and made some massive
[SPEAKER_01]: changes on our farm based on the
principles outlined in his books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without further ado though, here's this
week's interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you taking the time to
come on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for my listeners, I heard Ben at the
Focus on Farming conference that was local
[SPEAKER_01]: to me this winter and heard about his book
and the concepts have already had a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: impact on my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to get into all the
details of the changes we've made because
[SPEAKER_01]: of your book, but we made some pretty
major financial and philosophical
[SPEAKER_01]: commitments to these concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think every farmer needs to read
your book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to start off by giving listeners
though, a little bit of information about
[SPEAKER_01]: your own personal history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up on a Northern Indiana,
500 acre corn and soybean farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our farm was just down the road from
Earl Butts, who was Richard M.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nixon's secretary of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was made famous for saying,
get big or get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you're going to make it
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is the mindset with which I
entered farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, my wife and I got married and
we purchased a five acre property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was my thinking that this is a
stepping stone property and we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually, you know, we'd expand to 10
acres and then 20 acres and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then work our way up from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I was growing up,
the metrics for success, you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: successful farmer in Northern Indiana if
every year you've got a bigger tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year you rented or grew on more
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year you put up another grain bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you didn't, then something was
wrong with your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the mindset with which I
entered farming and to my judgment,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we had, the type of farming I
wanted to do was small scale and local
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables where we were selling direct to
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was labor intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't take us long before I
realized I just kind of constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding just wasn't going to work on a
number of levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it meant that we were having to
find more accounts further away from home
[SPEAKER_00]: and drive to Chicago, drive to Detroit or
Indianapolis to find accounts for food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was stretching the definition of
being a local farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also just from a psychological
standpoint, it was just constant stress
[SPEAKER_00]: and it kind of hit home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit home one afternoon and actually let
me, I tell you a story here of how,
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you how our greenhouse ended up on
the roof of our barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year we used to have what we call
pizza and weed party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a name that we cleverly chose
to lure college students out to our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd a greenhouse or two and then we'd
feed them pizza afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this one, about 10 years ago,
we're getting ready for our pizza and weed
[SPEAKER_00]: party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd set out all the tools and Rachel
and I won the house for a break and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a light breeze in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, by mid afternoon, the wind was
just starting to pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually this slow wind turned into
a gale force wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we heard, Rachel heard a thunk and she
ran to the window and she said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, you better come see what's going on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I ran to the window and saw our
greenhouse had landed on our roof and had
[SPEAKER_00]: the barn not blocked the greenhouse,
it would have ended up in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Canada, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the lean system, you're supposed
to ask the question five times whenever
[SPEAKER_00]: something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get at the root of every
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is the reason that greenhouse
ended up on the roof?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time we asked that question,
we say, well, it's because there's a high
[SPEAKER_00]: power wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we asked that question enough
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ask it again, the second reason is
that it was under engineered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you ask, well, what's the reason it
wasn't under engineered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was in a hurry building the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, by the time you ask why five times
the root cause of the greenhouse being on
[SPEAKER_00]: the roof of our barn was simply that I was
overworked and trying to expand the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that happened, we realized,
hey, we need to maybe think about our
[SPEAKER_00]: business model and maybe there's a
different way of running and growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: business and that's where the lean system
entered our thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about what lean
manufacturing is?
[SPEAKER_01]: So people kind of have a foundation of
where you started this idea of lean
[SPEAKER_01]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just I want to back up just a minute,
just to clarify kind of who we are at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We raise organic vegetables and we do it
on less than an acre of land and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our accounts are within a mile and a half
of our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of an uber local micro farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're making a comfortable living over
$100,000 a year doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what lean manufacturing essentially
amounts to is putting on a set of
[SPEAKER_00]: eyeglasses and noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You read a lot about seeing and vision in
the lean literature, but essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: you're noticing when am I adding value for
the customer?
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, when am I touching my
product and causing the value of my
[SPEAKER_00]: product to go up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when am I contributing to Muda,
which is a term we roughly translate as
[SPEAKER_00]: waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's essentially any activity
that is happening on your farm that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: directly adding value for your customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Japanese very precise culture and
they identified seven specific types of
[SPEAKER_00]: Muda's and now they've added three or four
new types of Muda's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just have one for Muda in English,
we just call it waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's like how some cultures they
have 600 or more words for reindeer or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Japanese have thought more carefully
about non value adding process than we
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so essentially what you want to do is
maximize the amount of time and effort
[SPEAKER_00]: going into value adding activities and
minimize or better yet eliminate all the
[SPEAKER_00]: waste activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before hearing you speak and reading,
reading your book, I had, I had heard of
[SPEAKER_01]: lean manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, one of our main people at our
farm was telling me about how we should
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate this into the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was familiar with Toyota and all,
you know, some of what they had done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, there was a huge disconnect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't able to, in my brain,
go from what Toyota does in a
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing facility to all the
different aspects and things going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt like there were too many
variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what your book really does is connects
the dot between that lean manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: and then this thing, this concept of lean
farming, which is that something that you
[SPEAKER_01]: coined?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this your term?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, no, because I, farms in Asia,
Asia and in Scandinavia have been using
[SPEAKER_00]: lean systems thinking for several decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just new to North America here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to clarify too, they say lean came
from manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the first workers at Toyota in
the 1930s were rice farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's these rice farmers who brought
this lean way of thinking to the factory
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's part of the reason that
the seven types of ways that they
[SPEAKER_00]: originally identified at Toyota,
these are ways that are ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one has to wonder if agricultural
thinking didn't influence Toyota and
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't one of the reasons why Toyota
eventually became eight times more
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable than GM and Ford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think farmers, especially in 17th
and 18th century Japanese farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just had to be shrewd and they had to
farm or else they weren't going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of historical
sociological reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyhow, so that's, it's actually
originally as much an agricultural system
[SPEAKER_00]: as it is a manufacturing system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we dive in a little bit to the five
basic principles of lean before we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: too much about Muda?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have some great examples here in
your book, starting with, is it Siri?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean for the 5S process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so lean is, can roughly be thought of
as a series of there are four basic lean
[SPEAKER_00]: concepts that fit most appropriately in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first is to apply this 5S
organization system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second is identifying the value
from your customer and then getting rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: the moot bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the fourth step would be continuous
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can begin by talking about that
first step, which I think is the place to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin for most farms, is to use this 5S
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially there's five steps to
getting a workplace organized according to
[SPEAKER_00]: the lean system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all goes back to when am I adding
value?
[SPEAKER_00]: When am I contributing to a waste?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first step of that 5S process
is called Siri or sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what that means is you go
around your property and every object on
[SPEAKER_00]: that, in your work environment,
you ask a simple question, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: did you add value for a customer in the
past and for cannabis say in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you add value for a customer,
whether it's a fork or a hoe or a planter
[SPEAKER_00]: container or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you struggle to come up with an
answer, if you have to think it over,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's probably time to get rid of that
item.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tell you, they're very ruthless
about the only items in the workplace
[SPEAKER_00]: where those that are being used on a daily
basis for adding value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do this twice a year on our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go around to every object and some say
you should actually physically touch the
[SPEAKER_00]: object.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't physically touch every object,
but we at least come close to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: physically close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ask that question, did this row
cover, did this hoe, did this traction
[SPEAKER_00]: implement add value in the past six
months?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the answer is no, then we get it
off the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been pretty ruthless about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to have stuff on our
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we farm with enough tools that would
fit in a small size pickup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you're doing this, you want to
choose tools that you want to farm with a
[SPEAKER_00]: few tools that add a lot of value.
[SPEAKER_00]: That perform many functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we love, for instance, a hoe that
can be a grubbing hoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a strong hoe for flipping soil if
you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet it has a fine point so we can use
it for finer cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the BCS where you can swap out multiple
implements and can perform a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always on the lookout for how can we
farm with fewer tools and get more work
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that kind of leads us into the next
one, which is set in order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you say fewer tools,
you are removing tools, but you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: putting the tools where they're most
useful and even duplicating tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we used to, for instance,
we used to have a centralized tool storage
[SPEAKER_00]: area, a tool shed, like a lot of farms
would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing we did, a lean
consultant came out and said, you really
[SPEAKER_00]: need to take a stick of dynamite to that
tool shed because it's adding a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: muda to your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is for every process we had
to do say prune tomatoes, we'd have to
[SPEAKER_00]: walk 200, 300 paces to the tool shed,
grab the pruners, then walk back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and prune the tomatoes and then
return the pruners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd put in as much work going to get the
pruners and returning them as we did
[SPEAKER_00]: actually pruning the tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we started to do in the lean
system is you want to hang your tools at
[SPEAKER_00]: eye level locations as close as possible
to their points of use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we have magnets spread out
across the property that hold knives and
[SPEAKER_00]: pruners that we use on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every greenhouse, before greenhouses,
everyone has a tool set up and the tools
[SPEAKER_00]: we need in that greenhouse are attached to
the greenhouse somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to say that's a huge one for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally light bulb went off because I
know for a fact, like some projects I
[SPEAKER_01]: would spend 15, 20 minutes just looking
for a tool because it wasn't replaced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be on the entire other side of
the property from where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea of having an extra set of
pruners or extra sets of shovels or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever implement tool I'm implementing
in the location where I'm going to use it
[SPEAKER_01]: can save not just my time, but my
employee's time, which I'm paying labor
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working on getting all of the
right tools in the right places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's going to save us a ton
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's OK to duplicate tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say if a tool costs $50 or less,
we're going to probably duplicate that
[SPEAKER_00]: tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for instance, every greenhouse,
we own probably 15 or so knives.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we harvest with even though we only
going to use three or four knives at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every greenhouse has a couple of them
attached to the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that for the reason that they're
physically closer to where we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that small investment is paid off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we don't buy a tractor, a separate
tractor for every greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a limit to tool
duplicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is to keep your tools closer
to workstations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll put up some pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have some mobile workstation
examples in your book that are really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting, too, that show that you can
you can move the tools around with the
[SPEAKER_01]: worker so that they're easily accessible
and easy to see when you're getting low on
[SPEAKER_01]: supplies as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Darren Vollmer, an excellent farmer up
in Wisconsin, he would have more workers
[SPEAKER_00]: than we have several dozen workers during
peak harvest season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he does is he would have a five
gallon bucket with an organizing basket
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every worker gets a bucket with
precisely the tools they need and they
[SPEAKER_00]: carry that bucket around with them and
they're responsible for those tools in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that to make sure tools
are where they belong or in your hands,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're either in their place or in your
hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no third option.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that leads us to our next concept,
which is shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, there's a lot of language
about you read a lot about vision and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing in the lean literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea behind the shine concept is
you want to clean your tool, your
[SPEAKER_00]: workspaces with a tooth toothbrush and
make sure they're well lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your most used tools, workspaces should be
very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason behind that is you want to
see when waste is creeping in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with with cannabis production,
you want to think about when are the steps
[SPEAKER_00]: in my process when there's the most defect
happening, you know, when you're cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe it's in packaging or whatever,
you want to make sure those spaces are
[SPEAKER_00]: very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very well lit, too, so you can see
your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the principle here, too, is you want
to perform size O in short high frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: spurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of long, low frequency,
let me explain the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short high frequency means that every time
we're done, you know, watching a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of lettuce in the processing area
or hosing a hundred pounds or a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: bunches of carrots, we're going to restore
that processing processing area to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that means we're going to take it
all the way back to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's clean condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hang pictures up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our processing area, so that there's no
ambiguity about what zero looks like in
[SPEAKER_00]: that processing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every time we're done working in
there, every every hour, 90 minute chunk
[SPEAKER_00]: of time that we're done working,
we're going to take it back to zero is the
[SPEAKER_00]: language we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we used to do, the long,
low frequency method would be to we just
[SPEAKER_00]: junk up the farm from say, March until
Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we thought, hey, we'll have the
time and energy all winter to clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we never did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always just every year just got more
cluttered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which which which happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to these first three
steps, sorting, setting in order and
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning, the thing I tell people is that
you don't have to do it all in one
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did actually about a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just we got several wagon loads off of
our property, several tons of junk
[SPEAKER_00]: literally off our property.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it one big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can do is just make sure that
you're headed in the right direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the trajectory that you're you're
you're on is ultimately the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because trajectory is a very powerful
psychological force.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most powerful force in the world,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you think about it,
your your firm is headed in one of two
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either getting more cluttered every
growing season or you're getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: decluttered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only headed in one of two
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just want to know your headed the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think this is a really important
step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one that we are taking baby steps
on ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mentioned to you before we
started the podcast, I've actually brought
[SPEAKER_01]: in some really large dumpsters that we
filled.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got rid of a whole bunch of plastic
pots that we were we've been storing a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bunch of other other just literally
just junk that we need to remove off the
[SPEAKER_01]: property or things we weren't using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the the psychological effects of this
has been really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: The staff is has a cleaner space to work
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have take more pride in their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not there's a there's a psychological
impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was something that I learned from
you was the I didn't realize the
[SPEAKER_01]: psychological impact of having a pile of
junk, the amount of stress it created and
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact I had to keep thinking about it
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it's off the property,
I can let it go emotionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading a book right now called Deep
Work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd highly recommend it for anyone
wants to delve deeper in these concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is that we're actually
happiest and we're the most productive
[SPEAKER_00]: when we have just what we need in front of
us and no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially in the cell phone and in
the smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say the average office worker
experiences some sort of disruption every
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the farm, that would that happens,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether it be you're disrupted because
you can't find the tool you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or or because your cell phone goes off or
just constant interruption, constant
[SPEAKER_00]: disruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to get into what language
language uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call a flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to enter into a workflow in order
to achieve maximum productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means we're working for about an hour
to 90 minutes without interruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get to that point,
you can repeat a process of getting into a
[SPEAKER_00]: deep flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been phenomenal in our farm,
how much more productive we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've always been interrupted and
it is hard to maintain your train of
[SPEAKER_01]: thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's good studies out there that
show that we're not able to multitask as
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively as we actually think we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we continue to disrupt our work,
it actually changes the neural pathways in
[SPEAKER_00]: our brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually change how we think and
becomes we can do long term damage to our
[SPEAKER_00]: brain and make it long term more difficult
to enter that state of deep flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's very important and
something that's overlooked often.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that multitasking is often here
is often heralded as something you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: work towards, like the open office concept
that Google's new offices are just totally
[SPEAKER_00]: open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Facebook, too, would have open
offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but the reality is that you you open
yourself up to a lot of distraction and
[SPEAKER_00]: which is detrimental, ultimately to the
bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing you mentioned that I
wanted to touch on was the idea of using
[SPEAKER_01]: photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a brilliant idea because the
amount of time it takes to explain and
[SPEAKER_01]: train an employee on what a space should
look like or the amount of time for them
[SPEAKER_01]: to read all the every step if you want to
write things out is is pretty detrimental
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to them being able to just look
at a photo and say, this is what it looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it needs to look like and
make those changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good segue in segue into the
fourth step of the five s process,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is standardization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you perform those first three
steps, sorting, setting in order and
[SPEAKER_00]: shining, you want to do it the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to repeat the same steps,
especially with shining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so photos really do communicate a
thousand words much and much more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, we hang photos of what our
clean hosing station should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't have to tell workers
every time they said these crates over
[SPEAKER_00]: here and set these boxes over here and mop
the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just say, hey, make it look like what
the picture is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let's touch on the last one
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sustained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since what Toyota used sustained means
you want to make sure that these this five
[SPEAKER_00]: s process is part of deep is deeply
ingrained into your workplace culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a couple of ways of doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Toyota used to do is literally send
someone around each workstation and give a
[SPEAKER_00]: numerical rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on how closely the workers were
using the five s system and then give them
[SPEAKER_00]: bonuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the best ways to sustain
the practice on a small farm is through
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging lots of pictures up around the
farm and asking people to keep the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking like what those pictures look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also sometimes helpful to have a
third person say not you as the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: manager or owner, but have a worker give
an audit, give an occasional audit maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: once a month or something you could do
once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even just do a quick walk around and give
a numerical rating to how close you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using the five s system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you discipline yourself to make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into the next section,
which talks a little bit about what value
[SPEAKER_01]: means and how you identify that for your
for your customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that story that you you told at
the conference regarding the Toyota
[SPEAKER_01]: employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this thinking in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: anyhow that we know more than our
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Steve Jobs used this it was famous for
not listening to customers and he used to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, I know what my customers want more
than they know what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be true and especially tech
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be some exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for most businesses, especially
in agriculture, the best phrasing I've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard is from Jim Womack.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote the book Lean Thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you want to start with the
customer and work backwards from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So begin with the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work backwards from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the customer is the only force that
is allowed to identify value in the lean
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to be very precise about
identifying value, which means you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen very, very closely to your
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Japanese have this tradition
called Genchi Genbutsu, which means up
[SPEAKER_00]: close and personal observation to
thoroughly understand the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Genchi Genbutsu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of my favorite stories of
Genchi Genbutsu in practice is in 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Toyota said it's time to read his eye
in the Sienna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Toyota was not they were not the first
in the minivan market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were kind of trailing behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they quickly took over the
minivan market because of what this one
[SPEAKER_00]: engineer did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they sent him over to North
America, their primary market,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he told them to drive a van in all
parts of Mexico, Canada and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he spent better part of a year doing
this, closely observing how we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: the vans over our vans over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he noticed that in Santa Fe,
New Mexico, for instance, he had trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needed a tighter turning radius than
the current Sienna had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he called home and said we need to
tighten the turning radius by 15 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: to get up and down the alleyways in Santa
Fe, New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tighten up that turning radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he noticed in western part of the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: that we drove long distances and we were
we were eating like four course meals in
[SPEAKER_00]: our vans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this wasn't a cultural tradition in
Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he invented this beautiful flip up
console that this current Sienna has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put something like 500 cup holders
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no excuse not to have not to be
drinking while you're driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my favorite example is he went to
Ann Arbor, Michigan, a couple of hours
[SPEAKER_00]: north of our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went to the parking lot of a Home
Depot and he didn't go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just stood in the parking lot and
observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he noticed was that people were
trying to stuff four by eight sheets of
[SPEAKER_00]: drywall or plywood or whatever into the
van and they just couldn't quite get it
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they'd bungee the back hatch or try
to strap it to the roof and they became
[SPEAKER_00]: very frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he called home at that point and
said from that parking lot, he said we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to get a four by eight sheet of
whatever in the van, the next van that we
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, if you own a mini van
produced after that point in his journey,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the odds are very high that you can
get a four by eight sheet of plywood in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then otherwise Toyota or Honda or GM
or Ford, everyone followed suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is that notice how closely
they're observing their customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is close personal observation and
then acting on those observations and
[SPEAKER_00]: their level of observation, very minute,
very precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and Rachel and I had to admit,
we heard stories like this when we started
[SPEAKER_00]: looking into the system, we had to admit
we'd never come close to taking our
[SPEAKER_00]: customers that seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the first things we did
after we'd clean up the farm using that
[SPEAKER_00]: five S system was to perform this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can boot through process with our
customers and really get to know what they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the three questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll summarize the whole process with
three questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, you ask number one,
what do they want?
[SPEAKER_00]: What specific products are they asking
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two is when do they want it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third is how much?
[SPEAKER_00]: In what amounts do they want it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So very simple questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they want?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do they want?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet most people and most cannabis
producers, most vegetable growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: corn and soybean farmers certainly are not
taking the baby step it would take to get
[SPEAKER_00]: precise answers to those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really hinders your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what you're looking at there
is how do you identify values?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what adds value?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what does not add value?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're essentially trying to
focus on ways to raise, raise the value or
[SPEAKER_01]: do more activities that add value and less
activities that don't add value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give a concrete example of
something you did on your farm that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: change based on customer response or
customer feedback?
[SPEAKER_00]: We for a number of years ran a CSA,
which means community supported
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they this means is customers paid
us at the beginning of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we gave them a box of food every
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first we said you had to come out
to the farm and pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we gave them a couple of hours on
Friday afternoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we began this process and we asked
those three questions to our customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those questions obviously helped us
determine what to put in the CSA boxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: how big to make those CSA boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we altered the amounts and the items
that went into those boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we heard most feedback was that
we love actually what you're giving us.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's inconvenient to come pick up
Friday afternoons at your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started using pickup locations
around town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they wouldn't have to make that 10
mile trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the end of the next growing
season, we asked those questions again and
[SPEAKER_00]: they said we love the pickup locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's hard to get there just on
Friday afternoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the following growing season,
the third growing season, we installed
[SPEAKER_00]: coolers at those pickup locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they could pick up whenever during
the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We told them we're going to deliver Friday
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come get it whenever it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of that season,
we asked the same questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said we love the coolers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes pick up much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's just actually still kind of
hard to go to the grocery store and then
[SPEAKER_00]: go to your pickup locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're doing our groceries in two
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did is we asked our
customers, where do most of you do your
[SPEAKER_00]: grocery shopping?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we partnered with that grocery
store to use them as a CSA pickup
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was our local food co-op.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that our customers could do their
grocery shopping, get their CSA boxes in
[SPEAKER_00]: one trip, save a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we asked those questions again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what we're hearing is we love that
being able to pick up at the supermarket
[SPEAKER_00]: saves a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving us the right amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love the ingredients that are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we want more we need some help
with cooking in the home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't have time to cook
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're partnering with the deli
department of our co-op to create a sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of local blue apron option in which we're
going to put a whole meal package
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be mostly our vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the deli would maybe bake a loaf
of bread or add some condiments and put a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole recipe, several recipes to put a
whole meal together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be a blue apron model for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, so the point is that's how we
retain CSA customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most CSAs lose more than half their
customers on an annual basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of external reasons
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more competition,
a lot of more places to get organic food
[SPEAKER_00]: than there was 20 years ago when CSAs were
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are internal practices a
farm can do to keep your customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I learned this lesson the hard
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally tens of thousands of dollars
I've wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off with an edible nursery with
all these permaculture plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really awesome plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, no one in my community
really cared.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't care that I had all these
really cool plants that I thought was
[SPEAKER_01]: really fascinating or some of my friends
thought were fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they sat on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to water them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to care for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: People came in and bought the same things,
blueberries, apples, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff they knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And occasionally I would sell some of
these other plants, but I had to lean down
[SPEAKER_01]: my nursery to what was actually selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't even really know this concept
at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just something I discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, we were growing a lot of
these really cool rare vegetables and
[SPEAKER_01]: heirloom plants, but again, no one was
buying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going to waste because I wasn't
looking at what the customer was valuing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was taking my values and trying to
impose them on the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having pounds and pounds of organic
habanero peppers doesn't do any good if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no one in the area that wants to
eat habanero peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made this mistake year after year,
and so I'm really excited that we've kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of been forced into this process as we've
learned the hard way what not to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping other people can avoid
making these mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't necessarily grow the plant that
you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow the plant that your customers are
going to value and want you to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're growing some Tulsi basils
that are holy basils for the local Indian
[SPEAKER_01]: community, as well as some certain
eggplants that they've requested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going on asking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we can do to support them rather than
what they can do to support us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to say that is that the
customer is the only one who defines
[SPEAKER_00]: value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they call that owner distortion,
owner value distortion via the technical
[SPEAKER_00]: term for what happens in a lot of
businesses where your own fascination is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting in the way of profits because the
customer should be out ahead pulling you
[SPEAKER_00]: along.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that we try to do is get all our
orders before we even purchase our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of the year, sit down
with all our chefs and map out who's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to purchase, who's going to eat every
single crop that we produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll get our seeds ordered and
go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to use that as a transition
into our next topic, which would be Muda,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is the most fascinating
aspect of Lean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you list 10 tools for minimizing
waste, which is essentially what Muda
[SPEAKER_01]: means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk about each of those,
just touch on them briefly, starting with
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea of minimizing your movement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, the Japanese identify
these types of waste in a production
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And motion waste is the sixth type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not first on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's prevalent on every farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea behind motion waste is you
want to actually count the number of times
[SPEAKER_00]: you touch your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, you want to achieve what
they call smooth flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to touch your product as
few times as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the grocery industry, they say you're
allowed three touches.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, selling a box of kicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You unload the kicks from the wholesale
distributor, put it on the shelf,
[SPEAKER_00]: customer picks it up, you check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the customer checks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they say as a grocer, you're allowed
three touches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you touch it, if you can get by
with just one touch, then you're making
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you touch it two times, then you're
probably breaking even.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get to three touches, you're
probably losing money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think on farms, we're allowed
probably five or six touches, a few more.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, not many more touches than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first tip I would have is to just
count and map out your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: What steps are involved in production?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how many times did you touch your
product before it got into the hand of the
[SPEAKER_00]: customer and try to get it down to four or
five touches?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you take me through that process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with carrots or tomato or maybe
lettuce to kind of describe what that
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll use an example of head
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we used to do was say we have 200
heads of lettuce that need to be picked
[SPEAKER_00]: and processed and sent off to your
customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you our old process.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we would harvest those 200 heads of
lettuce, someone would harvest and then
[SPEAKER_00]: take them up to the processing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else would pick up each head of
lettuce and clean each head of lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strip off the bad leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone else would pick it up again
and dunk each head of lettuce and wash it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're up to three touches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then someone would pick it up again
and wrap plastic around it or tie a band
[SPEAKER_00]: around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then someone would package it,
put it in the final packaging for the
[SPEAKER_00]: customer and then put it into the walk-in
cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're up to five touches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then someone would take it out of the
walk-in cooler and put it in our delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicle and drive to town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six touches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then unload it from the vehicle,
deliver it to the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven touches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm being very specific here because it's
really incredible how much more profitable
[SPEAKER_00]: we are after we wrapped our mind around
this concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Lean would suggest using what they
call single piece flow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, we had seven touches that
added value to the lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we touched that, it gained in
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Lean says to do is add as much
value as possible to the product in your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand before you say, get it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way I like to word it is to harvest as
market ready as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on the example of our lettuce,
our current process is someone cuts the
[SPEAKER_00]: head and while the lettuce is in their
hands, they strip the bad leaves off the
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they dunk it in a bucket of water
that they've taken out into the field with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still in their hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they give it a little shake and
they'll tie a twisty or wrap it in plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they put it in the final
container going to the customer out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have again set up so that final
containers aren't touching the ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're harvesting and placing it in the
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're still on our first touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't set down the head of lettuce
and yet we've added value in four
[SPEAKER_00]: different processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the person, we've stopped
actually using a walk-in cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, we back up a refrigerated
delivery vehicle to the location the item
[SPEAKER_00]: is harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to load it directly in
that refrigerated delivery vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within an hour, it's off to our
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the reasons we wanted to get
rid of the walk-in cooler was motion waste
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's an extra motion of putting
it in the cooler and taking it out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two touches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for most of our crops, we're getting
away with three or four touches instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: seven or eight touches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually has increased our profits
by almost twice as much because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: spending half the amount of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like a big change when
you list it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds so stupidly simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stupidly simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet small changes like that make such
a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the course of the year,
we're talking hours and hours of savings
[SPEAKER_01]: in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use the example, I believe,
in your talk of putting a letter together,
[SPEAKER_01]: sealing an envelope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my mind, when you mentioned it,
my first thought was, well, you'd have
[SPEAKER_01]: three people and the first person would
put the letter in and put it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next person would pick it up and seal
the envelope with water or lick the
[SPEAKER_01]: adhesive and then put it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last person would put the stamp on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be the fastest way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's actually way more efficient for
one person to do all three of those steps
[SPEAKER_01]: without setting the letter down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I have enough time with groups,
I'll have one person come up front and do
[SPEAKER_00]: the single piece flow process with the
letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll have someone come up and do
a batch and queue system, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: where you fold 100 letters and then you
stuff 100 letters and then you stamp 100
[SPEAKER_00]: letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's amazing how the single piece flow
people are consistently at least twice as
[SPEAKER_00]: quick as the batch and queue people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet it's counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that it's more efficient to work
in large batches, but it actually isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's better for the employee
because it's more interesting to do
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it also reduces the amount of
fatigue or risk of injury because you are
[SPEAKER_01]: moving around more and you're not doing
just the same repetitive motion,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least as repetitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a ton of benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also under minimize moves,
you talk about spaghetti diagrams and
[SPEAKER_01]: drawing up a picture of everywhere that
you walk in a given space doing a task.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on that real quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another very simple technique
that a farm can use to quickly shave a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of mudo off your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you do is pick the one or two
hours when you're the busiest,
[SPEAKER_00]: when there's the most motion happening,
and then have someone stand in a corner of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room or on a balcony where they can
oversee the whole farm and just have a
[SPEAKER_00]: blank sheet of paper and just trace
motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did people move and when did a
product move?
[SPEAKER_00]: When was there motion on the farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: And after about 45 minutes or an hour,
it's going to look like a plate of
[SPEAKER_00]: spaghetti noodles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you can do is have everyone
huddle around and ask three questions of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plate of spaghetti noodles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one is how could we have shortened
some noodles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, how could we have straightened
some noodles?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third is how could we have
eliminated some noodles?
[SPEAKER_00]: And ideally, you eliminate a bunch of
noodles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use this process, we're actually
setting up a new farm right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use spaghetti diagrams to help
define where building should be and help
[SPEAKER_00]: set up our process in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do several rounds of pretend
harvesting head lettuce, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and determine the shortest routes for the
head lettuce, the straightest lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what actually ultimately led us to is
to build one large building, a hoof,
[SPEAKER_00]: in which we have our house or processing
area, storage area, a potting shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a bunch of functions that are in
one building to eliminate a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: noodles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we kept our growing areas very
close to the process scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've eliminated as many lines of work
as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's more types of Muda and tools
for reducing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to give away everything in
the book because I think it's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: visualize it and read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to keep this moving along since
I know we have a limited amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk a little bit about the idea of
continuous improvement, how this process
[SPEAKER_01]: never really ends for you and what that
looks like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially when it comes, this is a
little bit heretical with farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nearly every farm book you read or video
course or whatever, everyone thinks they
[SPEAKER_00]: figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They figured out the best way to make
compost or the best way to grow tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to sell you all their
secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second book gives you all of our
production secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells you where we're at in the lean
process with producing tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_00]: peppers and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the point is just to give you
inspiration for your own lean thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: because there never is a perfect way to do
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always about continuously improving
your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a better way to do
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phrase they use in lean is no problem
is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you have no problems,
then that's your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, so essentially what continuous
improvement or Kaizen means is you perform
[SPEAKER_00]: the first three steps of the lean system
with more precision every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get more decluttered every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step is that 5S and organize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get more organized every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get more junk off the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then number two, you get more
precisely identified value from your
[SPEAKER_00]: customers every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to know them deeper and you
deliver more value to them every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then third is with Muda's,
you'd get rid of even more of the Muda's
[SPEAKER_00]: every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's overproduction waste, waiting
waste, transportation waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: over-processing, inventory waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be Muda in your
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every year you just chink a little bit
more off of your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like this sculpture analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite analogy for lean is that
it's like your farm is a big log and every
[SPEAKER_00]: year you chisel a little more waste off
the farm until you have a very beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: sculpture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pure value.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've chiseled all the waste off of it
and you just keep honing it and polishing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember you mentioning that even at
Toyota, they had managers that got in
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they weren't changing and updating
the standards consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't continually looking with a
really fine eye to be improving the
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a never ending process of
improvement, like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's an important factor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they used to mandate that once a
month the processes had to change in some
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they mandated change, mandated
continuous improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And can we talk a little bit about how
this lean process affects your staff and
[SPEAKER_01]: the morale around the farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing with Kaizen or continuous
improvement is it's often you want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be an all staff project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is your workers are as
close to the waste or sometimes closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: the waste as you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's no reason to not let them
help you root out the waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what T.
[SPEAKER_00]: G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ono at Toyota, he helped design lean
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to say that workers come to Toyota
to think, not to build cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a manufacturing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're often repeating tasks over and
over again, but he said, ultimately people
[SPEAKER_00]: come here to think, not to build cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it means is that you have
engaged staff people who are not just
[SPEAKER_00]: picking tomatoes or stuffing on volt
lobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they are doing is thinking as they're
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is we keep a list of the
waste, a list of the mood is in the center
[SPEAKER_00]: of our processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we instruct our workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say, Hey, we want you, if you see one
of these types of ways, we want to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: first ones to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we encourage them to kind of ruffle
our feathers and to think of a better,
[SPEAKER_00]: better ways of doing things, which is
counter-cultural in our culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Workers are trained, especially in
agriculture to just go out and pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, they're not thought of as,
uh, as managers and everyone should take
[SPEAKER_00]: some management responsibility to make the
process more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives people more ownership.
[SPEAKER_01]: A feeling of ownership of their space and
their job and what they're doing and the
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for us, I'm finding it's improving
morale because people are excited to see
[SPEAKER_01]: these changes as we're making them around
our property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I wanted to touch on,
uh, because most of the people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to this, that are cultivating,
uh, that are doing it commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is their business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much easier to cut costs than to grow
your profit margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you mentioned, it's a lot easier
to reduce costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: To reduce a thousand dollars worth of
expenses than it is to sell $2,000 worth
[SPEAKER_01]: of new product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can maintain your sales,
which I think is something you said you've
[SPEAKER_01]: done over the years is maintain your sales
level, but reduced your expenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's all money in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to grow more, to produce more product
involves Muda.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have the Muda of
construction of another greenhouse or mill
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing that your infrastructure for
growing system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have the Muda of training
new workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a lot of effort that goes into
producing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can grow your business also by
trimming out costs and waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't have to deal with all
those Muda's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just save money and, and,
and add to your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very simple secret of our farm is
that we would be making, we've been a
[SPEAKER_00]: grossing six figures for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we haven't always netted a whole
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had started to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is every year we print out an
expense lecture and we say, we ask the
[SPEAKER_00]: question, Hey, where's the 5%?
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, how can we trim 5% off of
our expense ledger and still produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: same or more next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: And who couldn't, you know, scour the
expense ledger and come up with 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you do this over the course of
10 years, which we have, then you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: your business by 50%, which is a very
respectable rate of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow your net profit by that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you didn't have to produce more in the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's pure, it's pure profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that at some point all
businesses need new customer, need more
[SPEAKER_00]: customers and need to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is become, it becomes a,
it becomes an addiction in our culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another way to grow a
business, which is to cut out the Muda's
[SPEAKER_00]: and get more precise on adding value too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every year we try to replace low profit
items with higher profit items and give
[SPEAKER_00]: our customers more value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we charge more for our products
and we're getting more from our customers
[SPEAKER_00]: for the same amount of effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: One concrete example for me was also
working with the people that we buy things
[SPEAKER_01]: from or that we work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, changing or renegotiating my
merchant service rate on credit cards made
[SPEAKER_01]: a difference of almost $15,000 in a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that's money that I get to
put back towards the farm, towards my
[SPEAKER_01]: employees, not into the pocket of a
merchant service provider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So expenses are huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one place that we need
to look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love how thoughtful you are before
you make a change on your farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of times we're running
around so crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, we don't take the time to really
give thought to the process or even to
[SPEAKER_01]: buying a new tool or a new piece of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just are constantly trying to move
forward without evaluating, do we need
[SPEAKER_01]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the best tool for the job?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this adding value?
[SPEAKER_01]: All the questions that you're asking in
your book are just so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one thing you mentioned at the end of
the book that I think is interesting is
[SPEAKER_01]: that lean is a style of cultivation or an
attitude towards farming, but it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: taken too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little about what that
looks like and what you meant in that
[SPEAKER_01]: section?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think in particular, like let's
say you're dealing with, you're an animal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a protein producer, you raise
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what, one of the core tenants of
lean is you want to maximize your fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so fixed costs for me would be a
greenhouse or process, fixed costs for a
[SPEAKER_00]: hog producer would be a hog house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what lean would suggest is that you
want to stuff as many hogs as possible and
[SPEAKER_00]: into the hog house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen lean use this in agriculture
with milk production and you want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: as many gallons of milk out of that animal
as possible and you're going to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: the investment you have in the animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there are just some ethical
considerations you need to use in farming
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to use the lean system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also suggest that farmers who
try to stuff as many hogs as possible in
[SPEAKER_00]: their hog house are not probably applying
a value analysis as lean would suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, are their customers
actually wanting them to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the process their customers want?
[SPEAKER_00]: And lean says, like I said, start with a
customer, work backwards from the
[SPEAKER_00]: customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that'd be one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with vegetable or grain crop
producers, I think there are all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to use more fossil fuels on our farms
to increase production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think we have to ask,
is this what our customers are wanting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this what the process our community
wants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, you can't take lean too far in an
agricultural context.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, an example of this on our end
would be choosing where we source the
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients that we put into our soils,
for example, because we manufacture soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And knowing to me, I know our customers
value using high quality ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I were to go out and source a
cheaper ingredient in that mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wouldn't be providing value,
even though it would be lowering my
[SPEAKER_01]: expenses, because it might lower the
quality of my actual product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you mentioned, ethics is so
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to protect the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to come up with sustainable
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And conventional agriculture isn't
necessarily all that sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where it falls down in
relation to lean manufacturing concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cost cutting is not necessarily
lean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost cutting can be very un-lean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't steer your business in the
direction what your customers are wanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last question I had for you,
was, as I mentioned to you, this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you're not able to cultivate
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there anything you'd like to add or
touch on on the topic before we sign off
[SPEAKER_01]: for the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that it'd be great if Indiana
would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, we've been working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Indiana is, they're talking about some
legislation now that would make medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the process, that lean
system is a universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to close with saying lean system is
a universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a universal system in that the types
of waste are prevalent in any type of
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's no reason you can't use
lean with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you grow one marijuana plant
or if you have tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, the lean system is applicable no
matter what size business you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many workers you have, or who your
customer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something you can gain from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can become more profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can create a more pleasant work
environment for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's so important because we
want to spend our time doing other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This allows you more free time to spend
with your family and more time to spend
[SPEAKER_01]: doing things that you want to be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that you don't love your work,
but finding ways to reduce your expenses,
[SPEAKER_01]: increase your bottom line, and make your
life more efficient I think is a win all
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to say again,
Ben has two books out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put links to both of them on the
podcast page as well as some photos and
[SPEAKER_01]: other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I highly recommend people check out
your books.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate you taking the
time today to come on the podcast and chat
[SPEAKER_01]: with me about lean farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Ben Hartman, author of The Lean
Farm and The Lean Farm Guide to Growing
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't recommend his books enough and I
hope listeners will incorporate at least
[SPEAKER_01]: one aspect of lean farming into your
growing practices as a way of becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficient in reducing waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to the Cannabis
Cultivation and Science podcast.
