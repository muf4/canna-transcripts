[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, Tad here with KISS Organics and
today I'm here to show you an unboxing of
[SPEAKER_00]: the newest light from BIOS lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Luna 1750.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for those of you less familiar with
BIOS, BIOS is a NASA spinoff founded in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014 on the Florida Space Coast,
originating from projects at the Space
[SPEAKER_00]: Life Sciences Lab and Kennedy Center to
grow plants in space and help astronauts
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate their sleep on the International
Space Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't had a chance, you can check
out my review of the BIOS Endeavour
[SPEAKER_00]: multibar light on our YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running it in my garden and I
love how little it weighs, making it easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to hang and adjust and the light output
and uniformity is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten solid yields with good terpene
expression across multiple harvests and
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS uses the same spectrum in their
Endeavour and Luna lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today they use these discoveries to
revolutionize lighting for human wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: and growing plants on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with a lot of different LED
companies over the years and now I work
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusively with BIOS for a few reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost is because I believe
they have one of the best lights
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially available on the market in
terms of build quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really see that NASA engineering
coming through and the quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting they're producing and they also
have the best customer service of any
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting company I've ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, they have the best
warranty that's out there on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: today, a seven-year warranty on the
fixture and a five-year warranty on the
[SPEAKER_00]: power supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's get into the specs on the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light works on a range of 120 to 277
volts or you can get a different power
[SPEAKER_00]: supply that works on 277 to 488 volts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fixture is approximately 38 inches
long by four and a half inches wide and
[SPEAKER_00]: four inches tall and weighs 12.2 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power supply can be mounted next to
the fixture or further away using a jumper
[SPEAKER_00]: cable and it weighs 7.4 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light is 635 watts with a PAR efficacy
of 2.76 U moles per second and a PPF of
[SPEAKER_00]: 1750 U moles per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The housing on the light is cold-forged
aluminum and tempered glass over the
[SPEAKER_00]: diodes so you can easily wipe them down
and clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crucial not only for IP PM but
also to maintain efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights without glass coverings may list
slightly better efficacy but in everyday
[SPEAKER_00]: usage I would expect it to drop quickly as
the diodes become dirty or dusty and you
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot clean them effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light also has an IP 66 waterproof
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: An IP 66 rating is protected against
multi-directional high-pressure water so
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to worry about damaging
your light when spraying and it's easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean and it's the highest rating a
fixture can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS customizes both the cabling and the
lighting layout because everyone has a
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly different grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you contact me directly through Kiss
Organics we can get you a custom lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: layout that would show you how the lights
potentially overlap and what sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: homogeneity you would have throughout your
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so I wanted to shoot a quick video
showing you how easy it is to hang the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it weighs so little I can hold it
with one hand while attaching the hangers
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the quick connect cables they
just snap in and do a half twist to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: a solid electrical connection with no risk
of them coming apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally plug-and-play right out of
the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so now we are back in the grow
room I have the lights hung up I have the
[SPEAKER_00]: Luna and I hung it up next to the
Endeavour so that you could see the two
[SPEAKER_00]: side-by-side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these lights are from BIOS and the
Endeavour I already did an unboxing video
[SPEAKER_00]: of that you can check out on our YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would never really run these lights
side-by-side you choose one design or the
[SPEAKER_00]: other but I did want to show you what they
look like next to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in terms of the light itself I'll post
on the video here I'll show you what the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual lighting layout is but just
checking it with my PAR meter right now as
[SPEAKER_00]: we start up close to the light here we're
up to 3,200 PPFD and then as we come down
[SPEAKER_00]: now I'm at about 2,000 right about here
directly under the light and then as I
[SPEAKER_00]: move away we're gonna see those light
levels drop as that angle changes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even at this distance we're at about a
thousand PPFD here and as we move out
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the edge of the bed here at an
angle by angle or meter we're about 550
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting quite high light levels
with the Luna and we're getting it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: very slim form factor so it's not going to
block any light coming in from the Sun say
[SPEAKER_00]: in a greenhouse and we can also pack these
closer together if you wanted to hit a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher overall PPFD in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching my review of the Luna
LED grow light from Bios Lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please reach out to either myself or Bios
if you have any questions or are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in a custom lighting layout for
your garden or facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
